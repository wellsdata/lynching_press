of the disgraceful affair:,16964_0.txt
It is generally known that we have two young,16964_0.txt
"men confined in our county jail, under sentence of",16964_0.txt
death for the murder of a Mr. Hewitt in October,16964_0.txt

last. The day fixed by the Court for their execú-,16964_0.txt
tion was the 20th instant. The time given them,16964_0.txt
to prepare for death was felt to be short; but it was,16964_0.txt
"about the limit assigned by the law, unless for",16964_0.txt
"cause shown, the Court or Governor might prolong",16964_0.txt
it. Special application being made to the Governor,16964_0.txt
", that functionary postponed the execution of",16964_0.txt

"Unfortunately, this application was made only a",16964_0.txt
few days before the time set by the Court had expired,16964_0.txt
", and the respite was not known here soon",16964_0.txt
enough to certify the public at a distance of the,16964_0.txt
change.,16964_0.txt
"On the evening of the 19th, the unusual concourse",16964_0.txt
of people from a distance gave token of the,16964_0.txt
anticipated event which had called them from their,16964_0.txt
homes. Dissatisfaction at the postponement of the,16964_0.txt
execution began to be manifested. People who had,16964_0.txt
left their business and come a long way to see two,16964_0.txt
"men hung, were not to be deprived of the sight",16964_0.txt
"with impunity. One unhappy man had, it seems,",16964_0.txt
"now twice in his life, walked all night to see somebody",16964_0.txt
"hung, and was a second time to fall short of",16964_0.txt
his lofty aspiration! It was too much. Such sore,16964_0.txt
bereavements in a free country were intolerable.,16964_0.txt
"It was, therefore, determined that, law or no law,",16964_0.txt
the hanging must come off. Menaces to this effect,16964_0.txt
did not at first create apprehension; as it was,16964_0.txt
"thought incredible that, whether to gratify a depraved",16964_0.txt
"appetite for carnage, or an idle curiosity,",16964_0.txt
or upon the pretence of meting out justice to the,16964_0.txt

"doubtless, it was that no sufficient organization for",16964_0.txt
the defence was effected in time by the proper,16964_0.txt
officers.,16964_0.txt
"On the morning of the 20th, the crowds from the",16964_0.txt
"country increased, and directed their course towards",16964_0.txt
the jai !; soon a vast throng was there concentrated,16964_0.txt
. The prisoners were demanded of the,16964_0.txt
"sheriff; but there was as yet little concert of action,",16964_0.txt
and no acknowledged leader.,16964_0.txt
"In the meantime, a gallows was erected on the",16964_0.txt

"every thing arranged, even to the hangman's",16964_0.txt
"noose, that the business might proceed whenever",16964_0.txt
the prisoners were brought forth. There was a,16964_0.txt
rope for each; but it is said that( by way of luxury,16964_0.txt
"perhaps) George was to be hanged first, and",16964_0.txt
"Tom obliged to stand by and look on, that the amiable",16964_0.txt
executioners might the better regale themselves,16964_0.txt
upon the agony which the sight and his,16964_0.txt
own impending doom would awaken.,16964_0.txt
"But not to extend this detail too far, it must suffice",16964_0.txt
"to say, that despite the efforts of a few inside",16964_0.txt
"and some outside, who were anxious to arrest proceedings",16964_0.txt
", the door of the jail was burst in, and the",16964_0.txt
"hall, up to the cells of the victims, filled with the",16964_0.txt
mob. Here the strength of the cell door brought,16964_0.txt
"them to a halt. Beams of timber, crow bars, stones",16964_0.txt
"and sledges, did the work, however, and the entrance",16964_0.txt
to both cells was effected. George was,16964_0.txt
"caught praying, and brought into the hall to await",16964_0.txt
the capture of Tom.,16964_0.txt
Here a slight obstacle again intervened. Tom,16964_0.txt
had concluded not to be taken. While the mob,16964_0.txt
"was at work without, he had managed to dig a stone",16964_0.txt
"from the floor of his cell, which he slid into the",16964_0.txt
"leg of a pair of cast off breeches, and stood on the",16964_0.txt
"defensive. But when the door was burst in, it",16964_0.txt
"seems he was taken a little by surprise, and some",16964_0.txt
"of the rabble entered. His adroitness, however,",16964_0.txt
"and the use of his slung shot, enabled him to get",16964_0.txt
"rid of them. He then posted himself at the door,",16964_0.txt
"which being low and narrow, but one could enter",16964_0.txt
"at a time, and as fast as any one attempted it, he",16964_0.txt
paid the forfeit. Three or four of them were,16964_0.txt
"knocked down, and the skull of one of them broken.",16964_0.txt
"Instruments of defence and attack were procured,",16964_0.txt
"but those he managed to capture, and used them",16964_0.txt
to fortify his position. Some one drew a pistol,16964_0.txt
and ordered him to surrender. He bared his breast,16964_0.txt
"and challenged the fellow to shoot, and said they",16964_0.txt
"might kill him where he was, or the Sheriff might",16964_0.txt
"take and hang him according to law, but that he",16964_0.txt
"would never be dragged out by a mob, and hung",16964_0.txt
like a dog.,16964_0.txt
"This fierce determination to sell his life dearly,",16964_0.txt
"and die in his tracks, had a mellowing and enlightening",16964_0.txt
influence upon the dense faculties of his assailants,16964_0.txt
. They began to moderate in their zeal for,16964_0.txt
"justice, and to think they were carrying matters",16964_0.txt
too far. The favorable moment was seized by the,16964_0.txt
"friends of order, and a proposition affording a loophole",16964_0.txt
"of escape from the ignominy of defeat, was",16964_0.txt
"made and accepted. After some parley, the jail",16964_0.txt
"was cleared, the gallows taken down, and the mob",16964_0.txt
dispersed. The performance was over- the mountain,16964_0.txt

of parturition ceased to be felt. Thus ended in,16964_0.txt

We have therefore a suggestion. Every week,17277_0.txt

of some metropolitan daily which tells of the,17277_0.txt

The incident got scant mention over the radio and,17277_0.txt

Since our daily newspapers will headline the,17277_0.txt

"somewhere, it certainly seems reasonable that acts",17277_0.txt
of heroism on the part of Negroes should be given,17277_0.txt

much to help this situation by making full use of,17277_0.txt

Franklin county is not so large a county that,17381_0.txt
any mob could assemble in daylight and take a,17381_0.txt
prisoner from the sheriff and a deputy without the,17381_0.txt
overwhelming probability that the sheriff or the,17381_0.txt
deputy would know some of the men. There were,17381_0.txt
no masks and no efforts on the part of the lynchers,17381_0.txt
to conceal their identities. Others in Louisburg,17381_0.txt
saw the men who lynched the negro. Everything,17381_0.txt
was done in the light of day and under the eyes,17381_0.txt
of men. The body was still hanging to the tree,17381_0.txt
when a jury empaneled by Coroner R. A. Bobbitt,17381_0.txt
took only five minutes to return the verdict which,17381_0.txt

very outrageous in his language and conduct,17396_0.txt

"had for his instant execution, and we regret to",17396_0.txt
say that as the committee were proceeding with,17396_0.txt

was taken and hanged immediately in front of the,17396_0.txt
"Court House. We deeply deplore this event, but",17396_0.txt
"if Lynch law is ever justifiable, it is so in this",17396_0.txt
case. It turns out that this Wise has for the last,17396_0.txt
twenty years made the agitation of the slavery,17396_0.txt
question his chief business. By means of it he,17396_0.txt
has risen to a seat in Congress and to the Govering,17396_0.txt
"nor's chair. His career is now cut short, and we",17396_0.txt
hope his awful fate will be a warning to all Abo-,17396_0.txt
litionist emissaries. The developments of to- day,17396_0.txt
leave no doubt that the punishment was justly inflicted,17396_0.txt
. In Wise's house were found copies of,17396_0.txt
"speeches by Seward, Samner, Wilson, Wade, and",17396_0.txt

to take good care of the children. They then,17401_1.txt

The Bisbee incident has about,17424_0.txt
run itself out as a political issue.,17424_0.txt
After all the hullabaloo and noise,17424_0.txt
the whole matter settles down,17424_0.txt
to simply a mob of outraged citizens,17424_0.txt
rising up in their wrath and,17424_0.txt
ridding the community of a gang,17424_0.txt
of undesirable citizens. Mob,17424_0.txt
law under any circumstances is,17424_0.txt
"always a violation of the statutes,",17424_0.txt
and is only justified when the,17424_0.txt

A mob of citizens hung a brute,17424_0.txt

and on the same basis of the,17424_0.txt
Bisbee incident the actors should,17424_0.txt
be indicted and prosecuted. The,17424_0.txt
Bisbee affair differs because a lot,17424_0.txt
of partisan politics was injected,17424_0.txt
into it by the Gov. Hunt wing of,17424_0.txt
democracy which is builded,17424_0.txt
largely on sentimental criminology,17424_0.txt
", which believes law violators",17424_0.txt
should be the pampered pets,17424_0.txt
of society. The Bisbee deportation,17424_0.txt
was not an assault on organized,17424_0.txt
"labor in any way, as",17424_0.txt
there were several thousand,17424_0.txt

"always a grafter, who is willing",17424_0.txt
to sell out labor to the employer,17424_0.txt
any time when the financial consideration,17424_0.txt
is sufficient. That is,17424_0.txt
the way he makes his living.,17424_0.txt

element. That is the reason,17424_0.txt

TEXAS FIRST TO REPLY,17425_0.txt
On last Friday there appeared striking headlines in most of the daily,17425_0.txt
papers featuring President Wilson's message on mob law. The President's,17425_0.txt
"statement, which was addressed to"" My Fellow Countrymen"", is thought to",17425_0.txt
have been inspired by the numerous lynchings of which suspected pro- Ger-,17425_0.txt

mans were the.,17425_0.txt
"In this message, the President' points out that every lynching is a blow",17425_0.txt
"at the heart of law and justice, and directly opposed to the principles for",17425_0.txt
"which America, as a Democracy, stands.",17425_0.txt
""" How shall he asks of",17425_0.txt

"other people if we disgrace our own by proving that it is, after all, no protection",17425_0.txt
"to the weak?""",17425_0.txt
In this stirring denunciation of mob rule and this plea to all Americans,17425_0.txt
""" to make an end of this disgraceful evil,"" the President placed the lynchers",17425_0.txt
squarely on the side of Germany by declaring that any man who even so,17425_0.txt
"much as countenanced mob action, is a betrayer of American Democracy and",17425_0.txt
"adopts the standards of the enemy of his country, whom he affects to",17425_0.txt

"Of the southern States, Texas proudly claims the distinction of being",17425_0.txt

sent broadcast over the country the next day and read something like this:,17425_0.txt

that he and his people stand squarely behind President Wilson in waging,17425_0.txt

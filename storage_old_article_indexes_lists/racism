Race
The White Man's Burden Burden Man's White
MILLER KELLY By
T
HE LATE MR. DOOLEY used to say that the trouble with the
Negro is that he is too easily lyrched. To paraphrase Mr. Doug-
lass' expression: "The race that is lynched easiest is lynched
u.terest" The Negro, being the most frequent victim of mob violence,
makes the greatest outcry against the barbarity and iniquity of it. The
man who feels the wound will utter the groan.
But on thoughtful analysis it readily appears that the white man is on thoughtful analysis it readily appears that the white man is
is the greater sufferer from the
mob malady, albeit the Negro bears
the heaviest brunt of affliction.
The reactionary effect of the rabies
of race hatred which prompts
nching is well described by the
post Goldsmith in his well known
nes on "A Mad Dog":Tas
R and man at first were
friends.

filed in 1993 and 1995. These law-

Well, in Florida a little while
ago, they lynched two Negro boys
right under the governor's nose,
and I never learned the truth back
of the motive for the lynching
until I came south, and perhaps
never would have learned it through
any word written from Florida.

lynching history violence
Firearms Laws Laws
There is no need pretending that America is just
now, turning to violent spasms. History does not sup-
port this emotional assessment. America has always
been a land of violence. We love it. We love to fight
and kill. The frontier days made the gun manly. For
years, lynching of Negroes was looked upon as a tra-
ditional Southern ritual that even the North was in-
clined to respect and even imitate.
Thousand or more Negroes met their deaths by
lynch mobs whose actions did not so much as cause
a ripple of public indignation. What's more, for dec-
ades, Congress had refused to legislate against
lynching. It took refuge into the reasoning that such
legislation would be an invasion of the police power
of the state. It was not until the passage of the 1957
Civil Rights Act was this legalism knocked down.
In the last four years, in the state of Missis-
sippi alone, 46 Negroes have been killed without a
single conviction of the perpetrators of the crimes.
It is only just now that American conscience is
awakening to the embarrassing moral lapse. Ghetto
riots causing destruction of high-income, slum prop-
erty of absentee white landlords, and the assassina-
tion of prominent citizens are bringing to the fore
blood since the birth of this nation.
Despite the fact that both Dr. Martin Luther
King and Senator Robert Francis Kennedy used all
the rhetoric at their command to arouse the national
conscience against violence, they met death by vio-
lence.

as a line of fire. The South would see no way of dealing with slavery
except to strengthen and fortify it at every point. Its extinction they
would not contemplate. Even a suggestion for its amelioration was
regarded as dangerous to the safety of the State and to the sacredness
of the family.
WHO PAYS FOR THE EDUCATION OF THE NEGRO IN
THE SOUTH?
THE Rev. Jno. J. Tigert, D. D., Fraternal Delegate from the Meth-
odist Episcopal Church, South, in his address delivered before the
General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church at Omaha, Ne-
braska, May 17, 1892, said:
"Up to January, 1889, eleven of the former Slave States had expended more
than $37,000,000 in the maintenance of normal and public schools for the Negro
youth, poor Mississippi leading the van with $7,136,800. If we allow $4,000,000
per annum as the sum raised for the same purpose during the three and a half
years since these figures were obtained, the Southern States have raised, since the
war, in round numbers, $50 000,000 for the education of the negro. This is the ac-

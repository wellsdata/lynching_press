"Montgomery, September 14 .-( Special.)-",89075_0.txt
Acting Governor Cunningham wired Capt.,89075_0.txt
R. L. Hay of the Huntsville military company,89075_0.txt
"yesterday afternoon, asking if he",89075_0.txt
had received a request from the executive,89075_0.txt
office to report on his connection with,89075_0.txt
the effort to keep a mob from lynching,89075_0.txt
Horace Maples at Huntsville last week,89075_0.txt
and if he had replied to the same.,89075_0.txt
Captain Hay telegraphed back that his,89075_0.txt
The,89075_0.txt
report would be sent in at once.,89075_0.txt
length of time elapsing after the request,89075_0.txt
of the governor for a statement,89075_0.txt
from Captain Hay had been remarked upon,89075_0.txt
"on the outside, though it was not",89075_0.txt
known until today that the governor had,89075_0.txt
taken official notice of it.,89075_0.txt
Captain Hay was in command of the,89075_0.txt
soldiers called out at Huntsville to assist,89075_0.txt
Sheriff Rogers in the protection of Maples,89075_0.txt
", and he and his men were under",89075_0.txt
the orders of the sheriff. The day after,89075_0.txt
the lynching the go rnor wrote Sheriff,89075_0.txt
Rogers and Captain Hay to give him at,89075_0.txt
once a detailed satement of everything,89075_0.txt
that occurred an indicate why they,89075_0.txt
had not been able to protect the prisoner,89075_0.txt
. Sheriff Rogers answered some days,89075_0.txt
"ago, though the governor has not seen fit",89075_0.txt
to divulge the contents of his letter.,89075_0.txt
It has also been very manifest within,89075_0.txt
the past two or three days that the federal,89075_0.txt
authorities are going to take a hand,89075_0.txt
in the attempt to punish the members of,89075_0.txt
the mob who lynched Maples. It is reliably,89075_0.txt
reported and has been so printed in,89075_0.txt
the papers that the matter will be presented,89075_0.txt
to the grand jury which assembles,89075_0.txt
in October and t it is not at all improbable,89075_0.txt

men will be assigne to duty on,89075_0.txt
case. the,89075_0.txt
Something Will Be Doing.,89075_0.txt
It is a well authenticated fact that,89075_0.txt
something of much more importance than,89075_0.txt
has ever been brought to pass as the result,89075_0.txt
"of a lynching in Alabama, is coming",89075_0.txt
from the Huntsville affair. The fact that,89075_0.txt
Governor Cunningham has already begun,89075_0.txt
and is pushing the investigation so far,89075_0.txt
"as his office is concerned, is no secret.",89075_0.txt
It is also an open secret that officials of,89075_0.txt
the United States are casting about to,89075_0.txt
see just where they can take hold and,89075_0.txt
bring the power of Uncle Sam to bear in,89075_0.txt
the of the,89075_0.txt
location and punishment,89075_0.txt

Judge Speake of the state court has,89075_0.txt
called and has in session a special meeting,89075_0.txt
"of the state grand jury, and, with",89075_0.txt
"Solicitor Pettus, is busy trying to get information",89075_0.txt
on which to predicate indictments,89075_0.txt
", all going to prove that no part of",89075_0.txt
the machinery of justice is allowed to,89075_0.txt
lie idle in,89075_0.txt
the,89075_0.txt
this movement to rid,89075_0.txt
state of the stain of the unlawful taking,89075_0.txt
of human life.,89075_0.txt
The fact that the governor urged Captain,89075_0.txt
"Hay to hurry his report, for his telegram",89075_0.txt
"amounted to that, indicates how",89075_0.txt
vigorously he has determined to act. He,89075_0.txt
will see that everything in his power is,89075_0.txt
exercised to secure names of men in the,89075_0.txt
mob and their conviction when discovered,89075_0.txt
.,89075_0.txt
United States' Part.,89075_0.txt
It is expected that the United States,89075_0.txt
officials will proceed on the supposition,89075_0.txt
that the action of the mob was in violation,89075_0.txt
of section 5508 of the revised statutes,89075_0.txt
"of the United States, which make it a",89075_0.txt
penalty to form a conspiracy against any,89075_0.txt
"citizen of the United States, and provides",89075_0.txt
further for the punishment of any who,89075_0.txt
"may, by conspiracy, cause the injury of",89075_0.txt
"a citizen of the United States, though",89075_0.txt
they may not have intended to inflict,89075_0.txt
such injury.,89075_0.txt
In the case of Logan vs. The United,89075_0.txt
"States, from the northern district of",89075_0.txt
"Texas, the supreme court of the United",89075_0.txt
States( 144 Rpt. U. S. S. C.) held that,89075_0.txt
any citizen in the custody of an officer,89075_0.txt
of the government had a right to the protection,89075_0.txt
"of the United States, and any",89075_0.txt
who offered or did him injury while in,89075_0.txt
such custody was liable to heavy punishment,89075_0.txt
; also that such action was in violation,89075_0.txt
of section 5508 above mentioned.,89075_0.txt
The supposition is that the United Staes,89075_0.txt
"attorney, the Hon. Thomas R. Roulhac",89075_0.txt
of Sheffield will take the matter up,89075_0.txt
and see that it is properly presented to,89075_0.txt

"tober sitting. It is also thought that, in",89075_0.txt
"anticipation of this investigation, it would",89075_0.txt
not be an overstepping of the rules of,89075_0.txt

locating those who are likely be,89075_0.txt
classed as offenders. to,89075_0.txt
Power of Governor.,89075_0.txt
The powers of the state executive are,89075_0.txt
limited in cases of this kind to the punishment,89075_0.txt
of officials who may have been,89075_0.txt
"false to their duties. He can, if he thinks",89075_0.txt
"the circumstances justify, cause impeach-",89075_0.txt
n.ent proceedings before the supreme,89075_0.txt
court to be filed against the sheriff of,89075_0.txt
any county. It is also within his power,89075_0.txt
to order the courtmartial of any member,89075_0.txt
of the citizen soldiery who fails in,89075_0.txt
his duty. Beyond this he can go no further,89075_0.txt
than to advise with the officials of,89075_0.txt
"the judicial system, and others who may",89075_0.txt
"have, by virtue of the statute, power to",89075_0.txt
punish those who violate any of the laws,89075_0.txt
of the state.,89075_0.txt
In following out these regulations the,89075_0.txt
governor at once ordered Sheriff Rogers,89075_0.txt
and Captain Hay to report all they knew,89075_0.txt
of the lynching. They were to give in,89075_0.txt
"detail all that was of importance, and",89075_0.txt
"to ascertain, in the case of the sheriff, if",89075_0.txt
"possible, names of members of the mob.",89075_0.txt
In addition to this the governor wrote,89075_0.txt
Judge Speake that he hoped he would,89075_0.txt
proceed as vigorously as possibly in the,89075_0.txt
investigation of the mob and suggested,89075_0.txt
that he call a special session of the,89075_0.txt
"grand jury. Judge Speake, feeling the",89075_0.txt
greatest interest in the maintenance of,89075_0.txt
"order in his circuit, had determined to",89075_0.txt
call this session and before the letter of,89075_0.txt
the governor had gotten to Birmingham,89075_0.txt
"cn its way to Huntsville, he called upon",89075_0.txt
the' phone the executive office here to,89075_0.txt
ask advice about it. The governor has,89075_0.txt
expressed the fullest confidence in both,89075_0.txt
Judge Speake and Solicitor Pettus and,89075_0.txt
will support them in every way possible.,89075_0.txt

The writer saw the governor in his office,89075_0.txt
this morning and asked about his,89075_0.txt
intentions regarding the Huntsville investigation,89075_0.txt
. He replied that he was not yet,89075_0.txt
"ready to give them to the press, further",89075_0.txt
than to say that he will do everything,89075_0.txt
the laws give him power to do to have,89075_0.txt
the whole matter sifted to the bottom,89075_0.txt
and those who are guilty of the crime of,89075_0.txt
murdering Horcae Maples will have to,89075_0.txt
suffer for it if he can bring it about.,89075_0.txt
He is waiting the report of Captain,89075_0.txt
"Hay, who commanded the militia,",89075_0.txt
he undertakes to decide definitely on before his,89075_0.txt
course of action. He has a letter from,89075_0.txt
Sheriff Rogers which he will not make,89075_0.txt
"public, in which that official gives his",89075_0.txt

"Choctaw Bluff, in at county, last week",89075_0.txt
is likely to cause a great deal of trouble.,89075_0.txt

now attracting no little attention in,89076_0.txt

The broad question raised in it relates,89076_0.txt
to the fourteenth amendment. A,89076_0.txt
member of the mob that lynched Hor-,89076_0.txt
ace Maples was indicted by a federal,89076_0.txt
"grand jury, and he sued out a writ of",89076_0.txt

offense for which he was indicted is,89076_0.txt
"one against the state of Alabama, not",89076_0.txt
the United States.,89076_0.txt
The contention on the one side is,89076_0.txt
"that, as Horace Maples was a citizen",89076_0.txt
of the United States and was in jail,89076_0.txt
"awiting trial, he could not be deprived",89076_0.txt
"of life without the formality of a trial,",89076_0.txt

of that mob can be punished under,89076_0.txt

HUNTSVILLE CASE,89121_0.txt
Lawyers Deeply Interested in,89121_0.txt
Judge Jones' Charge.,89121_0.txt
A BIG QUESTION RAISED,89121_0.txt
Those Who Agree With Judge Jones,89121_0.txt
Say His Charge Was Made in,89121_0.txt
the Best Interests of,89121_0.txt
the State.,89121_0.txt
In view of the recent widespread discussion,89121_0.txt
of the charge delivered to a federal,89121_0.txt
grand jury at Huntsville by Judge,89121_0.txt
"Thomas G. Jones, in which he held that",89121_0.txt
the mob at that place had violated the,89121_0.txt
"thirteenth amendment to the constitution,",89121_0.txt
and were liable to indictment by a grand,89121_0.txt
"jury in the United States court, many",89121_0.txt
lawyers have given the question much,89121_0.txt
study but as yet there is considerable,89121_0.txt
difference of opinion as to the correctness,89121_0.txt
of the rather unique position.,89121_0.txt
For fear that Judge Jones might be,89121_0.txt
put in a false light before the people of,89121_0.txt
his state some of his friends say that,89121_0.txt
"he is eminently correct in his opinion,",89121_0.txt
and that he delivered the charge for the,89121_0.txt
welfare of the state. They say that he,89121_0.txt
"regrets that he is unable, on account of",89121_0.txt
"his judicial position, to answer some of",89121_0.txt
the attacks on him made in political,89121_0.txt
speeches.,89121_0.txt
Case of Horace Maples.,89121_0.txt
It will be remembered that Judge Jones,89121_0.txt
"took the position that Horace Maples, a",89121_0.txt
"negro, was lynched by a mob of white",89121_0.txt
"men, and calls attention to the fact that",89121_0.txt
"if he had been a white man, it is likely",89121_0.txt
that the law would have been allowed to,89121_0.txt
take its course. If the mob lynched Maples,89121_0.txt
"simply because he was a negro, it is argued",89121_0.txt
that the members thereof violated,89121_0.txt
the thirteenth amendment to the United,89121_0.txt
"States constitution, and are therefore liable",89121_0.txt
to indictment by federal grand juries. In,89121_0.txt
"other words, it is a novel idea of reaching",89121_0.txt
such crimes through the United States,89121_0.txt
"courts, which have heretofore been",89121_0.txt
deemed practically Impossible.,89121_0.txt
Lawyers who agree with the position,89121_0.txt
taken by Judge Jones give their views,89121_0.txt
in substance as follows:,89121_0.txt
Substance of Views.,89121_0.txt
The case of a citizen being taken out,89121_0.txt
"of the hands of the state, which is trying",89121_0.txt
"to afford him due process of law, when",89121_0.txt
"accused of crime, and putting him to",89121_0.txt
"death to prevent his having the right,",89121_0.txt
differs in a constitutional sense and consequence,89121_0.txt
from any other act of mob violence,89121_0.txt
. The citizen had a right or immunity,89121_0.txt
under the constitution to have the,89121_0.txt
"state afford him that protection, and",89121_0.txt
when men conspire to prevent the citizen,89121_0.txt
from being afforded that right they come,89121_0.txt
within section 5508 of the revised statutes,89121_0.txt
for depriving a citizen of the right secured,89121_0.txt
him by the constitution of the,89121_0.txt
United to States.,89121_0.txt
"The kuklux, as many will recall, when",89121_0.txt
they started out were inspired by good,89121_0.txt
"purposes, though effected illegally, but",89121_0.txt
they became plagues to the people and,89121_0.txt
bands of murderers. Finally in Harvey,89121_0.txt
"vs. United States, 106, U. S., the supreme",89121_0.txt
court held the statute about going in,89121_0.txt
"disguise on highways, etc., to be unconstitutional",89121_0.txt
", since it was so broad that it",89121_0.txt
covered assaults to deprive of rights dependent,89121_0.txt
"purely on state laws, as well as",89121_0.txt
those derived directly from the constitutions,89121_0.txt
. They never so intermingled that,89121_0.txt
the courts could not separate them.,89121_0.txt
Supreme Court Reasons.,89121_0.txt
One of the reasons given by the supreme,89121_0.txt
court for holding that the statute was,89121_0.txt
not justified by the Thirteenth amendment,89121_0.txt
"was that under it a"" mob of whites",89121_0.txt
could be indicted for injury to a white,89121_0.txt
"man"" or"" a mob of negroes for injury to",89121_0.txt
"a negro,"" etc. That difficulty does not",89121_0.txt
"arise in the Huntsville cases, nor was the",89121_0.txt
"question presented in any of the cases,",89121_0.txt
whether hanging a man when the state,89121_0.txt
"was trying to protect him, on accusation",89121_0.txt
"of crime, to prevent him having the process",89121_0.txt
"of law, fell within section 5508. The",89121_0.txt
supreme court was careful to state that,89121_0.txt
that was not the case they were deciding.,89121_0.txt
Every lawyer who has studied or knows,89121_0.txt
anything about the jurisprudence of the,89121_0.txt
United States knows that congress has,89121_0.txt
by no means exhausted its power to protect,89121_0.txt
the right of American citizens and,89121_0.txt
every Alabamian is made a citizen of the,89121_0.txt
United States as to matter or which the,89121_0.txt
constitution of the United States provides,89121_0.txt
. Some of the best judges and lawyers,89121_0.txt
in the United States have no doubt,89121_0.txt
that the supreme court will hold that the,89121_0.txt
"present legislation section 5508, covers the",89121_0.txt
case of taking a man from the authorl-,89121_0.txt
ties and putting him to death to prevent,89121_0.txt
"his having a trial, regardless of any",89121_0.txt

of the enjoyment of an immunity- the,89121_0.txt

spirit and promising loyalty to the governor,89132_0.txt

speeches were made by Judge J. A.,89132_0.txt
"Billbro, A. E. Goodhue, W. J. Boykin and",89132_0.txt
others.,89132_0.txt
When the committee presented resolutions,89132_0.txt
"the committee chairman. O. R. Hood,",89132_0.txt
"moved their adoption, and made a short",89132_0.txt
talk along the line of the sentiment they,89132_0.txt
"expressed. The last two paragraphs, however",89132_0.txt
", were not in the original draft, and",89132_0.txt
were submitted as amendments by Judge,89132_0.txt
Billbro and accepted and adopted. It was,89132_0.txt
stated and generally understood that the,89132_0.txt
resolutions as to loyalty to the governor,89132_0.txt
had no reference as to his action in the,89132_0.txt
Johnson case since the bar itself differed,89132_0.txt
"on that point, and more particularly because",89132_0.txt
that was not part of the business,89132_0.txt

Members of Bar Indignant.,89132_0.txt
"Members of the Gadsden bar, especially",89132_0.txt
"those who were heard, were indignant",89132_0.txt
that the county should have been outraged,89132_0.txt
"by the murder of Richardson, and there",89132_0.txt
finally crept in a criticism of officers who,89132_0.txt
surrendered to the mob. Mr. Goodhue was,89132_0.txt
frank and open in the statement that he,89132_0.txt
desired to press an investigation as to,89132_0.txt
"whether the sheriff, police or any officer",89132_0.txt
was remiss in his duty. He said that it,89132_0.txt
should be known what the sheriff did from,89132_0.txt
the time of the assault on the jail up to,89132_0.txt
the next morning at 7 o'clock. It should be,89132_0.txt
"brought out, he said, why the sheriff did",89132_0.txt
"not give the alarm, ring the fire bell or",89132_0.txt
something of the sort. The same applied,89132_0.txt
to policemen who did not give the alarm,89132_0.txt
so that the lynchers might be either prevented,89132_0.txt
from committing the crime or else,89132_0.txt
be detected and identified. Mr. Goodhue,89132_0.txt
said that he wished the sheriff had been,89132_0.txt
"present to note his assertion, that the",89132_0.txt
sheriff and his deputies ought not to speak,89132_0.txt
of the lynching in a light manner and,89132_0.txt
"should feel that they, too, had been outraged",89132_0.txt
.,89132_0.txt
Fed by Agitators.,89132_0.txt
Judge Billbro stated that the mob spirit,89132_0.txt
"existed; that it was fed by agitators, and",89132_0.txt
that everyone who added fuel to the,89132_0.txt
flame was guilty as an accomplice in the,89132_0.txt
lynching of Bunk Richardson. He did not,89132_0.txt
charge or even intimate that an officer,89132_0.txt
"had been derelict in his duty, but he said",89132_0.txt
the law required the sheriff to protect,89132_0.txt
prisoners even up to the point of giving,89132_0.txt
his own life to do so.,89132_0.txt
Boykin Explains Attitude.,89132_0.txt
Mr. Boykin explained and justified his,89132_0.txt
connection with the Johnson se. He,89132_0.txt
said that it had been brought to him,89132_0.txt
that statements had been made that,89132_0.txt
some negro organizations had sent in,89132_0.txt
money and paid him to take the stand,89132_0.txt
he did. This he indignantly denied and,89132_0.txt
explained that he saw Johnson only once,89132_0.txt
and never spoke to him or had any communication,89132_0.txt
with him at any time. The,89132_0.txt
Rev. J. W. Newman' and the Rev. H. C.,89132_0.txt
Kegley were called upon and approved,89132_0.txt
of the sentiment of the meeting as did,89132_0.txt
"Mayor Smith. E. W. Whipps, president",89132_0.txt
"of the Commercial club, was called upon",89132_0.txt
to convene that body at once to take action,89132_0.txt
"on the lynching, and agreed to",89132_0.txt
do so.,89132_0.txt
There can be no question that the people,89132_0.txt
of Gadsden are stirred up over this,89132_0.txt
matter. They are determined to have the,89132_0.txt
outside world understand the true sentiment,89132_0.txt
of the community and it was particularly,89132_0.txt
stated that the unalterable determination,89132_0.txt
of the Gadsden bar to uphold,89132_0.txt
the law should be understood in,89132_0.txt
Etowah county itself. The meeting of the,89132_0.txt
bar association was the initiative movement,89132_0.txt
of the civic and judicial bodies of,89132_0.txt

"stress was laid upon crime, murder",89134_1.txt
in particular. He said that he believed,89134_1.txt
that the failure to bring the perpetrators,89134_1.txt

.,89134_1.txt
to instruct each succeeding grand jury,89134_1.txt
to investigate this lynching until the,89134_1.txt

When the governor left Mobile Thurs-,89138_4.txt
day night there had been. held a meeting,89138_4.txt
of the best citizens of the city and he,89138_4.txt
was told that there would be no interference,89138_4.txt
with the carrying out of the law.,89138_4.txt
"However, Judge Semmes of the city court",89138_4.txt
had said that he would not try the negroes,89138_4.txt
with the military there. This position he,89138_4.txt
"receded from later, but too late to get",89138_4.txt
soldiers to the city.,89138_4.txt
Judge Said He Would Recede.,89138_4.txt
A request was made last night by a,89138_4.txt
mass meeting of the bar that soldiers be,89138_4.txt
sent there. At the same time the judge,89138_4.txt
wired the governor that he would recede,89138_4.txt
from his assertion that he would,89138_4.txt
not try the case with the troops on the,89138_4.txt
ground. The governor at once wired the,89138_4.txt
Judge of the action of the mass meeting,89138_4.txt
and said he would send troops if the,89138_4.txt
elvil authorities desired that he should.,89138_4.txt
At the same time he wired Sheriff Powers,89138_4.txt
at Birmingham to bring the prisoners,89138_4.txt
by Montgomery. The presumption is that,89138_4.txt
he would have either taken them off here,89138_4.txt
or sent a detail of soldiers to protect them,89138_4.txt
"from the mob. However, Sheriff Powers",89138_4.txt
had left for Mobile over the Southern,89138_4.txt

lives of scores of people. In a manner,89148_0.txt

guilty negro was swung up. The crowd,89148_0.txt
was cleared away and several volleys of,89148_0.txt

"Washington, May 24.- For the first time",89171_1.txt
"in so serious a case, the supreme court",89171_1.txt
of the United States will on next Tues.,89171_1.txt
day week undertake to mete out punishment,89171_1.txt
for the crime of contempt of the,89171_1.txt
"court itself, and the importance of the",89171_1.txt
occasion will be enhanced by the number,89171_1.txt
of the defendants.,89171_1.txt
The proceedings will take place in connection,89171_1.txt
with the cases of Sheriff Shipp,89171_1.txt
and Deputy Sheriff Gibson of Hamilton,89171_1.txt
"county, Tennessee, and four other residents",89171_1.txt
"of that county, named respectively",89171_1.txt
", Williams, Nolan, Padgett and May.",89171_1.txt
These were today declared by the,89171_1.txt

"in combining in March, 1905, in a conspiracy",89171_1.txt
"to lynch a negro, Ed Johnson,",89171_1.txt
who had been sentenced to death by,89171_1.txt
the local courts on the charge of rape,89171_1.txt
and in whose case the supreme court,89171_1.txt
had interfered to the extent of granting,89171_1.txt
an appeal which had the effect of a,89171_1.txt
"supersedeas. On, the night following the",89171_1.txt
announcement of the court's action John-,89171_1.txt
son was taken out of the jail in Chatta-,89171_1.txt
nooga by a mob and lynched. There,89171_1.txt
was no resistance on the part of the,89171_1.txt
jail authorities and Shipp and a number,89171_1.txt
"of his deputies, as well as about 20 citizens",89171_1.txt
", were proceeded against on the",89171_1.txt
charge of contempt of the federal court.,89171_1.txt
Case Long Pending.,89171_1.txt
"The case has been pending ever since,",89171_1.txt
and the number of defendants was from,89171_1.txt
time to time diminished to nine. Of these,89171_1.txt
"nine three today were found guiltless,",89171_1.txt
while the other six were ordered to be,89171_1.txt
brought into court next Tuesday week,89171_1.txt
for sentence. They will be taken into,89171_1.txt
custody immediately and will appear in,89171_1.txt
court in charge of Marshal Wright. The,89171_1.txt
sentence may be either fine or imprisonment,89171_1.txt
or both.,89171_1.txt
The case is regarded as of exceptional,89171_1.txt
interest because it is practically the first,89171_1.txt
"time that this, the highest court in the",89171_1.txt
"United States, has ever undertaken to",89171_1.txt
assert its dignity or to resent acts or,89171_1.txt
words reflecting upon it. In one previous,89171_1.txt
case years ago a defendant was fined,89171_1.txt
"for some expression of contempt, but the",89171_1.txt
case was so comparatively insignificant,89171_1.txt
as to practically leave the present proceeding,89171_1.txt
standing alone.,89171_1.txt
In the cases of Sheriff Shipp and Deputy,89171_1.txt
Sheriff Gibson the court declares,89171_1.txt
there may be contempt in the failure,89171_1.txt
of the officers of the law to prevent the,89171_1.txt
"crime, and taking cognizance of an offense",89171_1.txt
at so great a distance the court asserts,89171_1.txt
for the first time by action its right,89171_1.txt
to compel the proper respect for and,89171_1.txt
treatment of its verdicts in all parts of,89171_1.txt
the union.,89171_1.txt
In Custody of Court.,89171_1.txt
The charge of contempt against Sheriff,89171_1.txt
Shipp and his co- defendants was due to,89171_1.txt
the fact that when Johnson was lynched,89171_1.txt
he was constructively in the custody of,89171_1.txt
the court. Only a month before the negro,89171_1.txt
had been found guilty of the crime,89171_1.txt
of rape and had been sentenced to death.,89171_1.txt
The supreme court had taken cognizance,89171_1.txt
of the case by granting an appeal from,89171_1.txt
a decision of the United States circuit,89171_1.txt
"court, denying him a writ of habeas corpus",89171_1.txt
", which effected a stay of proceedings",89171_1.txt
in the convict's case. The appeal was allowed,89171_1.txt
"March 19, and that night Johnson",89171_1.txt
was taken out of jail at Chattanooga,89171_1.txt
and hanged. This action was strongly,89171_1.txt
"resented by the court, and immediately",89171_1.txt
the complaint was made to President,89171_1.txt
"Roosevelt, who ordered an investigation",89171_1.txt
by the department of justice. That investigation,89171_1.txt
resulted in the filing in the,89171_1.txt
"court by the attorney general in May,",89171_1.txt
"1906, of an"" information"" in which Shipp",89171_1.txt
and nine of his deputies and 17 other persons,89171_1.txt
were charged with complicity in,89171_1.txt
"the lynching, Shipp and some of his",89171_1.txt
subordinates by absenting themselves,89171_1.txt
from the jail on the night of the tragedy,89171_1.txt
and the others by actual participation in,89171_1.txt
it. The case aroused much interest in,89171_1.txt
the south because not only of the exceptional,89171_1.txt
"character of the proceeding, but",89171_1.txt
because of the popularity of Mr. Shipp,89171_1.txt
and the character of Johnson's crime.,89171_1.txt
Justice Harlan exercised an especial activity,89171_1.txt
in bringing the lynching to the,89171_1.txt
attention of the authorities. He had been,89171_1.txt
the first member of the court to take,89171_1.txt
notice of the offense and he seemed to,89171_1.txt
most keenly feel the indignity to the court,89171_1.txt
implied by the lynching. Deputy Clerk,89171_1.txt
Maher of the court was sent to Chatta-,89171_1.txt
nooga as a commisisoner to investigate,89171_1.txt
and take testimony. The Investigation,89171_1.txt
failed to connect with the crime 17 of,89171_1.txt
the men implicated and the cases against,89171_1.txt
them were dismissed at the beginning of,89171_1.txt
the present term.,89171_1.txt
Neglect of Duty.,89171_1.txt
The chief justice presented a complete,89171_1.txt
review of the Johnson case. He concluded,89171_1.txt
"that neither Shipp nor his deputy,",89171_1.txt
"Gibson, had made any effort to prevent",89171_1.txt
"the removal of Johnson from the jail, to",89171_1.txt
"prevent his killing after he was taken out,",89171_1.txt
nor to discover the participants in the,89171_1.txt
lynching after it took place.,89171_1.txt
It will lie with the court to determine,89171_1.txt
the degree of punishment that may be,89171_1.txt
inflicted upon the men found guilty.,89171_1.txt
Justice Peckham delivered a dissenting,89171_1.txt
"opinion, declaring that there was not",89171_1.txt
""" the slightest testimony to support the",89171_1.txt
"charge against Shipp.""",89171_1.txt
Justice Peckham concluded by asserting,89171_1.txt
"that Mr. Shipp, whom he described as",89171_1.txt
""" an invalid old man,"" had been held"" to",89171_1.txt
a degree of responsibility far beyond any,89171_1.txt
"reasonable limit."" He also held that the",89171_1.txt
"testimony against Deputy Gibson, who",89171_1.txt
"was the jailer, was insufficient to convict",89171_1.txt
him of contempt. Justices White and,89171_1.txt
McKenna concurred in the dissenting,89171_1.txt
opinion.,89171_1.txt

Murder of Mrs. Salzner.,89176_0.txt
One night last July Salzner's wife was,89176_0.txt
found at home with her skull fractured,89176_0.txt
and a blood covered ax was found under,89176_0.txt
the bed. The two babies were playing,89176_0.txt
in the yard. Salzner had been seen,89176_0.txt
by neighbors about the house early in,89176_0.txt
the evening and after the crime was discovered,89176_0.txt
Salzner was found at the honia,89176_0.txt
"of his mother, where he often slept at",89176_0.txt
"night,",89176_0.txt
All evidence pointed to Salzner as the,89176_0.txt
"slayer of his wife, and after the crime",89176_0.txt
was discovered Mrs. Salzner recovered,89176_0.txt
enough to accuse her husband of the,89176_0.txt
crime. The public,89176_0.txt
was incensed against,89176_0.txt
him and while a part of the mob was,89176_0.txt
scouring the city for the negro Alexander,89176_0.txt
time hung heavy on the hands of the,89176_0.txt
balance of the mob and when some one,89176_0.txt
suggested Salzner the mob rushed for,89176_0.txt
"the county jail, where the man wanted",89176_0.txt
was held in the steel cage.,89176_0.txt

"the cage, as it was an entirely steel",89176_0.txt
"structure, but after a half hour of telling",89176_0.txt
blows upon the door it gave way,89176_0.txt
and Salzner was secured. The mob rushed,89176_0.txt
"him out of the back door of the jail,",89176_0.txt
which is in the basement of the cou,89176_0.txt
"house, around the building, through the",89176_0.txt

a prominent corner and has a public,89176_0.txt
square and where there was room enough,89176_0.txt
to hold the crowd. Salzner was so badly,89176_0.txt
frightened that he was little more than,89176_0.txt
He cried,89176_0.txt
a crazy man. and begged,89176_0.txt
piteously for his life and was answered,89176_0.txt
by cries and blows from the mob.,89176_0.txt
When Salzner was asked for his last,89176_0.txt
"statement, a",89176_0.txt

"the mob fell upon the stranger, kicked,",89176_0.txt
"struck him, and finally knocked him",89176_0.txt
down and it was by hard work by the,89176_0.txt
cooler heads of the mob that his life,89176_0.txt
was saved. He was compelled to beg for,89176_0.txt
mercy from the mob and announced in,89176_0.txt
a loud voice that Salzner should be,89176_0.txt
"lynched, after which he was driven away",89176_0.txt

the body of the girl 65 knife wounds,89178_0.txt
were counted. She was literally cut,89178_0.txt
to pieces.,89178_0.txt
That the girl's assailant had other motives,89178_0.txt

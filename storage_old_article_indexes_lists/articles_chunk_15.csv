atrocity and without the mitigating circumstances,88481_0.txt
which had been urged in previous,88481_0.txt
affairs of this kind.,88481_0.txt
"In describing the first affray, which led",88481_0.txt

states that Dr. Hodges was the first,88481_0.txt
to draw his weapon and that until he had,88481_0.txt
fired one shot and was about to fire the,88481_0.txt
"second one at Charles Defata, who was at",88481_0.txt

"This last shot, it is pointed out, was in",88481_1.txt
"defense of the fallen brother, and was not",88481_1.txt
a wanton attack upon Dr. Hodges. The,88481_1.txt
circumstances leading up to the affray are,88481_1.txt
described in detail. According to this account,88481_1.txt
Charles Defata was alone when Dr.,88481_1.txt
Hodges passed. There is no effort made in,88481_1.txt
the report to obscure the fact that Charles,88481_1.txt
"Defata made the first offensive overture,",88481_1.txt
but it is contended that this was not accompanied,88481_1.txt
by the use of fire arms or even,88481_1.txt
"a movement to draw them. It is said,",88481_1.txt
"however, that Charles Defata upbraided",88481_1.txt
Dr. Hodges in an offensive way for having,88481_1.txt
killed an animal and accompanied this by,88481_1.txt
a blow of the fist. Then it is stated that,88481_1.txt
Dr. Hodges shot at Defata. Whether or,88481_1.txt
not the shot took effect it was not possible,88481_1.txt
"for the Italian authorities to learn, as the",88481_1.txt
bodies of the men after being lynched were,88481_1.txt
disfigured and disposed of. But all events,88481_1.txt
it is stated that Charles Defata was on the,88481_1.txt
ground following the shot from,88481_1.txt
"Hodges' weapon. At this point, Joe Defata Dr.",88481_1.txt
"made his appearance, and seeing his",88481_1.txt

Three Distinct Movements,88481_2.txt
Subsequently and a little afterwards the,88481_2.txt
mob returned and took John Cerami and,88481_2.txt
lynched him. In this circumstantial way,88481_2.txt
the report brings out that the mob made,88481_2.txt
three distinct movements against the,88481_2.txt
Italians and there was sufficient time for,88481_2.txt
the blood to cool and for the anger of the,88481_2.txt
lynchers to abate after they had disposed,88481_2.txt
of the first two men. Particular importance,88481_2.txt
"is laid upon this feature, for while",88481_2.txt
it is said there may have been some extenuating,88481_2.txt
circumstances in visiting such summary,88481_2.txt

they did not even know of it until some,88481_3.txt
time afterward when the officers came to,88481_3.txt
arrest them. The arrest was accomplished,88481_3.txt
and the three Italians were actually,88481_3.txt

day in the presence of four thousand people,88550_2.txt
. Henderson was arrested several days,88550_2.txt
ago and placed in jail at Waco. Later the,88550_2.txt
negro was spirited away to Hillsboro,88550_2.txt
"Last night the officers, fearing mob violence",88550_2.txt
", quietly arranged to take their prisoner",88550_2.txt
"to Fort Worth, and at 9 o'clock they",88550_2.txt
boarded a train. At Itasca. a dozen citizens,88550_2.txt
from Corsicana entered the car,88550_2.txt
where the officers and their prisoner were,88550_2.txt
seated and with drawn. revolvers demanded,88550_2.txt
that the negro be turned over to,88550_2.txt
them. After some parleying the mob got,88550_2.txt
the prisoner and in a short while they,88550_2.txt
were on their way overland to Corsicana,88550_2.txt
Henderson reached here at an early,88550_2.txt
"hours this morning, and when he learned",88550_2.txt
that he was to be executed by the mob,88550_2.txt
made a full confession. He told how,88550_2.txt
Mrs. Younger had bravely resisted the assault,88550_2.txt
and in his frenzy he butchered her,88550_2.txt
before the eyes of her little girl. In the,88550_2.txt
meantime runners were sent to all parts,88550_2.txt
of Navarro County to notify the people,88550_2.txt
that Henderson had been brought to the,88550_2.txt
scene of his crime and that he would be,88550_2.txt
executed during the day.,88550_2.txt

"city, and at 10:30 o'clock the streets were",88550_2.txt
swarming with a surging mass.,88550_2.txt
It was given out that the negro would,88550_2.txt
"be burned alive at 2 o'clock, but a rumor",88550_2.txt
became current that a sheriff's posse was,88550_2.txt
"being organized to rescue the prisoner,",88550_2.txt
and the changed its plans and announced,88550_2.txt
mob that the execution would take,88550_2.txt
place immediately. A railroad rall was,88550_2.txt
sunk into the ground in the middle of,88550_2.txt
the courthouse yard and the shivering,88550_2.txt
"wretch, heavily chained, was brought",88550_2.txt
"forward, followed by a clamorous crowd",88550_2.txt
of 4000 people. The negro was securely,88550_2.txt
chained to the fron stake and heaps of,88550_2.txt
wood were piled about him. Then quantities,88550_2.txt
of kerosene were poured on the,88550_2.txt
doomed man.,88550_2.txt

only slashed the chained negro's face.,88550_2.txt
Henderson's struggles were fearful and,88550_2.txt
his screams were drowned by the yells,88550_2.txt
of the frenzied mob. After ten minutes,88550_2.txt

a mob would take the negroes and lynch,88554_0.txt
them.,88554_0.txt
Sheriff Austin and Solictor Proctor were,88554_0.txt

instructed the officer that had the ne-,88554_0.txt

officer brought them to Scottsboro. About,88554_0.txt
fifty men were closing around them as,88554_0.txt
they were hustled aboard the train at,88554_0.txt
Stevenson. The sheriff took charge of,88554_0.txt
the negroes and put them in jail at once,88554_0.txt
and heavily armed the guards on duty.,88554_0.txt
Sheriff Austin and Sollctor Proctor went,88554_0.txt
to Stevenson this morning to investigate,88554_0.txt
more fully. Considerable indignation is,88554_0.txt

ALABAMA HANDLING LYNCHERS.,88555_0.txt
From the Jacksonville Times- Union.,88555_0.txt
Alabama is making a record which we,88555_0.txt
hope to soon see the other Southern,88555_0.txt
States imitate. A few days ago a sheriff,88555_0.txt
saved his prisoner from a mob at the risk,88555_0.txt
of his own life. Our dispatches published,88555_0.txt
yesterday chronicled a battle of the,88555_0.txt
officers in defense of a prisoner against a,88555_0.txt
"mob attempting to lynch him, in which",88555_0.txt
the mob was driven off and one of its,88555_0.txt
"leaders was killed and another wounded,",88555_0.txt
and this morning we publish the news,88555_0.txt
that ten indictments have been found,88555_0.txt
If,88555_0.txt

"this should continue, lynch law will be",88555_0.txt
Alabama.,88555_0.txt
come of infrequent use in,88555_0.txt
Lynch law has failed to suppress crime.,88555_0.txt
If for no other reason the laws of the,88555_0.txt
land should be given a chance.,88555_0.txt
It is a fact worthy of note that in no,88555_0.txt
contest between the officers of the law,88555_0.txt
and mobs have the former been worsted.,88555_0.txt
If experience up to date proves anything,88555_0.txt
it proves that sheriffs can defend their,88555_0.txt
prisoners if they will. They are sworn,88555_0.txt
to discharge their duties and they should,88555_0.txt
"observe their oaths, however heinous the",88555_0.txt
crime of the prisoners may be.,88555_0.txt
A constitutional convention is now sit,88555_0.txt
ting in Alabama called principally for the,88555_0.txt
purpose of decreasing the negro's influence,88555_0.txt
in politics.,88555_0.txt
Measures were pro,88555_0.txt
posed before that convention looking to,88555_0.txt
the suppression of lynching. In discussing,88555_0.txt
these measures it was proposed that as,88555_0.txt
the political power of the negro was to,88555_0.txt
be reduced he should be given greater,88555_0.txt
protection. The officials of the State,88555_0.txt
seem to have caught the spirit of this,88555_0.txt
proposition and to be acting on it.,88555_0.txt
It is very rare that men have been,88555_0.txt
"lynched who did not deserve death, but",88555_0.txt
cases have been known where mistakes,88555_0.txt
have been discovered too late for their,88555_0.txt
rectification. It is getting to be not in,88555_0.txt
frequent that men are lynched for,88555_0.txt
"offenses certainly not the most helnous,",88555_0.txt
and unless the officials do their duty,88555_0.txt
lynchings for trivial offenses will become,88555_0.txt
more common. We congratulate our,88555_0.txt
neighbor on the progress she is making in,88555_0.txt
"her work for law and order, and predict",88555_0.txt
great results from what has already,88555_0.txt

no excuse whatever for any interference,88555_2.txt

deplorable and humiliating affair. It is,88619_0.txt
difficult to know how to meet these dreadful,88619_0.txt
displays of lawlessness and cruelty.,88619_0.txt
It is a sad fact that a large part of the,88619_0.txt
communities have lost confidence in the,88619_0.txt
actions of the courts- not that they have,88619_0.txt
"lost confidence in the judges, but they",88619_0.txt
think trickery prevails by which criminals,88619_0.txt

an argument for the advocates of,88619_0.txt
"mob law, this is but a repetition of the",88619_0.txt
old and threadbare excuse that lynchers.,88619_0.txt
make for taking the law into their own,88619_0.txt
hands and usurping the functions of the,88619_0.txt
courts.,88619_0.txt
There is no use whatever in discussing,88619_0.txt
"any question upon incorrect premises, or",88619_0.txt
"upon a false assumption of the facts, the",88619_0.txt
object is worthy of a careful and candid,88619_0.txt
statement and examination.,88619_0.txt
The class of criminals that are lynched,88619_0.txt
"by the mob in this State, with a few rare",88619_0.txt
"exceptions, are negroes who are charged",88619_0.txt
with some crime against a white person.,88619_0.txt
Negroes are not lynched for crimes,88619_0.txt
"against individuals of their own race, and",88619_0.txt
all issues between negroes are permitted,88619_0.txt
by the mob to be settled in the courts.,88619_0.txt
It is not true that negroes who commit,88619_0.txt
crimes against white people are set free,88619_0.txt
through trickery by the courts. On the,88619_0.txt
"contrary, it is a well known fact that",88619_0.txt
will be attested by every,88619_0.txt
"lawyer, as well as by every experienced intelligent",88619_0.txt
and well informed person in the State,88619_0.txt
that a negro who is proved guilty of a,88619_0.txt
crime against a white person never es,88619_0.txt
conviction in the courts. The,88619_0.txt
capes,88619_0.txt
juries stand ready to convict if the evidence,88619_0.txt
"warrants conviction, and invariably",88619_0.txt
"convict in all such cases,",88619_0.txt
Nothing can be more misleading there,88619_0.txt
fore than the suggestion that the mob.,88619_0.txt
supplements some deficiency in the machinery,88619_0.txt
"of the law, for the mob invariably",88619_0.txt
and uniformly hangs the only class of,88619_0.txt
criminals who are always convicted and,88619_0.txt
punished promptly by the courts of the,88619_0.txt
State.,88619_0.txt
On the other hand it is interesting and,88619_0.txt
instructive to observe the significant fact,88619_0.txt
that the mob never touches the only class,88619_0.txt
of criminals that escape the clutches of,88619_0.txt

only class of criminals who escape punishment,88619_0.txt

singular the,88619_0.txt
as it from,88619_0.txt
"may appear,",88619_0.txt
arguments of the advocates of mob law it,88619_0.txt
never occurs to the mob to lynch these,88619_0.txt
red- handed offenders against the law.,88619_0.txt

he enjoys an immunity not only from the,88619_0.txt
"law and the courts, but from the mob as",88619_0.txt
well.,88619_0.txt
A strange and extraordinary inconsistency,88619_0.txt
is the spectacle of a virtuously in-:,88619_0.txt
dignant mob lynching the class of criminals,88619_0.txt

that large class of homicides who escape,88619_0.txt
"the meshes of the law, and whose bloody",88619_0.txt
crimes go unpunished.,88619_0.txt
The argument for the mob is all non,88619_0.txt
sense and rubbish. It ought not to impose,88619_0.txt

He swore in extra deputies and,88683_0.txt

atrocity of the crime charged,88683_0.txt
against the negro.,88683_0.txt
By dark the streets in the vicinity,88683_0.txt
of the courthouse were blocked,88683_0.txt
for several squares. Chief of Police,88683_0.txt
Eberstein mounted a box and,88683_0.txt
attempted to address the crowd.,88683_0.txt
but was unable to make himself,88683_0.txt
"heard, and only with difficulty",88683_0.txt
made his own escape. It was at,88683_0.txt

breaking windows in the courthouse,88683_0.txt
and shortly afterwards the,88683_0.txt

", the lynching was over and",88683_0.txt
the crowd beginning to disperse,88683_0.txt

the city. For hours it was not,88683_0.txt
known whether Sheriff Clarke and.,88683_0.txt

' There was no way to get word in,88683_0.txt

heard above the shouts and cries,88683_0.txt
of the mob.,88683_0.txt
Sheriff Clark is believed to have,88683_0.txt
surrendered Brown only when the,88683_0.txt
threat of death to his deputies became,88683_0.txt
too menacing. With the dispersal,88683_0.txt
of the mob after the lynching,88683_0.txt
firemen were able to get water,88683_0.txt
"on the flames, which, it was reported",88683_0.txt
", were checked at the fourth",88683_0.txt
"floor, one story below the jail.",88683_0.txt
The original members of the niob,88683_0.txt
"were augmented by hundreds of others,",88683_0.txt
apparently equally determined to,88683_0.txt
lynch Brown They yelled for their,88683_0.txt
prisoners and attempted to get into,88683_0.txt
the courthouse. The few police officers,88683_0.txt
who had arrived were able to,88683_0.txt
keep them from breaking in the doors,88683_0.txt
for only a short while. A negro officer,88683_0.txt
was among those to report for,88683_0.txt
"duty at the courthouse, but his presence",88683_0.txt
cnly angered the crowd. He was,88683_0.txt
"the first victim of violence, being",88683_0.txt
badly beaten,88683_0.txt
The sheriff. then coupled up three,88683_0.txt
lines of interior fire hose and with,88683_0.txt
his deputies and some police officers,88683_0.txt
attemtped to disperse the crowd by,88683_0.txt
turning the water on them. Instead,88683_0.txt
of having a quieting effect it brought,88683_0.txt
a hail of stones and bricks. In 10,88683_0.txt
minutes 50 windows had been broken,88683_0.txt
on the south side of the courthouse and,88683_0.txt
much other damage done. From that,88683_0.txt
time on until the negro was strung up,88683_0.txt
to the pole the vicinity for,88683_0.txt
many,88683_0.txt

"A small crowd of young men, none",88683_0.txt

"then secured a rope, which they threw",88683_0.txt
over the ledge of a second- story window,88683_0.txt
. One of their number mounted,88683_0.txt
the rope to the window. From there,88683_0.txt
he pulled up a ladder that had been,88683_0.txt
provided and a score or more of his,88683_0.txt
companions followed. Once inside the,88683_0.txt
"building, they were followed by many",88683_0.txt
"more, who began working their way",88683_0.txt
shots were fired.,88683_0.txt
The sheriff's office is on the fourth.,88683_0.txt
"floor, facing north on Farnam street.",88683_0.txt
and from the rear of his office is a,88683_0.txt

that there was a possibility of,88711_0.txt

who were prominent in the mob of last,88711_1.txt
"Thursday night have left the city, and",88711_1.txt
that others are in hiding. The true bills,88711_1.txt

Tonight several crowds gathered on the,88711_1.txt

but they were actuated more by curiosity,88711_1.txt
than by any desire to liberate the prisoner,88711_1.txt

Captain Brown at once notified them,88711_1.txt
in a quiet manner that they would not,88711_1.txt
"be allowed to congregate, and dispersed",88711_1.txt
them before more than twenty could collect,88711_1.txt

that the prisoners can live in it without,88711_1.txt
trouble. The company is camped around,88711_1.txt
"the jail, and it is expected that it will",88711_1.txt
"be several days, probably a week, before",88711_1.txt
they can leave. The troops are to,88711_1.txt
prevent any mob violence and to keep,88711_1.txt
in safety the prisoners who are arrested,88711_1.txt
or may be arrested.,88711_1.txt
In Command of Situation.,88711_1.txt
Judge Speake tonight gave Captain,88711_1.txt
Brown an official order placing him in,88711_1.txt
command of the situation and instructing,88711_1.txt
him to take every step necessary to prevent,88711_1.txt
any attempt at rescue. He instructs,88711_1.txt
Captain Brown to use his own,88711_1.txt
discretion in carrying out the orders of,88711_1.txt
himself and also those of Governor Cun-,88711_1.txt
ningham. The order of Judge Speake is,88711_1.txt
similar to that of Governor Cunningham,88711_1.txt
with the exception that it is written and,88711_1.txt
the governor's was oral.,88711_1.txt
Later tonight several small crowds,88711_1.txt
gathered in the city several blocks from,88711_1.txt
"the county jail, and were discussing the",88711_1.txt
arrival of the company and the arrests.,88711_1.txt
Captain Brown sent out a patrol to prevent,88711_1.txt

patrol will be out as long as there are,88711_1.txt
any people on the streets.,88711_1.txt
"While not officially confirmed, it is understood",88711_1.txt
that the indictments of the,88711_1.txt
grand jury include two or three men,88711_1.txt
"who are rather prominent in the city, or",88711_1.txt
the surrounding suburbs. The others are,88711_1.txt
for men less prominent. If there is any,88711_1.txt
trouble or attempt to rescue prisoners.,88711_1.txt

by Captain Brown and removed to the,88711_1.txt

This was done to prevent any possibility,88711_1.txt
of the crowd getting hold of them in,88711_1.txt
case of a riot.,88711_1.txt
Captain Brown announced tonight that,88711_1.txt
he would not hesitate to give the order,88711_1.txt
to fire if there was any attempt to rescue,88711_1.txt
"the prisoners, and that no one must even",88711_1.txt

It has been announced here that there,88711_1.txt

against Sheriff Rodgers or Mayor Smith,88711_1.txt
in connection with the riot. The report,88711_1.txt

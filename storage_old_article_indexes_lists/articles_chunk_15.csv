The Atrocity Likely to Involve the,87891_0.txt
Country in Serious Trouble,87891_0.txt
With Italy.,87891_0.txt
"Washington, Aug. 9.- The state department",87891_0.txt
has received from the Ital-,87891_0.txt
ian authorities a copy of the complete,87891_0.txt
"report made by Marquis Romano, secretary",87891_0.txt

lynching of five Italians at,87891_0.txt
"lah, La. Talu-",87891_0.txt
In a Serious Light.,87891_1.txt
The report presents the affair in a,87891_1.txt
serious light. As a whole the Italian,87891_1.txt
authorities view the matter,87891_1.txt
of the,87891_1.txt
lynching as one of unusual atrocity,87891_1.txt
and without the mitigating circumstances,87891_1.txt
which had been urged in previous,87891_1.txt
affairs of this kind.,87891_1.txt
Dr. Hodges Was the Aggressor.,87891_1.txt
"In describing the first affray, which",87891_1.txt
"led up to the lynching, Marquis Ro-",87891_1.txt
mano's report states that Dr. Hodges,87891_1.txt
"was the first to draw his weapon, and",87891_1.txt
that not until he had fired one shot,87891_1.txt
and was about to fire the second one,87891_1.txt
"at Charles Difata, who was at the time",87891_1.txt
"Prostrate on the ground, did the brother",87891_1.txt
", Joe Difata, fire his shotgun from",87891_1.txt
"the store near by. This last shot, it is",87891_1.txt
"pointed out, was in defense of the",87891_1.txt
"fallen brother, and was not a",87891_1.txt
attack upon Dr. Hodges. wanton,87891_1.txt
The Beginning of the Affray.,87891_2.txt
The circumstances leading up to the,87891_2.txt
affray are described in detail. According,87891_2.txt
to this account Charles Difata was,87891_2.txt
alone when Dr. Hodges passed. There,87891_2.txt
is no effort made in the report to obscure,87891_2.txt
the fact that Charles Difata,87891_2.txt
made the first offensive overture. But,87891_2.txt
it is contended that this was not accompanied,87891_2.txt
by the use of firearms or,87891_2.txt
even a movement to draw them. It is,87891_2.txt
"said, however, that Charles Difata upbraided",87891_2.txt
Dr. Hodges in an offensive way,87891_2.txt
for having killed an animal and accompanied,87891_2.txt
this by a blow of the fist.,87891_2.txt
"Then, it is stated, Dr. Hodges shot at",87891_2.txt
Difata. Whether or not the shot took,87891_2.txt
effect it was not possible for the Ital-,87891_2.txt
"ian authorities to learn, as the bodies",87891_2.txt
"of the men, after being lynched, were",87891_2.txt
disfigured and disposed of. But at all,87891_2.txt
events it is stated that Charles Difata,87891_2.txt
was on the ground following the shot,87891_2.txt
from Dr. Hodge's weapon. At this,87891_2.txt
point Joe Difata made his appearance,87891_2.txt
and seeing his brother down and a,87891_2.txt
"second shot about to be fired, shot",87891_2.txt
Dr. Hodges. at,87891_2.txt
The First Lynchings.,87891_3.txt
Then followed the lynching of these,87891_3.txt
"two Italians, Joe Difata and Charles",87891_3.txt
Difata. The mob took them before,87891_3.txt
they had been arrested.,87891_3.txt

had figured in the only affair.,87891_3.txt

Three More Lynchings.,87891_4.txt
The report then brings out the fact,87891_4.txt
"that the mob, having already lynched",87891_4.txt
"Charles and Joe Difata, turned their",87891_4.txt
attention to the three Italians under,87891_4.txt
"arrest. Two of these men, Joseph Fe-",87891_4.txt
"ducio and Frank Difata, were first",87891_4.txt
taken from the officers and lynched.,87891_4.txt

About one week before the above,88095_1.txt
occurrence this man Nelson had some,88095_1.txt
difficulty with an old negro named,88095_1.txt
"an Betts, who lived near Varner, about",88095_1.txt
some rents. Betts went to Nelson's,88095_1.txt
house to settle up the matter about,88095_1.txt
some rents due Betts' mother- in- law,88095_1.txt
which they claimed Nelson had received,88095_1.txt
from a man named Hill with,88095_1.txt
instructions that the money be turned,88095_1.txt
off over to the women. Nelson denied,88095_1.txt
having received the money. This,88095_1.txt
at brought about a quarrell and without,88095_1.txt
any warning Nelson suddenly,88095_1.txt
drew an ax struck old man Betts a,88095_1.txt
blow and severed his right leg from,88095_1.txt
his body. The old man fell prostrate,88095_1.txt
to the ground and his assailant jumped,88095_1.txt
on him with both feet and stamped,88095_1.txt
him to death. Nelson was arrested,88095_1.txt
and placed in jail at Varnar. On,88095_1.txt
the night of the 13th of November,88095_1.txt
- last the aboved named negroes indicted,88095_1.txt
for murder went to the jail at,88095_1.txt
"Varnar, broke it open got possession",88095_1.txt
of Nelson and completly riddled his,88095_1.txt
body with bullets and afterwards,88095_1.txt
tried to set it on fire. The officers at,88095_1.txt

the same time the first man to maintain,88172_0.txt
and to vindicate with his life the,88172_0.txt
right of the American press to publish,88172_0.txt
honest opinion upon any chosen subject,88172_0.txt

"Lovejoy was born at Albion, Kenebec",88172_0.txt
"county, Maine, November 9, 1802. He",88172_0.txt
"entered Wallville college at 21, and",88172_0.txt
graduated four years later with the,88172_0.txt
first honors of his class. He then came,88172_0.txt
"west to St. Louis, and began teaching",88172_0.txt
"in the public schools, but soon gave",88172_0.txt
that up to become the editor of the St.,88172_0.txt
"Louis Times, fighting his first campaign",88172_0.txt
in behalf of the election of Henry Clay,88172_0.txt
to the presidency. About the close of,88172_0.txt
that campaign he joined the Presbyterian,88172_0.txt
church and soon afterward concluded,88172_0.txt
to enter the ministry. Accordingly,88172_0.txt
", in 1832 he began studying at Prince-",88172_0.txt
"ton Theological seminary, being licensed",88172_0.txt
to preach the gospel one year,88172_0.txt
later.,88172_0.txt
"He held two charges, at Newport, R.",88172_0.txt
"I., and Spring church, N. Y., but although",88172_0.txt
"he was a powerful preacher, he",88172_0.txt
was not destined to do his great work,88172_0.txt
in the pulpit. He again returned to St.,88172_0.txt
Louis and established the St. Louis Observer,88172_0.txt
", the first issue of which appeared",88172_0.txt
"November 22, 1833. It was essentially",88172_0.txt
"a religious newspaper, but the editor",88172_0.txt
could not keep down his intense love of,88172_0.txt
liberty and his convictions in regard to,88172_0.txt
the slavery question. It was impossible,88172_0.txt
for him not soon to become involved in,88172_0.txt
"the discussion of the subject, and one",88172_0.txt
day he wrote an editorial setting forth,88172_0.txt
"his opinions so strongly, that when it",88172_0.txt
appeared the community was thrown,88172_0.txt
at once into a furore of excitement. He,88172_0.txt
was away at a synodical meeting when,88172_0.txt
"it was printed, and the owners of the",88172_0.txt
press and property he occupied were,88172_0.txt
compelled to hastily print a card explaining,88172_0.txt
"it away, to prevent mob violence",88172_0.txt
. On his return he was confronted,88172_0.txt
with a paper signed by the most influential,88172_0.txt
"papers, including the minister of",88172_0.txt
"his church, setting forth the opinion",88172_0.txt
that slavery was divinely sanctioned,88172_0.txt
him to desist from his,88172_0.txt
and asking,88172_0.txt
course.,88172_0.txt
Lovejoy printed the paper with all,88172_0.txt
signatures and appended his reply. The,88172_0.txt
gist of the letter was that the editor,88172_0.txt
claimed the right to publish his honest,88172_0.txt
"convictions on any subject, and answering",88172_0.txt
the plea of Bibilical justification,88172_0.txt
", he said:",88172_0.txt
""" Make not slaves of others if you",88172_0.txt
would not be made slaves of yourselves,88172_0.txt
".""",88172_0.txt
His statements were couched in the,88172_0.txt
"most inoffensive language, but nevertheless",88172_0.txt
again stirred the ire of the citizens,88172_0.txt
.,88172_0.txt
Things went on in this way until his,88172_0.txt
presses were taken away by the owners,88172_0.txt
. but a few who sided with him,88172_0.txt
got them restored on condition that he,88172_0.txt
"would come to Illinois, where his utterances",88172_0.txt
might be safely circulated. He,88172_0.txt
"made the change, but the St. Louis people",88172_0.txt
then relented and called him back.,88172_0.txt
"It happened, however, that a negro,",88172_0.txt
"arrested for a crime, assaulted the officers",88172_0.txt
and killed one of them. A mob,88172_0.txt
soon after took him from the jail and,88172_0.txt
burned him at the stake. When the,88172_0.txt
trial of some of the ringleaders in this,88172_0.txt
"act came up, the judge dismissed them",88172_0.txt
on the ground that the negro had been,88172_0.txt
incited to his act by reading the Observer,88172_0.txt
", and that there was no law to",88172_0.txt
punish them.,88172_0.txt
This was too much. Lovejoy published,88172_0.txt
an editorial reply so scathing in its,88172_0.txt
criticism that he knew violence must,88172_0.txt
"follow, and at once shipped his plant to",88172_0.txt
"Alton. He arrived here on Sunday, July",88172_0.txt
"21, 1836. He left it in the warehouse",88172_0.txt
"over night, and before daylight it was",88172_0.txt
destroyed by a mob. This at once,88172_0.txt
transferred the trouble to Illinois. A,88172_0.txt
meeting was held next night in the,88172_0.txt
"Presbyterian church, where the editor",88172_0.txt
"made an address, stating that he had",88172_0.txt
come to Alton in good faith to publish a,88172_0.txt
religious newspaper; that his object,88172_0.txt
evidently been misunderstood;,88172_0.txt
had,88172_0.txt
"that he was not an abolitionist, but was",88172_0.txt
honestly opposed to slavery. He also,88172_0.txt
said that having removed from the seat,88172_0.txt
"of slavery, he need not now continue to",88172_0.txt
"fight it,"" that it would be cowardice to",88172_0.txt
fly from a slave state to attack its,88172_0.txt
"methods from free soil.""",88172_0.txt
"He was sincere in this profession, and",88172_0.txt
thus mollified public opinion so that,88172_0.txt
"funds were soon raised, and on Sep-",88172_0.txt
"tember 8, 1836, he printed the first number",88172_0.txt
of the Alton Observer. The vigorous,88172_0.txt
power of editorial utterances,88172_0.txt
"soon made the publication its famous, and",88172_0.txt
all went well until the slave question,88172_0.txt
came up again in earnest. Mr. Love-,88172_0.txt
joy was still smarting under the check,88172_0.txt
"placed upon him, and determined once",88172_0.txt
for all to assert and maintain his constitutional,88172_0.txt
rights.,88172_0.txt
"In June, 1837, he began agitating the",88172_0.txt
formation of a national anti- slavery so-,88172_0.txt
"tiety, and on the following Fourth of",88172_0.txt
July he printed these burning reflections,88172_0.txt
upon the observance of the day:,88172_0.txt

of manly indignation the attempt of,88172_0.txt

which neither they nor their children,88172_0.txt
"could bear. Alas, what bitter mockery",88172_0.txt

by slaves on a soil moistened,88172_0.txt
with their blood drawn from them by,88172_0.txt
"the whip of a Republican taskmaster.""",88172_0.txt
No sooner was this read than the,88172_0.txt
men of the city held a meeting in the,88172_0.txt
"market house, and with strange inconsistency",88172_0.txt
claimed the right to free,88172_0.txt
"speech for themselves, while plotting to",88172_0.txt
deprive another of that same privilege.,88172_0.txt
A committee was appointed to request,88172_0.txt
Lovejoy to cease agitating slavery matters,88172_0.txt
". The latter, fearing to meet him",88172_0.txt
"face to face, sent him a letter to this",88172_0.txt
effect. He replied by denying their,88172_0.txt
right to dictate to him what he should,88172_0.txt
"discuss, and tendered them at the",88172_0.txt
same time the use of his paper to refute,88172_0.txt
his arguments if they were incorrect.,88172_0.txt
But the malcontents chose a more summary,88172_0.txt
course. On the night of August,88172_0.txt
"25 a mob attacked the Observer office,",88172_0.txt
and after driving out the employes,88172_0.txt
completely demolished the press.,88172_0.txt
"The act was boldly committed, but no",88172_0.txt
attempt at punishment followed. The,88172_0.txt
"anti- slavery citizens, deeply incensed",88172_0.txt
"as they were, had no choice but to submit",88172_0.txt
", and quietly sent for a new press.",88172_0.txt
"This arrived in due time, but Lovejoy",88172_0.txt
"was away at the time, and on the night",88172_0.txt
of its arrival it was taken from the,88172_0.txt
house and thrown into the Mississippi.,88172_0.txt
Then several public meetings were,88172_0.txt
"held, the objects of which were to affect",88172_0.txt

conclusion that the friends of liberty,88172_0.txt

I have sworn eternal opposition,88172_0.txt

Thus the brave reformer defied his,88172_0.txt
"fate, and when the fourth press arrived",88172_0.txt
"early in the morning of November 7,",88172_0.txt
"by steamer, it was evident that a crisis",88172_0.txt
was at hand. It was stored in the stone,88172_0.txt
warehouse of Godfrey& Gilman. That,88172_0.txt
night a drunken mob demanded the,88172_0.txt
"press. It being refused, an attack was",88172_0.txt
made on the building. The defenders,88172_0.txt
"fired upon the mob, killing one and",88172_0.txt
wounding several men This cleared,88172_0.txt
the square for a time; but. soon the at-,88172_0.txt
tack was renewed. Another volley,88172_0.txt
caused a second retreat. The place,88172_0.txt
seemed deserted. The defenders supposed,88172_0.txt
they had been victorious; a few,88172_0.txt
"of them, with Lovejoy, stepped outside,",88172_0.txt
and in to the trap laid. A dozen assassins,88172_0.txt
fired upon the editor from some,88172_0.txt
"piles of cordwood, and with the words,",88172_0.txt
""" My God, I am shot,"" he expired with",88172_0.txt
five bullets in his body.,88172_0.txt
After this the anti- slavery troubles,88172_0.txt
ceased in Alton. The Observer was,88172_0.txt
never revived and the incident passed,88172_0.txt
into history. But it seemed to have,88172_0.txt
left a blight upon the city. Up to that,88172_0.txt
time Alton promised to become the metropolis,88172_0.txt
of the Mississippi valley. It,88172_0.txt
was larger as it was also older than St.,88172_0.txt
"Louis, and was the head of navigation",88172_0.txt
on the Mississippi. But with Lovejoy's,88172_0.txt
death a period of retrogression set in,88172_0.txt
"that lasted 20 years, and it is only within",88172_0.txt
the past decade that the old and,88172_0.txt
beautiful bluff city has fully recovered,88172_0.txt
from the ban of that terrible experience,88172_0.txt

A DASTARDLY DEED.,88237_0.txt
One of the most dastardly deeds,88237_0.txt
ever committed in the criminal annals,88237_0.txt
of Arkansas took place at Mc,88237_0.txt
morning at 3,88237_0.txt
Gehee last Monday,88237_0.txt
o'clock when Sam Fleming was taken,88237_0.txt
from a calaboose and lynched. The,88237_0.txt
negro had committed no crime de,88237_0.txt
serving such a penalty. On Sunday,88237_0.txt
"afternoon, it is related, Fleming and",88237_0.txt
a white saloon keeper named Vaughn,88237_0.txt
involved a difficulty in,88237_0.txt
became in,88237_0.txt
worsted.,88237_0.txt
which the white man was,88237_0.txt
Fleming was arrested on the charge,88237_0.txt
of disturbing the peace and placed,88237_0.txt
in the calaboose. Monday morning,88237_0.txt
when the officers went for Fleming,88237_0.txt
they found the door of the calaboose,88237_0.txt
had been removed and the prisoner,88237_0.txt
A search revealed the fact,88237_0.txt
was gone.,88237_0.txt
that Fleming's body was dangling,88237_0.txt
from the limb of a tree. So quietly,88237_0.txt
"was it done, says the report, that not",88237_0.txt
even the girl in the telephone office,88237_0.txt
just across the street from where,88237_0.txt
"the negro was"" lynched"" knew of the",88237_0.txt
incident.,88237_0.txt
From the foregoing it will be seen,88237_0.txt
that Fleming was guilty of no great,88237_0.txt
"er offense than a breach of the peace,",88237_0.txt
"therefore, even if guilty, he could only",88237_0.txt
be fined under the law. He had committed,88237_0.txt
no felony; he had not com,88237_0.txt
crime for,88237_0.txt
mitted the unspeakable,88237_0.txt
which the punishment in the South is,88237_0.txt
death. He had only disturbed the,88237_0.txt
"peace and hipped a white man, apparently",88237_0.txt
"no better than himself, and",88237_0.txt
"for this he was"" lynched.""",88237_0.txt
The affair does not partake of the,88237_0.txt
"dignity of a"" lynching."" In the opinion",88237_0.txt
of the Graphic lynch- law is,88237_0.txt
But this was,88237_0.txt
sometimes justifiable.,88237_0.txt
"murder- cold blooded, unprovoked",88237_0.txt
and premeditated murder and the,88237_0.txt
parties guilty of it are murderers.,88237_0.txt
From the evidence at hand the deed,88237_0.txt
"was the work of a few men, actuated",88237_0.txt
purely by motives of revenge and,88237_0.txt
murder. It was a dastardly deed,88237_0.txt
that reflects upon the cilivization of,88237_0.txt
our State. It is such things as this,88237_0.txt
that bring the South into disrepute.,88237_0.txt
and causes our civilization and laws,88237_0.txt
oftentimes to become a by- word and,88237_0.txt
a reproach. As the Graphic has,88237_0.txt
remarked. lynching is,88237_0.txt
previously,88237_0.txt
"murder,",88237_0.txt
"sometimes justifiable, but",88237_0.txt
never! The officers of Desha county,88237_0.txt
"should therefore be up and doing, and",88237_0.txt
endeavor to ferret out these criminals,88237_0.txt
. They doubtless would not be,88237_0.txt
very difficult to discover. Such a,88237_0.txt
serious and unprovoked outrage upon,88237_0.txt
the laws of Arkansas should not be,88237_0.txt
permitted to go unpunished. Let the,88237_0.txt

LYNCHING.,88241_0.txt
Reference was made in these columns,88241_0.txt
a few days ago to the encouraging,88241_0.txt
decrease in the number of,88241_0.txt
"lynchings, as shown by the statist: es",88241_0.txt
for 1907. The decrease is in itself,88241_0.txt
cause for congratulation. But a,88241_0.txt
a,88241_0.txt
more careful examinat on of the tabulated,88241_0.txt
statement reveals some facts,88241_0.txt
that should bring us to serious,88241_0.txt
thought. It appears that the crime,88241_0.txt
usually associated with lynching in,88241_0.txt
the public mind had comparatively,88241_0.txt
small place among the causes of this,88241_0.txt
type of lawlessness in the last year.,88241_0.txt
If the statement from which we get,88241_0.txt
"information be correct, many lynchings",88241_0.txt
were not the result of rape;,88241_0.txt
some were for such comparatively,88241_0.txt
trivial things as non- payment of,88241_0.txt
debt and fighting. And at least two,88241_0.txt
"persons, one of whom was a woman,",88241_0.txt
were lynched for no other reason,88241_0.txt
than they were related to the,88241_0.txt
real criminal that.,88241_0.txt
It is useless to repeat here the,88241_1.txt
opinions so often given as to methods,88241_1.txt
of preventing such dangerous,88241_1.txt
and humiliating occurrences. But,88241_1.txt
it might be worth while to call attention,88241_1.txt
to the fact that the casual,88241_1.txt
expressions of opinion by men who,88241_1.txt
have not been and would not be in,88241_1.txt
"such mobs, have much to do with these",88241_1.txt
things. One frequently hears good,88241_1.txt
law- abiding men excuse lynching on,88241_1.txt
the ground that it is the result of,88241_1.txt
Southerners' determination to,88241_1.txt
the,88241_1.txt
avenge the wrong of their women.,88241_1.txt

assault was made. The miscreant evidently,88268_1.txt
slipped up behind her and,88268_1.txt
dealt a fearful blow over the head,88268_1.txt
with the limb of a tree as large as a,88268_1.txt

"throw into the water, but it was found",88268_1.txt
next day in some vines. It was clotted,88268_1.txt
with blood.,88268_1.txt

then by a low gurgling groan coming,88268_1.txt
from the canes.,88268_1.txt
"Her skull was crushed in, jawbones",88268_1.txt

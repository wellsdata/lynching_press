When some seven years ago a negro,17777_0.txt
"was burned at Paris, Tex., the whole",17777_0.txt

There were twenty- five or thirty soldiers,17796_1.txt
dressed in uniform and carrying guns with,17796_1.txt

room. He had gone down stairs in the,17796_1.txt

At day this morning Drummond's body,17796_1.txt
was found hanging from a railroad trestle,17796_1.txt
a few hundred yards from where he was,17796_1.txt
arrested. The motive for lynching him was,17796_1.txt

THE LEAVENWORTH HORROR.,17812_0.txt

indefensible. Even though it were ad,17812_0.txt
Alexander guilty of,17812_0.txt
mitted that was,17812_0.txt
the crimes of which he was suspected,17812_0.txt
still the outrage can not be palliated;,17812_0.txt
that Alexander asserted his innocence of,17812_0.txt
the murder in the face of certain death,17812_0.txt
adds to the horror of the case.,17812_0.txt
People goaded to frenzy by outrages,17812_0.txt
upon their homes sometimes commit acts,17812_0.txt
which their sober second judgment,17812_0.txt
would condemn and this is undoubtedly,17812_0.txt
true in this case. The agony of the,17812_0.txt
negro as he writhed burning at the,17812_0.txt
stake will not prevent future acts of,17812_0.txt
violence and at the same time it brutalized,17812_0.txt
every person connected with the,17812_0.txt
lynching.,17812_0.txt

scene similar to that enacted in Leaven,17812_0.txt

feeling against horse- stealing was especially,17865_0.txt
"severe, the number of executions",17865_0.txt

In 1886 the vigilantes were unusually,17865_0.txt

"again given no mercy, ten of them",17865_0.txt
paying the extreme penalty; eight,17865_0.txt
were lynched in this same year for,17865_0.txt

"and desperadoes who suffered most,",17865_0.txt
nineteen of them being strung up by,17865_0.txt
mobs. In 1890 race prejudice claimed,17865_0.txt
five victims and political prejudice,17865_0.txt
three. The most sensational feature,17865_0.txt
of 1891 was the summary execution of,17865_0.txt
eleven Italians in New Orleans for alleged,17865_0.txt
conspiracy to murder. In 1892,17865_0.txt
the crime of horse- stealing cost twenty,17865_0.txt
more men their lives. In 1893 the,17865_0.txt
"whitecaps began operations, lynchinglars",17865_0.txt

"tio lucing smallpox, swindling and",17865_0.txt

was lynched also a man for being dis,17865_0.txt
reputable. A counterfeiter was strung,17865_0.txt
up in 1896 also a man for slapping a,17865_0.txt
child. The whitecaps claimed four,17865_0.txt
victims in 1897 and in 1898 violation,17865_0.txt
of a contract cost one man his life.,17865_0.txt
In 1899 five men were hanged with,17865_0.txt

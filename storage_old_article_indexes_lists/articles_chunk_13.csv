yet been an effort made to rob a bank,87613_1.txt

has never been in the Chickasaw Nation,87613_1.txt

"rob a train, but once since the courts",87613_1.txt
"were established here, seven years ago,",87613_1.txt
and that took place some five or six,87613_1.txt
years ago. And there are three great,87613_1.txt

"equity, and cases involving many",87613_1.txt

"discharging their duties, or unwilling to",87613_1.txt
"discharge their duties, and that the",87613_1.txt
petit juries cannot be trusted to do,87613_1.txt

"been marked by a courage, efficiency,",87613_1.txt
energy and intelligence such as I have,87613_1.txt

"ber, at the town of Ryan, I called the",87613_1.txt
attention of the grand jury to these,87613_1.txt
widespread charges of abuses by pub,87613_1.txt
le officials. The grand jury went to,87613_1.txt
"work and indicted the officials, who",87613_1.txt
"were supposed to be influential, and",87613_1.txt
who had influential friends backing,87613_1.txt
"them, and they did so in the",87613_1.txt
midst of considerable effort to intimidate,87613_1.txt
the grand jury and deter it from,87613_1.txt

ligent in the discharge of their duties.,87613_1.txt
The first four or five months of my,87613_1.txt
service on the bench here was devoted,87613_1.txt
to the transaction of business on the,87613_1.txt
civil docket. The first important criminal,87613_1.txt
"business the court did was at Ryan,",87613_1.txt
begining the 16th of September. From,87613_1.txt
"that time up to this date, I suppose this",87613_1.txt
court has been engaged about sixty,87613_1.txt
"five days, off and on, in the transaction",87613_1.txt
of business on the criminal docket: and,87613_1.txt
during that time there has been about,87613_1.txt
"fifty- five trials for felonies, about forty",87613_1.txt
"six convictions, four acquittals and five",87613_1.txt
mistrials. The result in prosecutions,87613_1.txt
for misdemeanors has been about in the,87613_1.txt
aame proportion. And I venture to say,87613_1.txt

shot through the window at Largey. The,87668_1.txt
bullet struck the latter in the left arm,87668_1.txt
and shattered the bone. Largey stooped,87668_1.txt

to his statement that Largey refused,87668_1.txt

that the banker frequently helped him. He,87668_1.txt

THAT OWENSBORO OUTRAGE.,87679_1.txt
The lynching of the negro Holt at,87679_1.txt
Owensboro Saturday morning was,87679_1.txt
without justification or excuse.,87679_1.txt
Heretofore it has been the plea advanced,87679_1.txt
in favor of mob violence,87679_1.txt
that the of the law is,87679_1.txt
progress too,87679_1.txt
"slow and uncertain, that"" the best",87679_1.txt
"plan is the surest plan,"" etc. But in",87679_1.txt
the present instance no such excuse,87679_1.txt
was available. The trial of the prisoner,87679_1.txt
was in progress and was being,87679_1.txt
pushed with all possible celerity consistent,87679_1.txt
with a full development of,87679_1.txt
the facts. It was conceded by every,87679_1.txt
body at all conversant with the case,87679_1.txt
that the death penalty would be the,87679_1.txt
result But in interim,87679_1.txt
. the,87679_1.txt
between,87679_1.txt
the charging of the jury and their,87679_1.txt
"deliberations in the case, the prisoner",87679_1.txt
"was taken out by a"" mob"" of",87679_1.txt
less than twenty men and hanged to a,87679_1.txt
"tree, within a stone's toss of the",87679_1.txt
tribunal of justice wherein it is guaranteed,87679_1.txt
that men's lives and liberties,87679_1.txt
are guarded and preserved with all,87679_1.txt
possible caution and decrees rendered,87679_1.txt
with the clearest sense of justice.,87679_1.txt
And thus is a terrible outrage,87679_1.txt
"perpetrated upon the court, justice",87679_1.txt
has been mocked in her deliberations,87679_1.txt
and another shameful blot cast upon,87679_1.txt
the otherwise fair name of Ken.,87679_1.txt
tucky. A crime without the shadow,87679_1.txt
of an excuse. An outrage as,87679_1.txt
senseless in conception as it was,87679_1.txt
ghastly and cruel in execution.,87679_1.txt
There is some needed remedy in,87679_1.txt
in this matter of mobs- badly needed.,87679_1.txt
Since the above deplorable occurrence,87679_1.txt
it is evident that mobs do not,87679_1.txt
always rely upon slow justice and,87679_1.txt
incapable administration of the law,87679_1.txt
as an excuse for their wanton outrages,87679_1.txt
. They seem to be controlled,87679_1.txt
by an infernal spirit of murder that,87679_1.txt
brooks no reason or restraint. The,87679_1.txt
fact that the object of their vengeance,87679_1.txt
is surely receiving the just,87679_1.txt
merits for his crime does not influence,87679_1.txt
their ideas of justice nor check their,87679_1.txt
wild haste to murder a helpless pris-,87679_1.txt
one.,87679_1.txt
The question of a remedy for,87679_1.txt
these deplorable occurrences should,87679_1.txt
be paramount to all others until an,87679_1.txt
effective law is passed that will stop,87679_1.txt
their bold progress. This law should,87679_1.txt
not deal with the citizens of the,87679_1.txt
"county as a body, but with the perpetrators",87679_1.txt
"of the crime themselves,",87679_1.txt
who are alone responsible. The,87679_1.txt
people will hail with delight the,87679_1.txt

against some of the officials and further,87826_0.txt
complications are apprehended. While the,87826_0.txt
the past two nights and days witnessed,87826_0.txt
scenes of lawlessness and blood- shed yet,87826_0.txt
the feeling at no time has been as intense,87826_0.txt
as it is here to- night. The body,87826_0.txt
of Mitchell was exposed all day in a,87826_0.txt
rough coffin and it intensified the feeling,87826_0.txt

One week ago to- day Mrs. Gaumer,87826_0.txt
"assaulted, in day light, at",87826_0.txt
was criminally,87826_0.txt
"her home in this city, near the court",87826_0.txt
house. Mrs. Gaumer was prostrated. She,87826_0.txt
felt the disgrace and requested her son,87826_0.txt
to announcet hat she was assaulted for,87826_0.txt
robbery. It was given out that Mitchell,87826_0.txt
attempted to force her to sign a check,87826_0.txt
for$ 500. But as Mrs. Gaumer's condition,87826_0.txt
became more sérious the facts became,87826_0.txt
known and also that the negro was,87826_0.txt
afflicted with a loathsome disease. Mitch-,87826_0.txt
"ell was first held for robbery, but on last",87826_0.txt
Wednesday he was arraigned for criminal,87826_0.txt
assault. Mrs. Gaumer was unable to,87826_0.txt
"appear in court, and the hearing was",87826_0.txt
held at her home. As Mitchell entered,87826_0.txt
her room she raised up in bed and ex-,87826_0.txt

Soon after the identification on Wed-,87826_0.txt
nesday there was talk of lynching.,87826_0.txt
Crowds surrounded the jail that night and,87826_0.txt
the sheriff and local militia had trouble,87826_0.txt
"in protecting the prisoner. Yesterday,",87826_0.txt
a grand jury was impannelled and it soon,87826_0.txt
returned an indictment for criminal assault,87826_0.txt
". Mitchell, disguised in a soldier's",87826_0.txt
"uniform, was brought last night from jail",87826_0.txt
into court. He waived the reading of the,87826_0.txt
"indictment, plead giulty and was prompt-",87826_0.txt
sentenced to twenty years in the peni-,87826_0.txt
"tiary, the limit for criminal assault.",87826_0.txt
trial was over before nine o'clock,87826_0.txt
"night, when an attempt was made to",87826_0.txt
Mitchell to Columbus on the train,87826_0.txt
p. m. But the crowds were about,87826_0.txt
urt house and jail and when the,87826_0.txt
"drove up, the crowd made a",87826_0.txt
the jail. The military drove,87826_0.txt
"back, but the crowd soon in-",87826_0.txt
"e n fury as well as numbers, so",87826_0.txt
that Sheriff McLean and the troops had,87826_0.txt
"all they could do to hold the jail, and",87826_0.txt
the trip to Columbus was given up before,87826_0.txt
the departure of the last train.,87826_0.txt
It was 1:30 a. m. when the first attack,87826_0.txt
was made on the jail. The soldiers opened,87826_0.txt
fire on the mob and twenty volleys,87826_0.txt
were poured into the advancing crowd.,87826_0.txt
Two were killed and nine wounded. The,87826_0.txt
attacking party retired but the sight of,87826_0.txt
the dead and injured infuriated them and,87826_0.txt
the crowd soon rallied.,87826_0.txt
The final attack on the jail was made,87826_0.txt
at 7 o'clock this morning. The local company,87826_0.txt
", which did the shooting, had been",87826_0.txt
on duty for two nights and a request was,87826_0.txt
sent to Governor Bushnell for reinforcements,87826_0.txt
. He ordered a company from,87826_0.txt
Springfield to the scene and they arrived,87826_0.txt
before 7 o'clock. Mayor Ganzon met the,87826_0.txt
"soldiers and sent them back to the depot,",87826_0.txt
were not wanted. The,87826_0.txt
saying that they,87826_0.txt
local company was also withdrawn from,87826_0.txt
"the jail about this time. The mob, which",87826_0.txt
had in numbers at,87826_0.txt
grown,87826_0.txt
the,87826_0.txt
"the break of day, seeing",87826_0.txt
secured a large sledge,87826_0.txt
"way open,",87826_0.txt
hammer and started for the jail. The,87826_0.txt
"hammer was not needed, as Sheriff Me-",87826_0.txt
Lain delivered the keys and the crowd,87826_0.txt
Mitchell's ell.,87826_0.txt
soon found,87826_0.txt
A rope was thrown around the negro's,87826_0.txt
neck and he was dragged out. When the,87826_0.txt
"outer door was reached the noose slipped,",87826_0.txt
but it was soon replaced and the condemned,87826_0.txt
man was hurried into the yard.,87826_0.txt
The rope was then thrown over one of,87826_0.txt
the limbs of a tree. Mitchell was jerked,87826_0.txt
up until his head struck the limb. His,87826_0.txt
neck was broken and his body dropped to,87826_0.txt
the ground. The crowd repeated the jerking,87826_0.txt
several times until they were sure,87826_0.txt
he was dead. There is some doubt as to,87826_0.txt
what occurred inside the jail from midnight,87826_0.txt
until the time of the lynching. The,87826_0.txt
"facts, as near as can be arrived at, are as",87826_0.txt
follows:,87826_0.txt
When the first attack was made on the,87826_0.txt
mounted,87826_0.txt
jail at 1:30 a. m. a dozen men,87826_0.txt
the rear step and two of them used a,87826_0.txt
sledge hammer on the doors. The local,87826_0.txt
militia company was under arms on the,87826_0.txt
inside with Sheriff McLain and his deputies,87826_0.txt
. Capt. George W. Leonard stepped,87826_0.txt
"out and said:"" I will give you three minutes",87826_0.txt
to disperse. If you do not do so I,87826_0.txt
"must fire.""",87826_0.txt
The crowd generally believed that Sheriff,87826_0.txt
McLain had already ordered the troops,87826_0.txt
to fire and they dispersed. But when the,87826_0.txt
attack was renewed on the rear door of,87826_0.txt
"the jail with sledge hammers, the firing",87826_0.txt
"took place and the crowd dispersed,",87826_0.txt
leaving their dead and wounded. It was,87826_0.txt
after three o'clock when Sheriff McLain,87826_0.txt
"telegraphed Governor Bushnell, at Woos-",87826_0.txt
"ter, Ohio, that a mob had attacked the",87826_0.txt
"jail, that he had opened fire, that his",87826_0.txt
force was inadequate and that assist-,87826_0.txt
ance was needed at once.,87826_0.txt
The colored people are greatly excited,87826_0.txt
over the affair. They had previously met,87826_0.txt
and adopted resolutions for the punish-,87826_0.txt
"ment of Mitchell, but many of them",87826_0.txt
talked about him not being guilty. Women,87826_0.txt
"children, as well as a multitude of men,",87826_0.txt
witnessed the lyching. There was no attempt,87826_0.txt
at disguise or secrecy. An hour or,87826_0.txt
"more after the lynching, Mitchell's body",87826_0.txt
was picked up and placed in a rough,87826_0.txt
"coffin, but left under the tree, where",87826_0.txt
hundreds of people continued to view it.,87826_0.txt
Later in the day the body was removed,87826_0.txt
by the coroner and other traces of the violence,87826_0.txt
were removed as fast as possible.,87826_0.txt
"Meantime, crowds of people poured into",87826_0.txt
the city from all surrounding towns and,87826_0.txt
viewed the blood stained steps of the jail,87826_0.txt
and the marks of the bullets on the surrounding,87826_0.txt
houses. Among the sights shown,87826_0.txt
visitors was a tree in the same court,87826_0.txt
house yard where a man named Ullery,87826_0.txt

MOB LAW.,87863_1.txt
There are times when the people,87863_1.txt
rise above the law and inflict punishment,87863_1.txt
without appeal to the,87863_1.txt
courts. But this extraordinary,87863_1.txt
power should be exercised only in,87863_1.txt
cases attended with atrocious circumstances,87863_1.txt
. There is one crime,87863_1.txt
which is almost universally attended,87863_1.txt
with death. This crime- the,87863_1.txt
crime against woman- is punisbed,87863_1.txt
with death at the hands of the mob,87863_1.txt
regardless of color or country. This,87863_1.txt
fact applies to the North as well as,87863_1.txt
"to the South, as was strikingly illustrated",87863_1.txt
"in the North, recently, by",87863_1.txt
the lynching of a negro at Urbana,87863_1.txt
"Ohio, and the killing of a white",87863_1.txt

the culprit was guilty of the name,87863_1.txt

punishment was the same. This,87863_1.txt

to our civilization. It shows,87863_1.txt
the high regard held for the sanctity,87863_1.txt
"of our women, and no nation has",87863_1.txt
ever prospered that has not reverenced,87863_1.txt
and respected women.,87863_1.txt
But it is to be doubted if a resort,87863_1.txt
to mob violence is ever justified as,87863_1.txt
a fitting punishment for any crime,87863_1.txt
outside of the one indicated above,87863_1.txt
"One can imagine, and there have",87863_1.txt
been instances of murders so heinous,87863_1.txt
and so atrocious that lynch law,87863_1.txt
"was justified, but these are the ex",87863_1.txt
that prove the rule. There,87863_1.txt
"fore ceptions, as a general thing, mob law is",87863_1.txt
not justified except in revenging,87863_2.txt
"and righting, in a measure, the",87863_2.txt
wrong done an innocent and virtu,87863_2.txt
woman. But the exercise of,87863_2.txt
ous,87863_2.txt
"mob yiolence, even in such cases, is",87863_2.txt
"demoralizing, in a measure, in its",87863_2.txt
"results, and brings the public to",87863_2.txt
hold the law in too light a regard,87863_2.txt
This leads the people to inflict brutal,87863_2.txt
mob punishment where it is not,87863_2.txt
deseryed. The lynching of a negro,87863_2.txt
in Cleveland county last Monday,87863_2.txt
night for the murder of T. T. John,87863_2.txt
son was utterly unjustified and unjustifiable,87863_2.txt
". First, there was",87863_2.txt
doubt as to the guilt of the negro,87863_2.txt
"in question; second, evidence is not",87863_2.txt
lacking that the white men created,87863_2.txt
"the disturbance, and, third, the",87863_2.txt
white men should have known better,87863_2.txt
than to be frolicking with negroes,87863_2.txt
It is a very easy thing for a row to,87863_2.txt
arise between a drunken white mar,87863_2.txt
and an ignorant negro. Whenever,87863_2.txt
whiskey and ignorance come in contact,87863_2.txt
there is to be trouble,87863_2.txt
Whiskey and ignorance met at a,87863_2.txt

"last Saturday, and the result was",87863_2.txt
. But the fight should not,87863_2.txt
as usual,87863_2.txt

The murder of Johnson was not such,87863_2.txt
an one as would justify mob law,87863_2.txt

The courts of Arkansas are competent,87863_2.txt

The report presents the affair in a,87891_1.txt
serious light. As a whole the Italian,87891_1.txt
authorities view the matter,87891_1.txt
of the,87891_1.txt
lynching as one of unusual atrocity,87891_1.txt
and without the mitigating circumstances,87891_1.txt
which had been urged in previous,87891_1.txt
affairs of this kind.,87891_1.txt
Dr. Hodges Was the Aggressor.,87891_1.txt
"In describing the first affray, which",87891_1.txt
"led up to the lynching, Marquis Ro-",87891_1.txt
mano's report states that Dr. Hodges,87891_1.txt
"was the first to draw his weapon, and",87891_1.txt
that not until he had fired one shot,87891_1.txt
and was about to fire the second one,87891_1.txt
"at Charles Difata, who was at the time",87891_1.txt

The Beginning of the Affray.,87891_2.txt
The circumstances leading up to the,87891_2.txt
affray are described in detail. According,87891_2.txt
to this account Charles Difata was,87891_2.txt
alone when Dr. Hodges passed. There,87891_2.txt
is no effort made in the report to obscure,87891_2.txt
the fact that Charles Difata,87891_2.txt
made the first offensive overture. But,87891_2.txt
it is contended that this was not accompanied,87891_2.txt
by the use of firearms or,87891_2.txt
even a movement to draw them. It is,87891_2.txt
"said, however, that Charles Difata upbraided",87891_2.txt
Dr. Hodges in an offensive way,87891_2.txt
for having killed an animal and accompanied,87891_2.txt
this by a blow of the fist.,87891_2.txt
"Then, it is stated, Dr. Hodges shot at",87891_2.txt
Difata. Whether or not the shot took,87891_2.txt
effect it was not possible for the Ital-,87891_2.txt
"ian authorities to learn, as the bodies",87891_2.txt
"of the men, after being lynched, were",87891_2.txt
disfigured and disposed of. But at all,87891_2.txt
events it is stated that Charles Difata,87891_2.txt
was on the ground following the shot,87891_2.txt
from Dr. Hodge's weapon. At this,87891_2.txt
point Joe Difata made his appearance,87891_2.txt
and seeing his brother down and a,87891_2.txt
"second shot about to be fired, shot",87891_2.txt

The First Lynchings.,87891_3.txt
Then followed the lynching of these,87891_3.txt

"that the mob, having already lynched",87891_4.txt
"Charles and Joe Difata, turned their",87891_4.txt
attention to the three Italians under,87891_4.txt

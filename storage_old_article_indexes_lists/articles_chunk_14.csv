difficulty with an old negro named,88095_1.txt
"an Betts, who lived near Varner, about",88095_1.txt
some rents. Betts went to Nelson's,88095_1.txt
house to settle up the matter about,88095_1.txt
some rents due Betts' mother- in- law,88095_1.txt
which they claimed Nelson had received,88095_1.txt
from a man named Hill with,88095_1.txt
instructions that the money be turned,88095_1.txt
off over to the women. Nelson denied,88095_1.txt
having received the money. This,88095_1.txt
at brought about a quarrell and without,88095_1.txt
any warning Nelson suddenly,88095_1.txt
drew an ax struck old man Betts a,88095_1.txt
blow and severed his right leg from,88095_1.txt
his body. The old man fell prostrate,88095_1.txt
to the ground and his assailant jumped,88095_1.txt
on him with both feet and stamped,88095_1.txt
him to death. Nelson was arrested,88095_1.txt
and placed in jail at Varnar. On,88095_1.txt
the night of the 13th of November,88095_1.txt
- last the aboved named negroes indicted,88095_1.txt

in behalf of the election of Henry Clay,88172_0.txt
to the presidency. About the close of,88172_0.txt
that campaign he joined the Presbyterian,88172_0.txt
church and soon afterward concluded,88172_0.txt
to enter the ministry. Accordingly,88172_0.txt

"he was a powerful preacher, he",88172_0.txt
was not destined to do his great work,88172_0.txt
in the pulpit. He again returned to St.,88172_0.txt
Louis and established the St. Louis Observer,88172_0.txt
", the first issue of which appeared",88172_0.txt
"November 22, 1833. It was essentially",88172_0.txt
"a religious newspaper, but the editor",88172_0.txt
could not keep down his intense love of,88172_0.txt
liberty and his convictions in regard to,88172_0.txt
the slavery question. It was impossible,88172_0.txt
for him not soon to become involved in,88172_0.txt
"the discussion of the subject, and one",88172_0.txt
day he wrote an editorial setting forth,88172_0.txt
"his opinions so strongly, that when it",88172_0.txt
appeared the community was thrown,88172_0.txt
at once into a furore of excitement. He,88172_0.txt
was away at a synodical meeting when,88172_0.txt
"it was printed, and the owners of the",88172_0.txt
press and property he occupied were,88172_0.txt
compelled to hastily print a card explaining,88172_0.txt
"it away, to prevent mob violence",88172_0.txt
. On his return he was confronted,88172_0.txt
with a paper signed by the most influential,88172_0.txt
"papers, including the minister of",88172_0.txt
"his church, setting forth the opinion",88172_0.txt
that slavery was divinely sanctioned,88172_0.txt
him to desist from his,88172_0.txt
and asking,88172_0.txt
course.,88172_0.txt
Lovejoy printed the paper with all,88172_0.txt
signatures and appended his reply. The,88172_0.txt
gist of the letter was that the editor,88172_0.txt
claimed the right to publish his honest,88172_0.txt
"convictions on any subject, and answering",88172_0.txt
the plea of Bibilical justification,88172_0.txt
", he said:",88172_0.txt
""" Make not slaves of others if you",88172_0.txt
would not be made slaves of yourselves,88172_0.txt
".""",88172_0.txt
His statements were couched in the,88172_0.txt
"most inoffensive language, but nevertheless",88172_0.txt
again stirred the ire of the citizens,88172_0.txt
.,88172_0.txt
Things went on in this way until his,88172_0.txt
presses were taken away by the owners,88172_0.txt
. but a few who sided with him,88172_0.txt
got them restored on condition that he,88172_0.txt
"would come to Illinois, where his utterances",88172_0.txt
might be safely circulated. He,88172_0.txt
"made the change, but the St. Louis people",88172_0.txt
then relented and called him back.,88172_0.txt
"It happened, however, that a negro,",88172_0.txt
"arrested for a crime, assaulted the officers",88172_0.txt
and killed one of them. A mob,88172_0.txt
soon after took him from the jail and,88172_0.txt
burned him at the stake. When the,88172_0.txt
trial of some of the ringleaders in this,88172_0.txt
"act came up, the judge dismissed them",88172_0.txt
on the ground that the negro had been,88172_0.txt
incited to his act by reading the Observer,88172_0.txt
", and that there was no law to",88172_0.txt
punish them.,88172_0.txt
This was too much. Lovejoy published,88172_0.txt
an editorial reply so scathing in its,88172_0.txt
criticism that he knew violence must,88172_0.txt
"follow, and at once shipped his plant to",88172_0.txt
"Alton. He arrived here on Sunday, July",88172_0.txt
"21, 1836. He left it in the warehouse",88172_0.txt
"over night, and before daylight it was",88172_0.txt
destroyed by a mob. This at once,88172_0.txt
transferred the trouble to Illinois. A,88172_0.txt
meeting was held next night in the,88172_0.txt
"Presbyterian church, where the editor",88172_0.txt
"made an address, stating that he had",88172_0.txt
come to Alton in good faith to publish a,88172_0.txt
religious newspaper; that his object,88172_0.txt
evidently been misunderstood;,88172_0.txt
had,88172_0.txt
"that he was not an abolitionist, but was",88172_0.txt
honestly opposed to slavery. He also,88172_0.txt
said that having removed from the seat,88172_0.txt
"of slavery, he need not now continue to",88172_0.txt
"fight it,"" that it would be cowardice to",88172_0.txt
fly from a slave state to attack its,88172_0.txt
"methods from free soil.""",88172_0.txt
"He was sincere in this profession, and",88172_0.txt
thus mollified public opinion so that,88172_0.txt
"funds were soon raised, and on Sep-",88172_0.txt
"tember 8, 1836, he printed the first number",88172_0.txt

power of editorial utterances,88172_0.txt
"soon made the publication its famous, and",88172_0.txt
all went well until the slave question,88172_0.txt
came up again in earnest. Mr. Love-,88172_0.txt
joy was still smarting under the check,88172_0.txt

of manly indignation the attempt of,88172_0.txt
England to lay a yoke on our fathers,88172_0.txt
which neither they nor their children,88172_0.txt
"could bear. Alas, what bitter mockery",88172_0.txt
this is! We assemble to thank God for,88172_0.txt

by slaves on a soil moistened,88172_0.txt
with their blood drawn from them by,88172_0.txt
"the whip of a Republican taskmaster.""",88172_0.txt
No sooner was this read than the,88172_0.txt
men of the city held a meeting in the,88172_0.txt
"market house, and with strange inconsistency",88172_0.txt
claimed the right to free,88172_0.txt
"speech for themselves, while plotting to",88172_0.txt
deprive another of that same privilege.,88172_0.txt
A committee was appointed to request,88172_0.txt
Lovejoy to cease agitating slavery matters,88172_0.txt
". The latter, fearing to meet him",88172_0.txt
"face to face, sent him a letter to this",88172_0.txt
effect. He replied by denying their,88172_0.txt
right to dictate to him what he should,88172_0.txt
"discuss, and tendered them at the",88172_0.txt
same time the use of his paper to refute,88172_0.txt
his arguments if they were incorrect.,88172_0.txt
But the malcontents chose a more summary,88172_0.txt
course. On the night of August,88172_0.txt
"25 a mob attacked the Observer office,",88172_0.txt
and after driving out the employes,88172_0.txt
completely demolished the press.,88172_0.txt
"The act was boldly committed, but no",88172_0.txt
attempt at punishment followed. The,88172_0.txt
"anti- slavery citizens, deeply incensed",88172_0.txt
"as they were, had no choice but to submit",88172_0.txt
", and quietly sent for a new press.",88172_0.txt
"This arrived in due time, but Lovejoy",88172_0.txt
"was away at the time, and on the night",88172_0.txt
of its arrival it was taken from the,88172_0.txt
house and thrown into the Mississippi.,88172_0.txt
Then several public meetings were,88172_0.txt
"held, the objects of which were to affect",88172_0.txt
"a compromise, but it was a foregone",88172_0.txt
conclusion that the friends of liberty,88172_0.txt
"must make all the concessions, and",88172_0.txt
it was also self- evident that Lovejoy,88172_0.txt
would never accede to this.,88172_0.txt
""" Mr. Chairman,"" he said,"" what have",88172_0.txt

is the right of any body of men to say,88172_0.txt
whether I shall or shall not publish a,88172_0.txt
paper in this city.*** I plant myself,88172_0.txt
"down on my unquestionable rights,",88172_0.txt
"and the question to be decided is, whether",88172_0.txt

Thus the brave reformer defied his,88172_0.txt
"fate, and when the fourth press arrived",88172_0.txt
"early in the morning of November 7,",88172_0.txt
"by steamer, it was evident that a crisis",88172_0.txt
was at hand. It was stored in the stone,88172_0.txt
warehouse of Godfrey& Gilman. That,88172_0.txt
night a drunken mob demanded the,88172_0.txt
"press. It being refused, an attack was",88172_0.txt
made on the building. The defenders,88172_0.txt
"fired upon the mob, killing one and",88172_0.txt
wounding several men This cleared,88172_0.txt
the square for a time; but. soon the at-,88172_0.txt
tack was renewed. Another volley,88172_0.txt
caused a second retreat. The place,88172_0.txt
seemed deserted. The defenders supposed,88172_0.txt
they had been victorious; a few,88172_0.txt
"of them, with Lovejoy, stepped outside,",88172_0.txt
and in to the trap laid. A dozen assassins,88172_0.txt
fired upon the editor from some,88172_0.txt
"piles of cordwood, and with the words,",88172_0.txt
""" My God, I am shot,"" he expired with",88172_0.txt
five bullets in his body.,88172_0.txt
After this the anti- slavery troubles,88172_0.txt
ceased in Alton. The Observer was,88172_0.txt
never revived and the incident passed,88172_0.txt
into history. But it seemed to have,88172_0.txt
left a blight upon the city. Up to that,88172_0.txt
time Alton promised to become the metropolis,88172_0.txt
of the Mississippi valley. It,88172_0.txt
was larger as it was also older than St.,88172_0.txt
"Louis, and was the head of navigation",88172_0.txt
on the Mississippi. But with Lovejoy's,88172_0.txt
death a period of retrogression set in,88172_0.txt
"that lasted 20 years, and it is only within",88172_0.txt
the past decade that the old and,88172_0.txt
beautiful bluff city has fully recovered,88172_0.txt
from the ban of that terrible experience,88172_0.txt

A DASTARDLY DEED.,88237_0.txt
One of the most dastardly deeds,88237_0.txt
ever committed in the criminal annals,88237_0.txt
of Arkansas took place at Mc,88237_0.txt
morning at 3,88237_0.txt
Gehee last Monday,88237_0.txt
o'clock when Sam Fleming was taken,88237_0.txt
from a calaboose and lynched. The,88237_0.txt
negro had committed no crime de,88237_0.txt
serving such a penalty. On Sunday,88237_0.txt
"afternoon, it is related, Fleming and",88237_0.txt
a white saloon keeper named Vaughn,88237_0.txt
involved a difficulty in,88237_0.txt
became in,88237_0.txt
worsted.,88237_0.txt
which the white man was,88237_0.txt
Fleming was arrested on the charge,88237_0.txt
of disturbing the peace and placed,88237_0.txt
in the calaboose. Monday morning,88237_0.txt
when the officers went for Fleming,88237_0.txt
they found the door of the calaboose,88237_0.txt
had been removed and the prisoner,88237_0.txt
A search revealed the fact,88237_0.txt
was gone.,88237_0.txt
that Fleming's body was dangling,88237_0.txt
from the limb of a tree. So quietly,88237_0.txt
"was it done, says the report, that not",88237_0.txt
even the girl in the telephone office,88237_0.txt
just across the street from where,88237_0.txt
"the negro was"" lynched"" knew of the",88237_0.txt
incident.,88237_0.txt
From the foregoing it will be seen,88237_0.txt
that Fleming was guilty of no great,88237_0.txt
"er offense than a breach of the peace,",88237_0.txt
"therefore, even if guilty, he could only",88237_0.txt
be fined under the law. He had committed,88237_0.txt
no felony; he had not com,88237_0.txt
crime for,88237_0.txt
mitted the unspeakable,88237_0.txt
which the punishment in the South is,88237_0.txt
death. He had only disturbed the,88237_0.txt
"peace and hipped a white man, apparently",88237_0.txt
"no better than himself, and",88237_0.txt
"for this he was"" lynched.""",88237_0.txt
The affair does not partake of the,88237_0.txt
"dignity of a"" lynching."" In the opinion",88237_0.txt
of the Graphic lynch- law is,88237_0.txt
But this was,88237_0.txt
sometimes justifiable.,88237_0.txt
"murder- cold blooded, unprovoked",88237_0.txt
and premeditated murder and the,88237_0.txt
parties guilty of it are murderers.,88237_0.txt
From the evidence at hand the deed,88237_0.txt
"was the work of a few men, actuated",88237_0.txt
purely by motives of revenge and,88237_0.txt
murder. It was a dastardly deed,88237_0.txt
that reflects upon the cilivization of,88237_0.txt
our State. It is such things as this,88237_0.txt
that bring the South into disrepute.,88237_0.txt
and causes our civilization and laws,88237_0.txt
oftentimes to become a by- word and,88237_0.txt
a reproach. As the Graphic has,88237_0.txt
remarked. lynching is,88237_0.txt
previously,88237_0.txt
"murder,",88237_0.txt
"sometimes justifiable, but",88237_0.txt
never! The officers of Desha county,88237_0.txt

LYNCHING.,88241_0.txt
Reference was made in these columns,88241_0.txt
a few days ago to the encouraging,88241_0.txt
decrease in the number of,88241_0.txt
"lynchings, as shown by the statist: es",88241_0.txt
for 1907. The decrease is in itself,88241_0.txt
cause for congratulation. But a,88241_0.txt
a,88241_0.txt
more careful examinat on of the tabulated,88241_0.txt
statement reveals some facts,88241_0.txt
that should bring us to serious,88241_0.txt
thought. It appears that the crime,88241_0.txt
usually associated with lynching in,88241_0.txt
the public mind had comparatively,88241_0.txt
small place among the causes of this,88241_0.txt
type of lawlessness in the last year.,88241_0.txt
If the statement from which we get,88241_0.txt
"information be correct, many lynchings",88241_0.txt
were not the result of rape;,88241_0.txt

Mrs. White was picking cotton near,88268_1.txt

assault was made. The miscreant evidently,88268_1.txt

"throw into the water, but it was found",88268_1.txt
next day in some vines. It was clotted,88268_1.txt
with blood.,88268_1.txt
When Mrs. White failed to return,88268_1.txt
at dusk the search began. It was over,88268_1.txt

then by a low gurgling groan coming,88268_1.txt
from the canes.,88268_1.txt
"Her skull was crushed in, jawbones",88268_1.txt
broken and face and head cut and,88268_1.txt

Baker's only offense was that he had,88288_0.txt

that the country is anxiously waiting to,88288_0.txt

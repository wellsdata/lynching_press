HE LATE MR. DOOLEY used to say that the trouble with the,bp512.txt
Negro is that he is too easily lyrched. To paraphrase Mr. Doug-,bp512.txt
"lass' expression: ""The race that is lynched easiest is lynched",bp512.txt
"u.terest"" The Negro, being the most frequent victim of mob violence,",bp512.txt
makes the greatest outcry against the barbarity and iniquity of it. The,bp512.txt

The reactionary effect of the rabies,bp512.txt

America is the most murderous,bp512.txt

THE NEW LYNCHING EXCUSE,bp518.txt
O,bp518.txt
"NCE upon a time, not so very long ago.",bp518.txt
the mobocrats attempted to justify lynch-,bp518.txt
"ing on the theory that ""lynching Negroes",bp518.txt
was the only way it was possible to to protect,bp518.txt
white womanhood from the lust of colored,bp518.txt
3101.,bp518.txt
That was the excuse heralded in the press.,bp518.txt
From every political rostrum throughout the,bp518.txt
"Southland would-be office holders shouted, ""I",bp518.txt
would lead a mob to protect white women-,bp518.txt
the flower of this State-from fiendish Ne-,bp518.txt
"grocs."" And newspapers in the North accepted",bp518.txt
the excuse and gave it support.,bp518.txt
"But Southern white women, tired of being",bp518.txt
"the ""goat"" for the bestial pastime of their",bp518.txt
"sponses, proclaimed that their virtue needed no",bp518.txt
such protection. They dug into the records and,bp518.txt
found that the majority of lynchings were not,bp518.txt
even the result of ALLEGED assaults on white,bp518.txt
It was established as an irrefutable,bp518.txt
fact that lynching was the result of many things,bp518.txt
ther than for the protection of the honor of,bp518.txt
Southern women; Negroes are being lynched,bp518.txt
for talking back to white men and other such,bp518.txt
minor provocations.,bp518.txt
women.,bp518.txt
Since the white women have proclaimed to,bp518.txt
the world that they do not need mobs to pro-,bp518.txt
tect their honor; and since that sham has been,bp518.txt
shattered the lynchers have invented another,bp518.txt
excuse to justify their acts of barbarism. They,bp518.txt
now claim that the slowness of the law is re-,bp518.txt
sponsible for lynching. That the criminal law,bp518.txt
"takes too long to operate, therefore, the mob",bp518.txt
takes the law into its own hands.,bp518.txt
This excuse is being accepted and given,bp518.txt
widespread support by those who should know,bp518.txt
better. The slow machinery of the criminal,bp518.txt
courts is even less responsible for lynchings,bp518.txt
than the now abandoned theory of protecting,bp518.txt
white women. The criminal procedure of Amer-,bp518.txt
ican courts was established to insure justice for,bp518.txt
those accused of crime. Those who are intelli-,bp518.txt
geut understand that the so called delays of the,bp518.txt
courts have saved many innocent man from,bp518.txt
death. At the same time some who are guilty,bp518.txt
have escaped-but after an innocent man has,bp518.txt
been killed or spent long terms in prison it is,bp518.txt
impossible to rectify the mistake or repair the,bp518.txt
damage done through haste.,bp518.txt
It is possible during the hysteria following,bp518.txt
a crime for an innocent victim to be connected,bp518.txt
"with it by a chain of circumstances which, un-",bp518.txt
"explained, points to his guilt. But given time",bp518.txt
he can prove his innocence.,bp518.txt
Where a Negro is accused of a serious crime,bp518.txt
against a white than or woman his successful,bp518.txt
prosecution is as certain as anything can be.,bp518.txt
Certainly this is true in the South where the,bp518.txt
"majority of lynchings occur. The judge, the",bp518.txt
"jury, all of the officials are white and have cer-",bp518.txt
tain fixed ideas before the trial begins. Under,bp518.txt
such circumstances even an innocent Negro has,bp518.txt
not got a chance. (Take the Scottsboro cases,bp518.txt
"as an illustration.) Then, how can it be reason-",bp518.txt
"ed that the law is too slow? It is a lame excuse,",bp518.txt

saulting an aged white women. The Negro,bp529.txt
prisoner was hanged from the limb of a tree,bp529.txt
directly in front of the home of Judge Duer.,bp529.txt
His body was then dragged half a mile along,bp529.txt
Main St. to a blazing pile in the center of the,bp529.txt
street and bere burned. Here is the way the,bp529.txt
lynching was described by the Associated,bp529.txt
Press:,bp529.txt
"""The marchi to the scene of the lynching of",bp529.txt
Armwood was wild in the extreme. The mob,bp529.txt
"members seemed crazed, continually leaping",bp529.txt
"on the Negro, even after he fell to the ground",bp529.txt
"and was unable to rise. One boy, apparently",bp529.txt
"about 18 years old, slashed the Negro's car al-",bp529.txt
"most off with a knife. Under the oak tree,",bp529.txt
"despite the presence of women and children,",bp529.txt
all the victim's clothes were torn from his body,bp529.txt
"and he hung there for some minutes nude.""",bp529.txt
"The victim may have been guilty, although",bp529.txt
it is the responsibility of a court of law to,bp529.txt
decide that question. Even if Armwood com-,bp529.txt
mitted the atrocious assault with which he was,bp529.txt
charged. lynching is utterly indefensible on,bp529.txt

act of ferocious lawlessness. But it must be,bp529.txt

If the matter is left in the hands of local au-,bp529.txt
"thorities, popular passion will prevent effective",bp529.txt
action. The experience of half a century makes,bp529.txt
imperative the enactment of a federal anti-,bp529.txt
lynching law. Nowhere else in the world is,bp529.txt
lynching such an ingrained habit as in the,bp529.txt

I cannot now say whether it was my raw,bp536.txt
human goodness or the recollection of my own,bp536.txt
similar predicament some years ago that made,bp536.txt
me so quickly responsive to his appeal. It happened in this wise:,bp536.txt
"I had just lectured in Springfield, Ill., and had boarded, as I thought.",bp536.txt
"a train for Cincinnati, Ohio, where I was booked for the high school",bp536.txt
commencement address the next evening. An attendant had directed me,bp536.txt
"to the wrong train. When I handed the conductor my ticket, he hastily",bp536.txt
scanned it and queried about my destination. On informing him that I,bp536.txt
was bound for Cincinnati I was advised that the train was moving in the,bp536.txt
opposite direction as fast as the wheels would roll. The conductor kindly,bp536.txt
suggested that he would inquire at the next stop about a taxi by which I,bp536.txt
might return to Springfield. The rate was $15. I was not in funds to,bp536.txt
meet the demands of the robber.,bp536.txt
THE TRAIN MASTER then advised that he would carry me to the next,bp536.txt
"town-Pleasant Plains, Sangamon County, sacred to Abraham Lincoln",bp536.txt
-where I might stay over night and catch the same train the next,bp536.txt
morning in time for my Cincinnati engagement. I arrived at this sleepy,bp536.txt
"town about 8 o'clock, and diligently looked all around, but there was no",bp536.txt

Abraham Lincoln's old state where the sun is not allowed to set on a,bp536.txt
Negro's head.,bp536.txt
Darkness was fast covering the town with the mantle of night.,bp536.txt
looked around and saw opposite the depot what looked like a rustic hotel,bp536.txt
and started in that direction when the lights were suddenly blown out for,bp536.txt
the night. I then returned to the station and listened for the moment to,bp536.txt
the depot crowd indulging in about the same grade of talk as prevailed in,bp536.txt
Lincoln's day. I en put my psychology to work. In the language of,bp536.txt
"Robert Burns, I ""tint my reason a' together."" and picked out a man of",bp536.txt

"good care of this gentleman. Having refused the proffer of cigar money,",bp536.txt
"my guide, philosopher and friend wended his homeward way and left me",bp536.txt
there to darkness and to Ben.,bp536.txt
THE READER WILL please note,bp536.txt

Race prejudice was rather in the passive than the active voice. The,bp536.txt

"to Ben's cottage I allowed my volunteer guide to do most of the talking,",bp536.txt

MENCKEN AND THE MARYLANDERS AND THE MARYLANDERS,bp552.txt
"Tappears from our metropolitan dailies, that Mr.",bp552.txt
Mencken of the Baltimore Sun and his friends across,bp552.txt
the Chesapeake Bay have been exchanging courtesies,bp552.txt
anent the lynching of a Negro by an eastern shore,bp552.txt
"mob. In his own typical fashion, Mr. Mencken has catalogued",bp552.txt
the Marylanders along with a few southern states having out-,bp552.txt
standing records for lynching. Not only did the Marylanders,bp552.txt
"take offense at some of Mr. Mencken's criticisms, but the Vir-",bp552.txt
"ginians close by decided that Mr. Mencken included them, and",bp552.txt
they likewise rose to rebuke Mr. Mencken in language not found,bp552.txt
"in the New Testament, to say the least.",bp552.txt
It appears that a lynching took place in Salisbury several,bp552.txt
weeks ago. Quite a little stir was made as a result of the mob,bp552.txt
violence. It was also reported in high places that the members,bp552.txt
of the mob were well known to the local authorities. To make,bp552.txt
"the records read smoothly, the Governor is reported to have",bp552.txt
issued the customary orders to apprehend the lynchers. What,bp552.txt
Mr. Mencken complained of was the evident lack of inclination,bp552.txt
on the part of the local authorities either to carry out the,bp552.txt
orders of the Governor or to make any attempt to apprehend,bp552.txt
"the guilty. In short, the lynchers decided that the party was!",bp552.txt
a success and nothing more was to be said or done about it.,bp552.txt
Mr. Mencken referred to the community responsible for,bp552.txt
the lynching in language typically his own. He certainly did,bp552.txt
"not refer to them in complimentary terms. In fact, he actually",bp552.txt
"called them nicknames, not altogether inapplicable either, and",bp552.txt
this originated the exchange of courtesies.,bp552.txt
It is said that the Marylanders decided to boycott Balti-,bp552.txt
more business houses as a retaliation. It is reported that busi-,bp552.txt
"ness amounting to over $100,000 per day was discontinued with",bp552.txt
certain Baltimore business houses. When this method did not,bp552.txt

"difference and incompetence. Bannon, who was",bp569.txt
"admittedly mentally abnormal, had confessed to",bp569.txt

sie County jail was so unsafe that the sheriff,bp569.txt
"himself said ""anyone can get out of that jail",bp569.txt

Now here is where criminal negligence comes,bp569.txt
"in. A week before the trial, over the protest of",bp569.txt
"the defense attorney, the State's Attorney or-",bp569.txt
dered Bannon back to Schafer supposedly for,bp569.txt
questioning and placed him in this worthless jail.,bp569.txt
One unarmed deputy was ordered to keep guard,bp569.txt
so the mob which had been denied its victim now.,bp569.txt
had him presented to it on a silver platter. That,bp569.txt
"night the mob came, took Bannon, and strung him",bp569.txt
from a railroad bridge.,bp569.txt
This lynching is directly chargeable to official,bp569.txt
indifference-amounting to criminal negligence.,bp569.txt
The State's Attorney ordered the prisoner from a,bp569.txt
"safe jail to an unsafe one, his excuse being that",bp569.txt
no one had warned him of the approaching crime.,bp569.txt
"Why, of course not! And mind you, the mob was",bp569.txt
made up in the very town in which he lived. The,bp569.txt
sheriff took absolutely no precautions for protect-,bp569.txt
[ing his prisoner in spite of the fact that he knew,bp569.txt
"that feeling was running high. The Governor,",bp569.txt
who appeared to be ignorant of the whole state,bp569.txt
"of affairs, has made the usual promise of an in-",bp569.txt
"vestigation, but up to the present time no results",bp569.txt
have been forthcoming and none will be. If he,bp569.txt
meant business he would have begun with his,bp569.txt
State's Attorney and proceeded next to the sheriff.,bp569.txt
Perhaps the fact that a revival meeting was in,bp569.txt
progress in the town from which the lynching,bp569.txt
party set out may have given added impetus to,bp569.txt
the lynching party. At any rate it is a sad com-,bp569.txt

minister who interested himself in the case was,bp569.txt
"the pastor of Bannon's mother, and he to the",bp569.txt
extent of obtaining a confession.,bp569.txt
If the Federal Council of Churches keeps up,bp569.txt
these investigations it will find that the majority,bp569.txt
of lynchings are easily preventable where officials,bp569.txt
"are determined and alert, and on the contrary",bp569.txt

"in behalf of a Negro, so we may not expect our Southern",bp573.txt
"courts to grow too enthusiastic at the trial of any Negro,",bp573.txt
regardless of his innocence-but a beginning is better than,bp573.txt
nothing. We have had such a beginning in some parts of the,bp573.txt

beginning.,bp573.txt
"Recently in Kentucky, down in McCracken County, one",bp573.txt

"The prisoner, under heavy guard, entered a plea of not guilty.",bp573.txt
whereupon the court selected an attorney to defend the pris-,bp573.txt
"oner. The Commonwealth proceeded to offer its testimony,",bp573.txt
which consisted of persons who identified the defendant and,bp573.txt
"connected him with the shooting, and, following this testimony",bp573.txt
"by the Commonwealth, the defense offered nothing. The court",bp573.txt
"proceeded to charge the jury, and it took the jury one hour",bp573.txt
to decide the guilt of the defendant. Here is a case where,bp573.txt
the South is trying to give Negroes accused of crime against,bp573.txt
white people a fair and impartial trial. This is a beginning.,bp573.txt
"Quite feeble, we admit, and decidedly an inadequate expression",bp573.txt
"of the law, but it is a beginning.",bp573.txt
"Down in Tennessee another Negro, Flowers by name, was",bp573.txt
"charged with murder. He was brought into court, and the",bp573.txt
witness who was relied upon to support the charge of murder,bp573.txt
against the defendant was a man who had served a prison term,bp573.txt

qualifying him to give competent testimony in any court.,bp573.txt
When the disqualifications of this witness were brought to the,bp573.txt
"attention of the judge, he ruled out all such testimony, and",bp573.txt
there was nothing to do but direct an acquittal of the defend-,bp573.txt

partial-trial. This attempt appears to us more serious and,bp573.txt
"sincere than the attempt made in McCracken County, Kentucky.",bp573.txt
Just think of what might have happened in either one,bp573.txt
of these cases if no attempt had been made to protect these,bp573.txt
defendants and to give them some sort of a trial. We admit,bp573.txt
that the Southern courts do not take themselves seriously when,bp573.txt
"they are trying Negroes, but we recite the instances above",bp573.txt
"simply as an indication that the South, while not giving Negroes",bp573.txt

from mobs; he pictured the United States Constitu-,bp600.txt

The Charleston News and Courier is perturbed because,bp600.txt
"Blease has made lynching the issue of the campaign,",bp600.txt
and says that South Carolina cannot renominate Blease,bp600.txt
without indorsing lynching. It says that Blease has,bp600.txt

weapon to use in their fight for the trial of lynchers,bp600.txt
in Federal courts.,bp600.txt

Referring to the recent outbreaks of mob violence and,bp609.txt
"lynching in several parts of the South, the Commission on Inter-",bp609.txt
racial Relations says:,bp609.txt
"""The responsibility of our religious leaders is equally",bp609.txt
obvious. Few will doubt that the preachers of the,bp609.txt
"South, if they would, could speedily build a Christian",bp609.txt
sentiment that would no longer tolerate lynchings. Yet,bp609.txt
for the most part they have nothing whatever to say,bp609.txt
about it. The occasional. exceptions are notable. Mean-,bp609.txt

"tinue, no preacher can escape a share of the responsi-",bp609.txt
bility unless he has delivered his soul in an honest ef-,bp609.txt
"fort to make such things impossible.""",bp609.txt
}},bp609.txt
This is a rather strong indictment of the white clergy of,bp609.txt
the South but it is nevertheless true. The Southern white min-,bp609.txt
"isters could wield a powerful influence for justice and right, but",bp609.txt
..whether they will in large numbers do so at any time in the,bp609.txt
near future is open to serious doubt. Here and there a white,bp609.txt
"minister will, like one of the gentlemen of the cloth in Sherman,",bp609.txt
"Texas, rise up and denounce the mistreatment or lynching of a",bp609.txt
"Negro, but as a rule the clergymen keep mum about such savage",bp609.txt
"orgie, if indeed they do not participate in them.",bp609.txt
"It should be remcinbered, however, that the Southern white",bp609.txt
church in its attitude toward the oppressed and persecuted,bp609.txt
Negro is but running true to form. From the earliest days it,bp609.txt
has been more interested in saving the souls of the Negroes in,bp609.txt
Africa than the bodies of those in Dixie. It defended the in-,bp609.txt
"stitution of chattel slavery to the bitter end, was arrayed",bp609.txt
against the embattled freedmen in the terrible decade of the,bp609.txt
"reconstruction, so-called, and in recent years when the revived",bp609.txt
"Ku Klux Klan was whipping, threatening, torturing, hanging",bp609.txt
"and burning whites and blacks, it remained silent or only offered",bp609.txt
half-hearted opposition.,bp609.txt
Sometimes we imagine it is rather naive to expect the,bp609.txt
Southern white church to act in accordance with the teachings,bp609.txt
of Jesus. After all it is more a great white social organization,bp609.txt
"than it is a Christian institution, and one cannot make saints",bp609.txt
out of mobbists by gathering them in churches on Sunday after,bp609.txt
"they have robbed, exploited and persecuted the six preceding",bp609.txt
days. The Interracial Commission might be striking closer to,bp609.txt
the root of the problem if it indicted the business interests of,bp609.txt
"Dixie for the continuation of mob violence. After all, they have",bp609.txt
"always been more powerful than the Southern white church, as",bp609.txt
shown by the fact that the church has always done their bid-,bp609.txt
ding. These interests dominate the press and politics as they,bp609.txt
"do the pulpit; they have always dominated them. Bankers,",bp609.txt
"planters, mill owners, realtors and merchants have but to say",bp609.txt
that lynching must cease and it will cease. That they have not,bp609.txt
seen fit to do so leads us to believe that they think such an,bp609.txt
action would be inimical to their economic interests. It is sig-,bp609.txt
nificant that before the Civil War when the bulk of the Negroes,bp609.txt
were private property and there was more enmity between,bp609.txt
"them and the poor whites than there is today, the business in-",bp609.txt
terests of the South would not permit the Negroes to be harmed,bp609.txt
just as they will not permit their profits to be interfered with,bp609.txt
today by mobs of white mill workers agitating for more wages,bp609.txt
and less work.,bp609.txt

WHAT A LYNCHING COSTS A LYNCHING COSTS,bp613.txt
According to press reports Governor,bp613.txt
Dan Moody of Texas gave specific or-,bp613.txt
ders that the Sherran mob bent on,bp613.txt
lynching a Negro should not be shot,bp613.txt
at. I suppose he was thinking that it,bp613.txt
would,bp613.txt
Would cost less to allow one Negro to be,bp613.txt
lynched than it would to save him,bp613.txt
from lynching by means of showing,bp613.txt
armed resistance to men about to take,bp613.txt
the law into their own hands. And,bp613.txt
think of the possible considerations,bp613.txt
by which he was moved. To really re-,bp613.txt
sist this mob of white Texans would,bp613.txt
involve the loss of Sherman's vote in,bp613.txt
the next political campaign. As for a,bp613.txt
city whose Nordic population was six-,bp613.txt
"sevenths of the total, its vote was not",bp613.txt
to be lightly looked upon. What was,bp613.txt
"one Negro's life over against hundreds,",bp613.txt
"perhaps thousands, of white votes?",bp613.txt
"Again, if the soldiery were to fire",bp613.txt
"upon a mob's ring leaders, there would",bp613.txt
be weeping and wailing in the homes of,bp613.txt
some of their familles. Why save the,bp613.txt
life of one Negro already foredoomed to,bp613.txt
death by law at the expense of the dis-,bp613.txt
tress that would thereby come to some,bp613.txt
homes of white law-breakers?,bp613.txt

fessed to such a crime as certain South-,bp613.txt
ern newspaper men still describe as,bp613.txt
justificatory of that extra legal means,bp613.txt
of expiation known as a lynching? To,bp613.txt
save this man's life from a mob bent,bp613.txt
"on doing ""justice"" would be an af-",bp613.txt
"front to white womanhood. Of course,",bp613.txt
many large organizations of the South's,bp613.txt
leading women have repeatedly gone on,bp613.txt
record as not needing any such bar-,bp613.txt
"barous ""proof"" of their virtue or ""pro-",bp613.txt

of that when dozens of Sherman's,bp613.txt
"white women, some with babies in",bp613.txt
"their arms, would be standing by with",bp613.txt
the milling crowds of white men and,bp613.txt
boys waiting to shout in glee at sight,bp613.txt
of a human body falling two stories to,bp613.txt
the ground with a sickening thud and,bp613.txt

"God-given rights to such Southern,",bp613.txt
Christian joy? That would be exact-,bp613.txt
ing too big a price for his life.,bp613.txt
But I surmise that brother Moody,bp613.txt
has had some other thoughts to ponder,bp613.txt
since last Friday evening..,bp613.txt
Even a,bp613.txt
damage suit in favor of a mob victim's,bp613.txt
relatives under a state anti-lynching,bp613.txt
law would not have amounted to what,bp613.txt
"it will cost to replace Sherman's $60,000",bp613.txt
"courthouse. Besides, along with the",bp613.txt
destruction of the building went the,bp613.txt
loss of many priceless legal and his-,bp613.txt

mentoes. There is also the monetary,bp613.txt
loss to the city in taxable values blown,bp613.txt

What Is The Cost?,bp613.txt
And what about the cost in inter-,bp613.txt

The danger is not confined to the immediate vic-,bp614.txt
"tims, to the poor Negroes who are often tortured into",bp614.txt
false confessions. It poisons the whole community. At,bp614.txt
Sherman the mob not only lynched a man; it destroyed,bp614.txt

"The state was compelled to declare martial law, and",bp614.txt

some of the mob leaders are imprisoned. Confronted,bp614.txt
"with such conduct in their elders, how can the children",bp614.txt
of that town grow up with any real respect for law?,bp614.txt
WHEN BERNARD SHAW was asked why he did,bp614.txt
not visit America he said that he did not want to be,bp614.txt
lynched. Americans resented the remark as a gratu-,bp614.txt
itous insult; but it struck straight at the root of mob,bp614.txt
"rule. Shaw realized that under mob rule no man, black",bp614.txt
"or white, is safe. He knew, also, that mob rule could",bp614.txt
not persist if the constituted authorities made a deter-,bp614.txt
mined attempt to stop it.,bp614.txt
SUCH AN ATTEMPT was certainly not made in,bp614.txt
"the Sherman lynching. In fact, it might be said that",bp614.txt
the authorities encouraged the mob by announcing that,bp614.txt
they would not deal drastically with it. The mob actu-,bp614.txt
ally murdered the man; but the one who sealed his,bp614.txt
"doom was none other than Dan Moody, Governor of",bp614.txt
the state. When the mob was storming the court house,bp614.txt
a telegram was sent to Governor Moody. In answer he,bp614.txt
"telegraphed: ""Hold the Negro if possible, but don't",bp614.txt
"shoot anybody."" Captain Hamer of the Texas Rangers.",bp614.txt
"said: ""This means that the mob will get the Negro.""",bp614.txt
"Assured of its immunity from shooting, the mob went",bp614.txt
ahead.,bp614.txt
INSTEAD OF STAYING the hand of the mob that,bp614.txt
"was violating the law, Governor Moody stayed the",bp614.txt
hand of the troops who were defending the law. His,bp614.txt
order prevented them from repulsing the mob. His atti-,bp614.txt
tude encouraged the mob to lynch the Negro and de-,bp614.txt
stroy a public building. He could not have done any,bp614.txt
more to burn that court house if he had headed the,bp614.txt
mob in person.,bp614.txt
AFTER THE LYNCHING was over and the mob,bp614.txt
had mostly dispersed Governor Moody ordered a bat-,bp614.txt

LYNCHING AND THE DEMOCRATS AND THE DEMOCRATS,bp629.txt
J,bp629.txt
UST when the Democratic Convention was about to open its,bp629.txt
"doors in Houston, Tex., the shadow of shame fell across the",bp629.txt
great state like some evil omen.¯¯A Negro was lynched at,bp629.txt
Houston.,bp629.txt
"This country, by this time, is accustomed to lynchings. The",bp629.txt
only query raised now when a lynching takes place is the query,bp629.txt
as to whether the victim is white or black. Lynchings no longer,bp629.txt
"astound us, so common has become the pastime in the United",bp629.txt
States. When the news spread that a lynching had taken place,bp629.txt
"right at the threshold of the Democratic Convention Hall, many",bp629.txt
"there were who looked upon the incident as a proverbial ""black",bp629.txt
"eye"" to the Democratic Convention and to the Democratic Cam-",bp629.txt
paign soon to be opened all over the country. There was a sort,bp629.txt
of restrained glee among those who preferred to look upon the,bp629.txt
incident as a sin visited upon the Democrats. The lynching per,bp629.txt
"se was lost sight of. In fact, the lynching was accepted as a",bp629.txt
visitation of the ill will of the gods upon the Democrats.,bp629.txt
We hold a different view. We believe that the lynching,bp629.txt
has a different significance. The Republican Convention was,bp629.txt
embarrassed at Kansas City by the daylight robbery of a bank.,bp629.txt
"The bandits were white, and the bank was a white institution.",bp629.txt
The Republicans shook off that embarrassment and proceeded,bp629.txt
orderly to nominate their candidate. The bank robbery per se,bp629.txt
"meant nothing to the Republicans, and they have forgotten it.",bp629.txt
Not so with the lynching. The lynching struck terror to the,bp629.txt
hearts of the Democrats. Houston bowed its head in shame,bp629.txt
mingled with a peculiar embarrassment. The lynching struck,bp629.txt
terror to the whole state of Texas because of the time and place,bp629.txt
of its occurrence. The Republicans may overlook a bank rob;,bp629.txt
"bery, but the Democrats cannot ignore a lynching which took",bp629.txt
place just when they were about to issue their proclamation to,bp629.txt
the public in the form of a party platform. If there ever was a,bp629.txt
"lynching that had any political value, it was the lynching at",bp629.txt
Houston. The Democrats are not going to ignore lynching.,bp629.txt
They are not going to dismiss this national crime with a mere,bp629.txt
slight wave of the hand. They are not going to forget that the,bp629.txt
lynchers and the mob leaders seek out white victims as well as,bp629.txt
black; and we think that the lynching is going to serve to in-,bp629.txt
spire the Democrats to deal boldly with lynching in their party,bp629.txt
platform.,bp629.txt
There will be those who will refer to the lynching during,bp629.txt
the campaign. We can imagine we hear the stump speakers de-,bp629.txt
claring that the Democratic campaign had a lynching as its cur-,bp629.txt
tain raiser. We imagine we can hear the orators charging that,bp629.txt
"lynching to the Democratic party. This will be not only unkind,",bp629.txt
but untrue. The Democrats accept that lynching at Houston,bp629.txt
"with its full significance, and we believe that it will serve to",bp629.txt
"keep before the convention not only the lawlessness of one kind,",bp629.txt
but lawlessness of every kind. Something good may yet come,bp629.txt
out of that lynching. It is hard to conceive that lynching can,bp629.txt
"contribute any good, but somehow we believe the lynching at",bp629.txt
Houston will shake the consciousness of the Democrats; that it,bp629.txt
will bring home to them the necessity for dealing with such an,bp629.txt
offense; and we are of the opinion that the party platform is-,bp629.txt
sued by the Democrats will deal definitely and specifically with,bp629.txt
lynching. If this outrage can be the source of renewed interest,bp629.txt
"in the helplessness of the black citizen in this country, it will",bp629.txt
have served a wonderful purpose; and if the Democrats can see,bp629.txt
"their golden opportunity to convert a shame into a party asset,",bp629.txt
it will redound to the credit of the Democrat party and to the,bp629.txt
convention.,bp629.txt
We deplore lynching wherever it is done and whenever it,bp629.txt
"is done. We think, however, that the lynching at Houston came",bp629.txt
at a time and under circumstances which made it a most un-,bp629.txt
"kind cut which may, in the final analysis, prove to be the most",bp629.txt
significant lynching this country has yet known. We entertain,bp629.txt
the hope that the Democrats will blot out this shame and the,bp629.txt
possibility of its repetition by the adoption of a plank that has,bp629.txt
"teeth in it. We say, “We entertain the hope."" }",bp629.txt

Why We Have Mobs We Have Mobs,bp638.txt
By SAM W. SMALL,bp638.txt
[In the Atlanta Constitution],bp638.txt
Did you ever get mixed up in a,bp638.txt
great mob bent on lynching a fellow,bp638.txt
"creature? Well, don't do it!",bp638.txt
It is one of the most horrific expe-,bp638.txt
"riences one can undergo, with very",bp638.txt
rare exceptions. In my long career,bp638.txt
as a newspaper man it has fallen to,bp638.txt
me to be tangled up in four such,bp638.txt
"congeries of crazy. cruel, uncontroll-",bp638.txt
able human beings temporarily,bp638.txt
turned savages.,bp638.txt
In one case two white men were,bp638.txt
strangled to death from the same,bp638.txt
limb of a tree. In another a Negro,bp638.txt
was hanged from the crossties of a,bp638.txt
railroad bridge. In the third instance,bp638.txt
a Negro was strung up to a lamp-,bp638.txt
post in the public square of a south-,bp638.txt
ern state capital. And in the fourth,bp638.txt
case a Negro was hanged to a tele-,bp638.txt
graph pole and riddled with bullets,bp638.txt
from a hundred pistols.,bp638.txt
All these mob lynchings were in,bp638.txt
southern states. In none of the cusOS,bp638.txt
"were the mobbers masked or hooded,",bp638.txt
and no attempt was made to disguise,bp638.txt
any of the participants. In all of the,bp638.txt
instances officers of the law protested,bp638.txt
"the proceedings strongly, but were ef-",bp638.txt
fectually prevented from interfering,bp638.txt
with the mob's operations. In each,bp638.txt
case,bp638.txt
confessedly,bp638.txt
the vietim Was,bp638.txt
guilty of the crime charged. hut he,bp638.txt
was in legal custody and would surely,bp638.txt
have been convicted and legally exe-,bp638.txt
cuted. The lynchings were absolutely,bp638.txt
uncalled for.,bp638.txt
The Mind of the Mob,bp638.txt
I would Fooner meet the Devil in,bp638.txt
full flaming regalia on any highway,bp638.txt
than to meet and oppose one of our,bp638.txt
common city or countryside mobs.,bp638.txt
The devil is a fellow of uncommon,bp638.txt
sense. He is willing to argue a caso,bp638.txt
with you.,bp638.txt
He did that several times,bp638.txt
even with Christ. And when you,bp638.txt
"resolutely command him to ""Get thea",bp638.txt
"hence!"" he gits.",bp638.txt
But with a raging-hearted mob it,bp638.txt
is a different case altogether.,bp638.txt
It is often said that a mob has no,bp638.txt
mind; that it is mass madness and,bp638.txt
wholly impelled by a common primi-,bp638.txt
tive impulse that puts aching ruge,bp638.txt
beyond the reach of reason and all,bp638.txt
our civilized and Christian inhibi-,bp638.txt
tions.,bp638.txt
But that diagnosis does not accord,bp638.txt
with my experiences with mobs.,bp638.txt
Each one of them had a master mind,bp638.txt
at the head of it and the masa behind,bp638.txt
the master had caught his spirit and,bp638.txt
"come to ""one mind and one heart""",bp638.txt
for the business at hand.,bp638.txt
On the occurrence in the commu-,bp638.txt
"nity of some unusual, unprovoked, or",bp638.txt
peculiarly brutal crime the people,bp638.txt
become excited and naturally en-,bp638.txt
raged against the perpetrator. If he,bp638.txt
is at large they organize a man-hunt,bp638.txt
to capture him and bring him to jux-,bp638.txt
tice. If he has been quickly taken,bp638.txt
and jailed they discuss the evidences,bp638.txt
"of his guilt, the enormity of his of-",bp638.txt
"fense, and the probabilities of his",bp638.txt
being adequately punished.,bp638.txt
How the Mob Genders,bp638.txt
In those sidewalk or roadside dia-,bp638.txt
cussions the mob genders. An indig-,bp638.txt
nant impetuous man suggests that,bp638.txt
"the only right thing to do is to ""take",bp638.txt
the damned scoundrel out and hang,bp638.txt
"him!"" He voices the universal in-",bp638.txt
stinet of self and home defense.,bp638.txt
becomes at once the prime minister,bp638.txt
of that law which is axiomatic in,bp638.txt
burharian tribes as in civilized gov-,bp638.txt
"ernment-""Salus populi suprema lex",bp638.txt
"est!"" the welfare of the people is",bp638.txt
the supreme law!,bp638.txt
Ho,bp638.txt
In the case at hand the law has,bp638.txt
"been outraged, the safety of person",bp638.txt
"and domicile violated, the security of",bp638.txt
"the community imperiled,",bp638.txt
course of common justice is too slow,bp638.txt
and the,bp638.txt
and uncertain to assure penalty upon,bp638.txt
the criminal and protection to society.,bp638.txt
Such is the argument that does not,bp638.txt
need a convention to affirm it or elo-,bp638.txt
quence. to make it convincing. It,bp638.txt
makes aII electric conquest of the,bp638.txt
psychology of the community and,bp638.txt
when the leader selzes that moment,bp638.txt
"to say ""Let's go!"" hundreds echo the",bp638.txt
ery and thousands follow famishly to,bp638.txt
get the prejudged wretch and wreak,bp638.txt
upon him what it believes to be,bp638.txt
righteous vengeance.,bp638.txt
They get him and promptly kill,bp638.txt
him. They hang him. perhaps shoot,bp638.txt
"him full of slugs, perhaps burn him",bp638.txt

No lover of organized law and or-,bp638.txt

It is the sworn duty of ministers of,bp638.txt

"of nearly white complexion, and then",bp707.txt

certain young girl was ignored by a,bp707.txt
"set of young, manly fellows who are",bp707.txt
well known in this city. Her reputa-,bp707.txt

was known before she arrived. She,bp707.txt
was made to feel uncomfortable and,bp707.txt
she left. Several days later about 7,bp707.txt
o'clock she was seen going down,bp707.txt
"Michigan boulevard in an auto, close",bp707.txt
to one of her white men. Her own,bp707.txt
race will be good enough for her and,bp707.txt
others when the whites find no use for,bp707.txt
her after her youth has gone. Then,bp707.txt
she will come back to her own people.,bp707.txt

The graduates and students of Fiske,bp707.txt
· University held a reception and dance,bp707.txt
at Dreamland Hall last Thursday,bp707.txt
evening. Visitors and friends of the,bp707.txt
school attended. A merry waltz was,bp707.txt
in progress when in paraded a south-,bp707.txt
ern white brute and lyncher and his,bp707.txt
mulatto lover. Right here in Chicago,bp707.txt
and in the very midst of those who,bp707.txt
denounce the way the white men,bp707.txt
treat our women in the South-right,bp707.txt
in the midst of the highest type of,bp707.txt
"young womanhood, they came and",bp707.txt
sat and were UNMOLESTED. The,bp707.txt
outrage! If it were in the very heart,bp707.txt
"of the South, where the young men",bp707.txt
"do not dare to raise a protest, it",bp707.txt
"would have been different; but here,",bp707.txt

manhood. They were unworthy to be,bp707.txt
called men. They lacked the moral,bp707.txt
courage to dare to ask them from their,bp707.txt
"reception, these scurfs of the world.",bp707.txt
Because she had attended the school,bp707.txt
would not even justify the act. Why,bp707.txt
should those who cane to spend an,bp707.txt
enjoyable evening be forced to sit,bp707.txt
"through this disgusting scene, or",bp707.txt
"leave, as many did? All day Friday",bp707.txt
the Chicago Defender received calls,bp707.txt
"over the 'phone, asking us to please",bp707.txt

dared to flaunt her low southern brute,bp707.txt
before the faces of decent mothers,bp707.txt
and sisters and not one word of prot-,bp707.txt
est was raised by the educated (?),bp707.txt
graduates of Fiske. The school is,bp707.txt
simply disgraced. Southern visitors,bp707.txt
expressed surprise that no effort was,bp707.txt
made to ask them to absent them-,bp707.txt
selves. We are mortified that such,bp707.txt
would ever occur in this city. The,bp707.txt
"Mann act, of course, has no effect on",bp707.txt
the southern white man and his black,bp707.txt
wench. In the South he parades when,bp707.txt
"and where he chooses, and no one",bp707.txt
"cares, for she is of black blood and",bp707.txt
he is white. Now we have a new,bp707.txt
phase to fight. A black woman who,bp707.txt
will parade her white lover before our,bp707.txt
very eyes voluntarily and seek to,bp707.txt
flaunt her vice in our society without,bp707.txt
"a protest from the weak-kneed ""Chol-",bp707.txt

all we have ever heard of or seen.,bp707.txt
She was one example. There are lots,bp707.txt
more here in Chicago. Our attention,bp707.txt
is daily drawn to mulatto girls who,bp707.txt
care only for certain jobs because,bp707.txt

Every Negro seen on the streets of South Orange became an,bp5.txt
"object of suspicion, and this feeling extended to every town within",bp5.txt

Then came embarrassment for the officials and the girl's family.,bp5.txt
The girl became conscious stricken and lost her nerve. She,bp5.txt

her story was that she had entered her mother's room in search of,bp5.txt

Here is a new excuse offered by a weak-kneed official in pallia-,bp6.txt
tion of lynching-The mob lynched its victim because of the insuffi-,bp6.txt
But,bp6.txt
ciency of laws against the crime of which he was accused.,bp6.txt
what about the thousands of Negroes that have been lynched? In,bp6.txt
each case of guilt there was plenty of law covering the crime. Take,bp6.txt
"the revoltingly atrocious instance which happened at Estill Springs,",bp6.txt
"Tenn., only a few weeks ago. The victim was accused of murder.",bp6.txt
"After he was captured by the mob, he was first tortured with red-hot",bp6.txt
irons and then burned alive. The laws of the state of Tennessee,bp6.txt
provide that murder shall be punished by death; and there is not the,bp6.txt
least doubt that if Jim McIlheron had been tried by a court he would,bp6.txt
have had the full penalty imposed upon him.,bp6.txt
Lynching mobs are not actuated by any desire to uphold justice,bp6.txt
and the law; they are actuated by sheer devilishness and contempt,bp6.txt
for law. It is not unlikely that in the mob which lynched Jim Mc-,bp6.txt
"Ilheron at Estill Springs there were unpunished murderers, men",bp6.txt
who had killed their man and escaped both trial and punishment.,bp6.txt
"At any rate, after the lynching almost every white man in the com-",bp6.txt

"What city, county and state officials need to suppress lynching",bp6.txt
"is not more laws, but the sense of duty and the courage to enforce",bp6.txt
the existing laws. No mob will face an officer determined to do his,bp6.txt
duty.,bp6.txt
The trouble is that in many communities there is a disregard,bp6.txt
of law on the part of the people and the officials. There are wide,bp6.txt
sections of the country in which there is not a single officer with the,bp6.txt
"courage to enforce the law he has sworn to uphold, and which he is",bp6.txt
being paid to uphold. There are wide sections of the country in,bp6.txt
which some excuse to lynch a Negro is seized upon whenever the,bp6.txt
desire is felt for a little extra excitement.,bp6.txt
"Naturally, the frequency with which Negroes may be lynched",bp6.txt
"with impunity dulls the excitement, and the blood lust of the mobs",bp6.txt
will begin to demand white victims.,bp6.txt
The red stain of lynching has been growing deeper and bigger,bp6.txt
"for thirty years; and if something is not done to wipe it out, it will",bp6.txt
"cover the whole country. And to wipe it out, we do not need more",bp6.txt

Prager is said to have addressed a meeting in an adjoining town,bp6.txt
"the night before, and it was alleged that he had talkekd Sosialism",bp6.txt

and captured him in Collinsville. He was compelled to march,bp6.txt
down the main street barefoot and draped with an American flag.,bp6.txt
The police rescued him and hid him in the city hall basement. Later,bp6.txt
the mob demanded the prisoner and when refused rushed the police,bp6.txt
"and dragged him out, led him away with a noose around his neck",bp6.txt
and hanged him.,bp6.txt
Subsequent dispatches state that no evidence of disloyalty on,bp6.txt
Prager's part has been established. He was a miner and was said,bp6.txt
to have had his first papers of citizenship. But with this man's in-,bp6.txt

The mayor declared that he would launch no investigation on,bp6.txt

the attitude of these so-called better classes of the Southern people and,bp7.txt

THE CHRISTIAN EDUCATOR.,bp7.txt
"IT IS COLOR THEN, NOT CRIME.",bp7.txt
"Again, I do not believe it, and deny it, because the charge is not",bp7.txt
"so much against the crime itself, as against the color of the man alleged",bp7.txt
"to be guilty of it. Slavery itself, you will remember, was a system of",bp7.txt
"legalized outrage upon the black women of the South, and no white",bp7.txt
"man was ever shot, burned, or hanged for availing himself of all the",bp7.txt
power that slavery gave him at this point.,bp7.txt
"Upon these grounds, then-grounds which I believe to be solid and",bp7.txt
"immovable-I dare here, and now in the Capital of the Nation, my",bp7.txt
"home, and in the presence of Congress, to reject it, and ask you, my",bp7.txt
"reader, and all just men, to reject this horrible charge so frequently",bp7.txt
made and construed against the Negro as a class.,bp7.txt
To sum up my argument on this lynching business: It remains to,bp7.txt
be said that I have shown that the Negro's accusers in this case have,bp7.txt
"violated their oaths, and have cheated the Negro out of his vote; that",bp7.txt
they have robbed and defrauded the Negro systematically and persist-,bp7.txt
"ently, and have boasted of it. I have shown that when the Negro",bp7.txt
"had every opportunity to commit the crime now charged against him,",bp7.txt
he was never accused of it by his bitterest enemies. I have shown,bp7.txt
"that during all the years of reconstruction, when he was being murdered",bp7.txt
"at Hamburg, Yazoo, New Orleans, Copiah, and elsewhere, he was never",bp7.txt
"accused of the crime now charged against him. I have shown that, in",bp7.txt
"the nature of things, no such change in the character and composition",bp7.txt
of a people as this charge implies could have taken place in the limited,bp7.txt
period allowed for it. I have shown that those who accuse him dare,bp7.txt
"not confront him in a court of law, and have their witnesses subjected",bp7.txt
"to proper legal inquiry. And in showing all this, and more, I have",bp7.txt
shown that they who charge him with this foul crime may be justly,bp7.txt
doubted and deemed unworthy of belief.,bp7.txt
HUMAN AND INHUMAN NATURE.,bp7.txt
But I shall be told by many of my Northern friends that my argu-,bp7.txt
"ment, though plausible, is not conclusive. It will be said that the",bp7.txt
"charges against the Negro are specific and positive, and that there must",bp7.txt
"be some foundation for them, because, as they allege, men in their nor-",bp7.txt
mal condition do not shoot and hang their fellow-men who are guilt-,bp7.txt
"less of crime. Well! This assumption is very just, very charitable.",bp7.txt
I only ask something like the same justice and charity could be shown,bp7.txt
to the Negro as well as to the mob. It is ereditable to the justice and,bp7.txt
humanity of the good people of the North by whom it is entertained.,bp7.txt
They rightly assume that men do not shoot and hang their fellow-men,bp7.txt
without just cause. But the vice of their argument is in their assump-,bp7.txt
THE CHRISTIAN EDUCATOR.,bp7.txt
107,bp7.txt
tion that the lynchers are like other men. The answer to that argu-,bp7.txt
"ment is, what may be truly predicated of human nature under one",bp7.txt
condition is not what may be true of human nature under another.,bp7.txt
Uncorrupted human nature may shudder at the commission of such,bp7.txt
crimes as those of which the Southern mob is guilty.,bp7.txt
"But human nature uncorrupted is one thing, and human nature",bp7.txt
corrupted and perverted by long abuse of irresponsible power is quite,bp7.txt
another and different thing. No man can reason correctly on this,bp7.txt
question who reasons on the assumption that the lynchers are like,bp7.txt
ordinary men.,bp7.txt
"We are not, in this case, dealing with men in their natural condi-",bp7.txt
"tion, but with men brought up in the exercise of arbitrary power.",bp7.txt
"We are dealing with men whose ideas, habits, and customs are entirely",bp7.txt
"different from those of ordinary men. It is, therefore, quite gratuitous",bp7.txt
to assume that the principles that apply to other men apply to the,bp7.txt
"Southern murderers of the Negro, and just here is the mistake of",bp7.txt
the Northern people. They do not see that the rules resting upon the,bp7.txt
justice and benevolence of human nature do not apply to the mobo-,bp7.txt

slaveholding community. What these habits are I have a right to,bp7.txt

THE LYNCHERS AND THE LYNCHED.,bp7.txt
"I repeat: The mistake made by those who, on this ground, object to",bp7.txt
"my theory of the charge against the Negro is, that they overlook the",bp7.txt
"natural effect and influence of the life, education, and habits of the",bp7.txt
"lynchers. We must remember that these people have not now, and",bp7.txt
"have never had, any such respect for human life as is common to other",bp7.txt
"men. They have had among them for centuries a peculiar institution,",bp7.txt
and that peculiar institution has stamped them as a peculiar people.,bp7.txt
"They were not before the War, they were not during the War, and",bp7.txt
"have not been since the War, in their spirit or in their civilization, a",bp7.txt
people in common with the people of the North. I will not here har-,bp7.txt
row up your feelings by detailing their treatment of Northern prisoners,bp7.txt
during the War. Their institutions have taught them no respect for,bp7.txt
"human life, and especially the life of the Negro. It has, in fact, taught",bp7.txt
them absolute contempt for his life. The sacredness of life which,bp7.txt
"ordinary men feel does not touch them anywhere. A dead Negro is,",bp7.txt
"with them, a common jest.",bp7.txt
They care no more for a Negro's right to live than they care for,bp7.txt

Not a breeze comes to us now from the late rebellious States that,bp7.txt

"We claim to be a Christian country and a highly civilized Nation,",bp7.txt

to surpass the blood-chilling horrors and fiendish excesses perpetrated,bp7.txt
against the colored people by the so-called enlightened and Christian,bp7.txt
people of the South. It is commonly thought that only the lowest,bp7.txt
"and most disgusting birds and beasts, such as buzzards, vultures, and",bp7.txt
"hyenas, will gloat over and prey upon dead bodies; but the Southern",bp7.txt

"Now, the special charge against the Negro by which this ferocity is",bp7.txt

"charge once fairly started, no matter by whom or in what manner,",bp7.txt
"whether well or ill founded, whether true or false, is certain to subject",bp7.txt
the accused to immediate death. It is nothing that in the case there,bp7.txt
may be a mistake as to identity. It is nothing that the victim pleads,bp7.txt
"""not guilty."" It is nothing that he only asks for time to establish his",bp7.txt
"innocence. It is nothing that the accused is of fair reputation, and his",bp7.txt

101,bp7.txt
THE CHRISTIAN EDUCATOR.,bp7.txt
"Of course I shall not be able to succeed in doing the impossible,",bp7.txt
but this one thing I can and will do. I can and will show that there,bp7.txt
are sound reasons for doubting and denying this horrible and hell-black,bp7.txt
charge of rape as the peculiar crime of the colored people of the,bp7.txt
South. My doubt and denial are based upon two fundamental and,bp7.txt
invincible grounds.,bp7.txt
100,bp7.txt
THE NATURAL PRESUMPTIVE EVIDENCE.,bp7.txt
The first is the well-established and well-tested character of the,bp7.txt
Negro on the very point upon which he is now violently and persist-,bp7.txt
ently accused. The second ground for my doubt and denial is based,bp7.txt
upon what I know of the character and antecedents of the men and,bp7.txt
women who bring this charge against him. I undertake to say that,bp7.txt
the strength of this position will become more manifest as I proceed,bp7.txt
with my argument.,bp7.txt
"At the outset I deny that a fierce and frenzied mob is, or ought",bp7.txt
"to be deemed, a competent witness against any man accused of any",bp7.txt
crime whatever. The ease with which a mob can be collected and the,bp7.txt
"slight causes by which it may be set in motion, and the elements of",bp7.txt
"which it is composed, deprive its testimony of the qualities that should",bp7.txt
inspire confidence and command belief. It is moved by impulses,bp7.txt
utterly unfavorable to an impartial statement of the truth. At the,bp7.txt
"outset, therefore, I challenge the credibility of the mob; and as the",bp7.txt
"mob is the main witness in the case against the Negro, I appeal to the",bp7.txt
common sense of mankind in support of my challenge. It is the mob,bp7.txt
"that brings this charge, and it is the mob that arraigns, condemns,",bp7.txt
"and executes, and it is the mob that the country has accepted as its",bp7.txt
witness.,bp7.txt
"Again, I impeach and discredit the veracity of Southern men gener-",bp7.txt
"ally, whether mobocrats or otherwise, who now openly and deliberately",bp7.txt
"nullify and violate the provisions of the Constitution of their country, a",bp7.txt
Constitution which they have solemnly sworn to support and execute.,bp7.txt
"I apply to them the legal maxim, ""False in one, false in all.""",bp7.txt
"Again, I arraign the Negro's accuser on another ground. I have",bp7.txt
no confidence in the truthfulness of men who justify themselves in,bp7.txt
cheating the Negro out of his Constitutional right to vote. The men,bp7.txt
"who, either by false returns or by taking advantage of his illiteracy, or",bp7.txt
surrounding the ballot-box with obstacles and sinuosities intended to,bp7.txt
"bewilder him and defeat his rightful exercise of the elective franchise,",bp7.txt
are men who are not to be believed on oath. That this is done in the,bp7.txt
"Southern States is not only admitted, but openly defended and justified",bp7.txt
by so-called honorable men inside and outside of Congress.,bp7.txt
THE CHRISTIAN EDUCATOR.,bp7.txt
"circumstances have made necessary a sterner, stronger, and more ef-",bp7.txt
"fective justification of Southern barbarism; and hence, according to",bp7.txt
"my theory, we now have to look into the face of a more shocking and",bp7.txt
"blasting charge than either Negro supremacy or insurrection, or that of",bp7.txt
murder itself.,bp7.txt
105,bp7.txt
"This new charge has come at the call of new conditions, and noth-",bp7.txt
ing could have been hit upon better calculated to accomplish its pur-,bp7.txt
pose. It clouds the character of the Negro with a crime the most re-,bp7.txt
"volting, and is fitted to drive from him all sympathy, and all fair play,",bp7.txt
and all mercy. It is a crime that places him outside of the pale of the,bp7.txt
"law, and settles upon his shoulders a mantle of wrath and fire that",bp7.txt
blisters and burns into his very soul.,bp7.txt
TO BLAST AND RUIN CHARACTER.,bp7.txt
"It is for this purpose, as I believe, that this new charge, unthought-",bp7.txt
"of in the times to which I have referred, has been largely invented, if",bp7.txt
not entirely trumped up. It is for this purpose that it has been con-,bp7.txt
stantly reiterated and adopted. It was to blast and ruin the Negro's,bp7.txt
character as a man and a citizen.,bp7.txt
I need not tell you how thoroughly it has already done its wonted,bp7.txt
work. You may feel its malign influence in the very air. You may,bp7.txt
read it in the faces of men. It has cooled our friends. It has,bp7.txt
"heated our enemies, and arrested in some measure the efforts that good",bp7.txt
men were wont to make for the colored man's improvement and ele-,bp7.txt
vation. It has deceived our friends at the North and many good,bp7.txt
friends at the South; for nearly all have in some measure accepted the,bp7.txt
charge as true. Its perpetual reiteration in our newspapers and maga-,bp7.txt
zines has led men and women to regard us with averted,bp7.txt
"ing hate, and dark suspicion.",bp7.txt
"eyes, increas-",bp7.txt
Some of the Southern papers have denounced me for my unbelief,bp7.txt
"in their new departure; but I repeat I do not believe it, and firmly",bp7.txt
"deny it. I reject it because I see in it evidence of an invention, called",bp7.txt
"into being by a well-defined motive, a motive sufficient to stamp it as",bp7.txt
gross expedient to justify murderous assault upon a long-enslaved and,bp7.txt
hence a hated people.,bp7.txt
"I do not believe it, because it bears on its face the marks of being",bp7.txt
"a makeshift for a malignant purpose. I reject it, not only because it",bp7.txt
was sprung upon the country simultaneously with well-known efforts,bp7.txt
now being industriously made to degrade the Negro by legislative en-,bp7.txt
"actments, and by repealing all laws for the protection of the ballot,",bp7.txt
and by drawing the color-line in all railroad cars and stations and in,bp7.txt
all other public places in the South; but because I see in it a means,bp7.txt
of paving the way for our entire disfranchisement.,bp7.txt

the product and regulate the price of a staple in constant demand,bp7.txt
among every people on the globe.,bp7.txt

In the closing and more embittered period of the political struggle,bp7.txt
"over the question of slavery, public opinion in the South grew narrow",bp7.txt
and cruel. The mass of the Southern people refused to see anything,bp7.txt
in the anti-slavery movement except fanaticism; they classed Abolition-,bp7.txt

ATROCIOUS CRIME ALLEGED.,bp7.txt
The crime they allege against the Negro is the most revolting which,bp7.txt
men can commit. It is a crime that awakens the intensest abhorrence,bp7.txt
"and invites mankind to kill the criminal on sight. This charge, thus",bp7.txt
"brought against the Negro, and as constantly reiterated by his enemies,",bp7.txt
"is not merely against the individual culprit, as would be in the case with",bp7.txt
"an individual culprit of any other race, but it is in a large measure a",bp7.txt
charge against the colored race as such. It throws over every colored,bp7.txt
"man a mantle of odium, and sets upon him a mark for popular hate",bp7.txt
more distressing than the mark set upon the first murderer. It points,bp7.txt
THE CHRISTIAN EDUCATOR.,bp7.txt
"Any pretense that a guilty Negro, especially one guilty of the crime",bp7.txt

"You will remember, also, that during this time the justification for",bp7.txt
"the murder of Negroes was said to be Negro conspiracies, insurrections,",bp7.txt
"schemes to murder all the white people, to burn the town, and commit",bp7.txt
violence generally. These were the excuses then depended upon; but,bp7.txt
never a word was then said or whispered about Negro outrages upon,bp7.txt
white women and children. So far as the history of that time is con-,bp7.txt
"cerned, white women and children were absolutely safe, and husbands",bp7.txt
and fathers could leave home without the slightest anxiety on account,bp7.txt
of their families.,bp7.txt
"But when events proved that no such conspiracies, no such insur-",bp7.txt
"rections as were then pretended to exist, and were paraded before the",bp7.txt

"denied the exercise of the commonest rights of humanity, and regarded",bp7.txt
"by the ruling class in that section as outside of the Government, out-",bp7.txt

"I have waited patiently, but anxiously, to see the end of the epi-",bp7.txt
demic of mob law and persecution now prevailing at the South. But,bp7.txt
the indications are not hopeful. Great and terrible as have been its,bp7.txt
"ravages in the past, it now seems to be increasing, not only in the",bp7.txt
"number of its victims, but in its frantic rage and savage extrava-",bp7.txt
gance. Lawless vengeance is beginning to be visited upon white men,bp7.txt
as well as black. Our newspapers are daily disfigured by its ghastly,bp7.txt
"horrors. It is no longer local, but national; no longer confined to the",bp7.txt
"South, but has invaded the North. The contagion is spreading, ex-",bp7.txt

"if permitted to go on, it threatens to destroy all respect for law and",bp7.txt
"order, not only in the South, but in all parts of our country, North",bp7.txt
as well as South. For certain it is that crime allowed to go on unre-,bp7.txt
sisted and unarrested will breed crime. When the poison of anarchy,bp7.txt
"is once in the air, like the pestilence that walketh in the darkness,",bp7.txt
the winds of heaven will take it up and favor its diffusion. Though,bp7.txt

to kill on the ground that it was necessary to check the domination and,bp7.txt
"supremacy of the Negro, and to secure the absolute rule of the Anglo-",bp7.txt
Saxon race.,bp7.txt
It is important to notice that there have been three distinct periods,bp7.txt
"of persecution of Negroes in the South, and three distinct sets of ex-",bp7.txt
cuses for persecution. They have come along precisely in the order in,bp7.txt
which they were most needed. First you remember it was insurrec-,bp7.txt
"tion. When that was worn out, Negro supremacy became the excuse.",bp7.txt
"When that is worn out, now it is assault upon defenseless women. I",bp7.txt
"undertake to say that this order and periodicity is significant, and",bp7.txt
"means something, and should not be overlooked. And now that",bp7.txt
Negro supremacy and Negro domination are no longer defensible as,bp7.txt
"an excuse for Negro persecutions, there has come in due course this",bp7.txt
heart-rending cry about the white women and little white children of,bp7.txt
the South.,bp7.txt
104,bp7.txt
EVIDENT EXPLANATION.,bp7.txt
"Now, I ask what is the rational explanation of this singular",bp7.txt
omission of this charge in the two periods preceding the present?,bp7.txt
Why was not the charge made at that time as now? The Negro,bp7.txt
was the same then as to-day. White women and children were,bp7.txt
the same then as to-day. Temptations to wrong doing were the,bp7.txt
"same then as to-day. Why, then, was not this dreadful charge",bp7.txt
"brought forward against the Negro in war times, and why was it not",bp7.txt
brought forward in reconstruction times?,bp7.txt
"I will tell you; or you, yourselves, have already answered the",bp7.txt
"question. The only rational answer is, that there was no foundation",bp7.txt
"for such a charge, or that the charge itself was either not thought of",bp7.txt
or was not deemed necessary to excuse the lawless violence with which,bp7.txt
the Negro was then pursued and killed. The old charges already,bp7.txt
enumerated were deemed all-sufficient. This new charge has now,bp7.txt
swallowed up,bp7.txt
"all the old ones, and the reason is obvious.",bp7.txt
"Things have changed since then; old excuses were not available,",bp7.txt
and the Negro's accusers have found it necessary to change with them.,bp7.txt
The old charges are no longer valid. Upon them the good opinion,bp7.txt
of the North and of mankind can not be secured. Honest men no,bp7.txt
longer believe in the wornout stories of insurrection. They no,bp7.txt
longer believe that there is just ground to apprehend Negro su-,bp7.txt
premacy. Time and events have swept away these old refuges of lies.,bp7.txt
and,bp7.txt
"They did their work in their day, and did it with terrible energy",bp7.txt
effect; but they are now cast aside as useless. The altered times and,bp7.txt
THE CHRISTIAN EDUCATOR.,bp7.txt
"him out as an object of suspicion and avoidance. Now, it is in this",bp7.txt
"form that you and I, and all of us, are required to meet it and refute",bp7.txt
"it, if that can be done. In the opinion of some of us it is thought",bp7.txt
that it were well to say nothing about it; that the least said about it,bp7.txt
the better. In this opinion I do not concur. Taking this charge in,bp7.txt
"the broad and comprehensive sense in which it is presented, and as now",bp7.txt
"stated, I feel that it ought to be met, and, as a colored man,",bp7.txt
I am,bp7.txt
grateful for the opportunity now afforded me to meet it. For I believe,bp7.txt
"it can be met, and successfully met. I am of opinion that a people",bp7.txt
too spiritless to defend themselves are not worth defending.,bp7.txt
99,bp7.txt
"Without boasting, on this broad issue, as now presented, I am",bp7.txt
"ready to confront Ex-Governor Chamberlain, Bishop Fitzgerald, Bishop",bp7.txt
"Haygood, and Miss Frances Willard, and all others, singly or all to-",bp7.txt
"gether, without any doubt of the result.",bp7.txt
But I want to be understood at the outset. I do not pretend that,bp7.txt
Negroes are saints or angels. I do not deny that they are capable of,bp7.txt
"committing the crime imputed to them, but I utterly deny that they",bp7.txt
are any more addicted to the commission of that crime than is true of,bp7.txt
any other variety of the human family. In entering upon my argu-,bp7.txt
"ment, I may be allowed to say that I appear not as the defender of",bp7.txt
"any man guilty of this atrocious crime, but as the defender of the",bp7.txt
colored people as a class.,bp7.txt
HUMANE AND CHRISTIAN DEFENSE.,bp7.txt
"In answer to the terrible indictment thus read, and speaking for",bp7.txt
"the colored people as a class, I, in their stead, here and now plead",bp7.txt
"not guilty, and shall submit my case with confidence of acquittal by",bp7.txt
good men and women North and South.,bp7.txt
It is the misfortune of the colored people in this country that the,bp7.txt
sins of the few are visited upon the many; and I am here to speak for,bp7.txt
"the many, whose reputation is put in peril by the sweeping charge in",bp7.txt
"question. With General Grant, and every other honest man, my motto",bp7.txt
"is: ""Let no guilty man escape."" But while I say this, I also say,",bp7.txt
"Let no innocent man be condemned and killed by the mob, or",bp7.txt
crushed under the weight of a charge of which he is not guilty.,bp7.txt
You will readily see that the cause I have undertaken to support,bp7.txt
is not to be maintained by any mere confident assertions or general,bp7.txt
"denials. If I had no better ground to stand upon than this, I would",bp7.txt
leave the field of controversy and give up the colored man's cause at,bp7.txt
"once to his able accusers. I am aware, however, that I am here to do",bp7.txt
in some measure what the masters of logic say can not be done-prove,bp7.txt
a negative.,bp7.txt
108,bp7.txt
THE CHRISTIAN EDUCATOR.,bp7.txt
consider that the black man had any rights which the white men were,bp7.txt
"bound to respect."" No man of the South ever called in question that",bp7.txt
"statement, and they never will. They could always shoot, stab, and",bp7.txt
burn the Negro without any such remorse or shame as other men would,bp7.txt
feel after committing such a crime. Any Southern man who is honest,bp7.txt
and is frank enough to talk on the subject will tell you that he has no,bp7.txt
"such idea as we have of the sacredness of human life, and especially,",bp7.txt
"as I have said, of the life of the Negro. Hence it is absurd to meet",bp7.txt
my arguments with the facts predicated of our common human nature.,bp7.txt
LET JUSTICE BE DONE THOUGH THE HEAVENS FALL.,bp7.txt
I know I shall be charged with apologizing for criminals. Ex-,bp7.txt
Governor Chamberlain has already virtually done as much. But there,bp7.txt
is no foundation for any such charge. I affirm that neither I nor any,bp7.txt
"other colored man of like standing with myself, has ever raised a",bp7.txt
finger or uttered a word in defense of any one really guilty of the,bp7.txt
dreadful crime now in question.,bp7.txt
"But what I contend for, and what every honest man, black or",bp7.txt
"white, should contend for, is, that when any man is accused of this or",bp7.txt
"any other crime, of whatever name, nature, or extent, he shall have",bp7.txt
the benefit of a legal investigation; that he shall be confronted by his,bp7.txt
"accusers; and that he shall, through proper counsel, be able to question",bp7.txt
"his accusers in open court and in open daylight, so that his guilt or his",bp7.txt
innocence may be duly proved and established.,bp7.txt
"If this is to make me liable to the charge of apologizing for crime,",bp7.txt
I am not ashamed to be so charged. I dare to contend for the colored,bp7.txt
people of the United States that they are a law-abiding people; and I,bp7.txt
"dare to insist upon it that they, or any man, black or white, accused",bp7.txt
"of crime, shall have a fair trial before he is punished.",bp7.txt
BLAINE ON SLAVERY AND THE SOUTH.,bp7.txt
THE slaves in the United States numbered about seven hundred,bp7.txt
thousand when Washington's Administration was organized. They,bp7.txt
had increased to four millions when Lincoln was chosen President.,bp7.txt
Their number in 1860 was less in proportion to the white population,bp7.txt
than it was in 1789. The immigration of whites had changed the,bp7.txt
ratio. But the more marked and important change had been in the,bp7.txt
value of slave-labor. In 1789 the slaves produced little or no sur-,bp7.txt
"plus, and in many States were regarded as a burden. In 1860 they",bp7.txt
produced a surplus of at least three hundred millions of dollars.,bp7.txt

"The Negroes, therefore, undoubtedly",bp8.txt

and tired in a white regiment.,bp8.txt
longside of the honorable army who,bp8.txt
"once saved the Union, were posted",bp8.txt
young ladies from the best society of,bp8.txt
"Boston, who offered the veterans",bp8.txt
"cold water to drink, which was indeed",bp8.txt
a welcome refreshment to the march-,bp8.txt
ing soldiers. All the white comrades,bp8.txt
"had already been administered to,",bp8.txt

eran. Once he was good enough to,bp8.txt
bleed for a country which had allow-,bp8.txt
"ed shackles to be put on his feet, but",bp8.txt
now he was not worthy of a drink of,bp8.txt
water. He looked sore and worn out.,bp8.txt
At last a young lady stepped forward,bp8.txt
and offered him a glass of water. I,bp8.txt
never saw a face undergo such a,bp8.txt
change as now did that of the old,bp8.txt
veteran. In a moment he was all,bp8.txt
sunshine. Every muscle and fibre in,bp8.txt
that black image was bright with,bp8.txt
smile and joy. And the smile did,bp8.txt
not cease. It remained there like a,bp8.txt
sunshine on a dark clould. I followed,bp8.txt
"him for a quarter of an hour,and still",bp8.txt
the smile was on his face and in his,bp8.txt

"(Twentieth Century, New York, Sept. 8)",bp8.txt
in,bp8.txt
It seems to me not to be altogether,bp8.txt
out of place for me to make a few,bp8.txt
comments on the race problem,bp8.txt
this country. Born and educated in,bp8.txt
Europe I may perhaps not be able to,bp8.txt
view this question from the same,bp8.txt
"standpoint as native Americans, and",bp8.txt
perhaps not even have a right to,bp8.txt
meddle with it. But at the same,bp8.txt
time I think that my being a stranger,bp8.txt
enables me to look at this problem,bp8.txt
"with dispassionate eyes, which will",bp8.txt
help me to do justice to the parties,bp8.txt
"involved. However that may be, I",bp8.txt
"beg leave to say what I think, having",bp8.txt
paid some attention to the subject,bp8.txt
during several years.,bp8.txt
Europe has been and still is vexed,bp8.txt
by race problems. None of them is,bp8.txt
solved. But there races about equal,bp8.txt
in education and intelligence live,bp8.txt
"side by side in the same community,",bp8.txt
with the same rights under the same,bp8.txt
government. They tolerate each,bp8.txt
"other, that's all. But where the",bp8.txt
"races are very much different, as the",bp8.txt
"case is with the Jews, even tolerance",bp8.txt
cannot always be maintained.,bp8.txt
"wars, then, still occur. As far as I",bp8.txt
"know, there is only one instance in",bp8.txt
Europe of an inferior race living in,bp8.txt
the same country as a superior one,bp8.txt
The Laps in Northern Europe are,bp8.txt
"nomads, or only half civilized.",bp8.txt
"they, as their kinsfolk, the Chinese",bp8.txt
"are quiet and retired, and give no",bp8.txt
cause for serious troubles.,bp8.txt
Race,bp8.txt
But,bp8.txt
The colored race in this country is,bp8.txt
essentially different from any race,bp8.txt
in Europe. The colored people are,bp8.txt
"a progressive people, capable of de-",bp8.txt
"velopement, and fitted to become",bp8.txt
civilized. At the same time they,bp8.txt
"have their race peculiarities, and are",bp8.txt
neither physically nor mentally,bp8.txt
evolved from the state of savagery.,bp8.txt
But it is only a question of time,bp8.txt
when they will be. The white races,bp8.txt
have gone through the same process,bp8.txt
of evolution though under different,bp8.txt
conditions.,bp8.txt
Some time ago I lived in a State,bp8.txt
where the colored people contributed,bp8.txt
a large proportion to the population.,bp8.txt
I took pains to see how they lived,bp8.txt
and how they were getting along.,bp8.txt
At an average they were in about,bp8.txt
the same state as the poor people in,bp8.txt
the large cities of Europe. They,bp8.txt
were neither more poor nor more,bp8.txt
morally degraded or ignorant. The,bp8.txt
only difference I could notice was,bp8.txt
undoubtedly due to racial and cli-,bp8.txt
matic conditions. Their sexual in-,bp8.txt
"clinations are strong, no doubt, but",bp8.txt
such is the case with all people liv-,bp8.txt
ing in a hot climate. White men,bp8.txt
very much oftener committed rape,bp8.txt
on colored girls than colored men,bp8.txt
were guilty of the same crime to-,bp8.txt
ward white women. But invariably,bp8.txt
"the colored rapist was lynched, but",bp8.txt
not the white one. And neverthe-,bp8.txt
"less, the crime of the latter was",bp8.txt
"greater than that of the former one,",bp8.txt
"For, leaving out of the question the",bp8.txt
fact that slavery was demoralizing,bp8.txt
to the colored people in this very,bp8.txt
"respect, not only the law, but also",bp8.txt
the public opinion of our people re-,bp8.txt
LYNCHINE,bp8.txt
gards crimes toward inferiors a,bp8.txt
greater offenses than crimes toward,bp8.txt
equals. If a white man commits,bp8.txt
"rape on a child, he is punished",bp8.txt
more severely than if his victim had,bp8.txt
"been a full grown woman, which, un-",bp8.txt
"doubtedly, is just, too. Why, then,",bp8.txt
should we make an exception if the,bp8.txt
inferior victim has a black skin?,bp8.txt
"And on the contrary, an inferior",bp8.txt
criminal is not as a rule punished as,bp8.txt
hard as one of higher mental devel-,bp8.txt
"opment, because the responsibility is",bp8.txt
"not the same, Why, then, should",bp8.txt
the Negro be excepted from that,bp8.txt
rule? It seems to me that a formida-,bp8.txt
ble injustice is committed to the,bp8.txt
"lynched colored rapist or criminal,",bp8.txt
for the punishment always ought to,bp8.txt
be proportionate to the responsi-,bp8.txt
bility.,bp8.txt
But the negro problem is a grave,bp8.txt
"one indeed, and it has to be solved or",bp8.txt
"serious troubles may ensue, resulting",bp8.txt
in moral degradation to both parties,bp8.txt
and perhaps to the forming of a,bp8.txt
State within the State by the ex-,bp8.txt
cluded Negro. But how can this,bp8.txt
problem be solved satisfactorily?,bp8.txt
It seems to me that we cannot ex-,bp8.txt
"pect a perfect solution, for different",bp8.txt
races always will be antagonistic to,bp8.txt
each other. The highest goal we can,bp8.txt
aim at is to make the two races toler-,bp8.txt
"ate each other, for we never will get",bp8.txt
"beyond that. And meanwhile, let",bp8.txt
the white people deal justly with the,bp8.txt
colored race and try to educate the,bp8.txt
"coming generations. Education, in-",bp8.txt
"deed, is the capital means for the ele-",bp8.txt
vation of the ex-slave and his chil-,bp8.txt
dren. But not so much the education,bp8.txt
of schools and colleges as the educa-,bp8.txt
tion of life. I would not claim social,bp8.txt
recognition for the Negro now and at,bp8.txt
"once,but certainly it should be accord-",bp8.txt
"ed to him as soon as he deserves it,",bp8.txt
for else he will be kept back and his,bp8.txt
progress stopped. A colored Baptist,bp8.txt
"minster once said to me: ""What is",bp8.txt
the use of the Negro getting educated,bp8.txt
and graduating from a college or a,bp8.txt
"high school, for the only way open to",bp8.txt
"him is this."" Saying so, he pointed",bp8.txt
to a gang of colored men who were,bp8.txt
busy with grading a street. I have,bp8.txt
conversed with Negroes who were,bp8.txt
just as intelligent and who behaved,bp8.txt
"just as nicely as any white person, and",bp8.txt
have even been superior to the aver-,bp8.txt
"age white man, and I do not see why",bp8.txt
the color of the skin should exclude,bp8.txt
such a man from the company of his,bp8.txt
white equals ar even superiors. An,bp8.txt
educated and noble-minded Negro is,bp8.txt
not more of a savage than the Presi-,bp8.txt
dent of the United States. The Ne-,bp8.txt
gro has many qualities which are apt,bp8.txt
"to make him, when educated and re-",bp8.txt
"fined, a pleasant companion in any",bp8.txt
society. I think that especially his,bp8.txt
musical genius is a quality which in,bp8.txt
the future will make his people ac-,bp8.txt
ceptable anywhere. Another way of,bp8.txt
educating the Negro is using him as,bp8.txt
a servant in our families. He then,bp8.txt
will be brought in constant contact,bp8.txt
with the white people and certainly,bp8.txt
will gain by it.,bp8.txt
I do not think the colored race will,bp8.txt
ever be extinet or unite with the,bp8.txt
white race. If the population of,bp8.txt
America had been principally made,bp8.txt
"up of French and Germans, such",bp8.txt
might have been the fate of the color-,bp8.txt
"ed people, but the Angle-Saxon race",bp8.txt
never mixes with other races. We,bp8.txt

was shot and killed in the bank building,87668_1.txt
about 1 o'clock yesterday afternoon by,87668_1.txt
Thomas J. Riley.,87668_1.txt
Riley entered the bank five or ten minutes,87668_1.txt
before committing the bloody act.,87668_1.txt
He called Largey to the cashier's window,87668_1.txt
and the two talked for five minutes,87668_1.txt
or more. They were conversing in ordinary,87668_1.txt
"tones, and there was nothing to indicate",87668_1.txt
that their talk was otherwise than,87668_1.txt
friendly. Suddenly Riley drew a gun and,87668_1.txt
shot through the window at Largey. The,87668_1.txt
bullet struck the latter in the left arm,87668_1.txt
and shattered the bone. Largey stooped,87668_1.txt
"down, and had he continued in that position",87668_1.txt
"he might have escaped with his life,",87668_1.txt
as he was protected by the counter. However,87668_1.txt
", he rose partly, and as he did so Riley",87668_1.txt
fired a second shot. The bullet struck Mr.,87668_1.txt
Largey squarely in the forehead and he,87668_1.txt
fell over on the floor dead.,87668_1.txt
The murderer started for the front door,87668_1.txt
on Park street. As he passed the teller's,87668_1.txt
window he took a shot at those behind,87668_1.txt
the railing. The bullet narrowly missed,87668_1.txt
"Frank Holmes, one of the clerks, dug a",87668_1.txt
hole in his desk and went through a glass,87668_1.txt
in one of the windows on the Main street,87668_1.txt
side of the building. Riley then rushed,87668_1.txt
"out of the Park street door, thrusting his",87668_1.txt
pistol into his pocket as he did so.,87668_1.txt
Assassin Was Captured.,87668_1.txt

"on January 15, 1895, and has since worn",87668_1.txt
a cork leg.,87668_1.txt
Grew Out of an Explosion.,87668_1.txt
Largey was the manager of one of the,87668_1.txt
companies whose warehouses exploded and,87668_1.txt
caused the loss of 58 lives. In contradiction,87668_1.txt
to his statement that Largey refused,87668_1.txt
"to help him, it is a well known fact",87668_1.txt
that the banker frequently helped him. He,87668_1.txt
secured employment for him a number of,87668_1.txt
"times, but Riley was unable to hold a",87668_1.txt
"position any length of time. Besides,",87668_1.txt
Largey occasionally supplied him with,87668_1.txt
money.,87668_1.txt
It is asserted that the killing was the,87668_1.txt
result of a conspiracy or understanding to,87668_1.txt
murder more than one man who had managerial,87668_1.txt
or proprietary interests in the two,87668_1.txt
warehouses that were the scene of the explosions,87668_1.txt

to twenty years' imprisonment. Even,87672_0.txt
this did not satisfy the public demand,87672_0.txt
and before he could be committed to,87672_0.txt
the penitentiary the jail was besieged,87672_0.txt
by an angry mob. A militia company,87672_0.txt
was called out to protect the prisoner,87672_0.txt
"and fired into the crowd, killing three",87672_0.txt
and wounding several. Resistance,87672_0.txt

hanging. When the offense is especially,87672_0.txt
loathsome the people take the law,87672_0.txt

THAT OWENSBORO OUTRAGE.,87679_1.txt
The lynching of the negro Holt at,87679_1.txt
Owensboro Saturday morning was,87679_1.txt
without justification or excuse.,87679_1.txt
Heretofore it has been the plea advanced,87679_1.txt
in favor of mob violence,87679_1.txt
that the of the law is,87679_1.txt
progress too,87679_1.txt
"slow and uncertain, that"" the best",87679_1.txt
"plan is the surest plan,"" etc. But in",87679_1.txt
the present instance no such excuse,87679_1.txt
was available. The trial of the prisoner,87679_1.txt
was in progress and was being,87679_1.txt
pushed with all possible celerity consistent,87679_1.txt
with a full development of,87679_1.txt
the facts. It was conceded by every,87679_1.txt
body at all conversant with the case,87679_1.txt
that the death penalty would be the,87679_1.txt
result But in interim,87679_1.txt
. the,87679_1.txt
between,87679_1.txt
the charging of the jury and their,87679_1.txt
"deliberations in the case, the prisoner",87679_1.txt
"was taken out by a"" mob"" of",87679_1.txt
less than twenty men and hanged to a,87679_1.txt
"tree, within a stone's toss of the",87679_1.txt
tribunal of justice wherein it is guaranteed,87679_1.txt
that men's lives and liberties,87679_1.txt
are guarded and preserved with all,87679_1.txt
possible caution and decrees rendered,87679_1.txt
with the clearest sense of justice.,87679_1.txt
And thus is a terrible outrage,87679_1.txt
"perpetrated upon the court, justice",87679_1.txt
has been mocked in her deliberations,87679_1.txt
and another shameful blot cast upon,87679_1.txt
the otherwise fair name of Ken.,87679_1.txt
tucky. A crime without the shadow,87679_1.txt
of an excuse. An outrage as,87679_1.txt
senseless in conception as it was,87679_1.txt
ghastly and cruel in execution.,87679_1.txt
There is some needed remedy in,87679_1.txt
in this matter of mobs- badly needed.,87679_1.txt
Since the above deplorable occurrence,87679_1.txt
it is evident that mobs do not,87679_1.txt
always rely upon slow justice and,87679_1.txt
incapable administration of the law,87679_1.txt
as an excuse for their wanton outrages,87679_1.txt
. They seem to be controlled,87679_1.txt
by an infernal spirit of murder that,87679_1.txt
brooks no reason or restraint. The,87679_1.txt
fact that the object of their vengeance,87679_1.txt
is surely receiving the just,87679_1.txt
merits for his crime does not influence,87679_1.txt
their ideas of justice nor check their,87679_1.txt
wild haste to murder a helpless pris-,87679_1.txt
one.,87679_1.txt
The question of a remedy for,87679_1.txt
these deplorable occurrences should,87679_1.txt
be paramount to all others until an,87679_1.txt
effective law is passed that will stop,87679_1.txt
their bold progress. This law should,87679_1.txt

"assaulted, in day light, at",87826_0.txt
was criminally,87826_0.txt
"her home in this city, near the court",87826_0.txt
house. Mrs. Gaumer was prostrated. She,87826_0.txt
felt the disgrace and requested her son,87826_0.txt
to announcet hat she was assaulted for,87826_0.txt
robbery. It was given out that Mitchell,87826_0.txt
attempted to force her to sign a check,87826_0.txt
for$ 500. But as Mrs. Gaumer's condition,87826_0.txt
became more sérious the facts became,87826_0.txt
known and also that the negro was,87826_0.txt
afflicted with a loathsome disease. Mitch-,87826_0.txt
"ell was first held for robbery, but on last",87826_0.txt
Wednesday he was arraigned for criminal,87826_0.txt
assault. Mrs. Gaumer was unable to,87826_0.txt
"appear in court, and the hearing was",87826_0.txt
held at her home. As Mitchell entered,87826_0.txt
her room she raised up in bed and ex-,87826_0.txt
How,87826_0.txt
"claimed:"" The brute, hang him.",87826_0.txt
"dare you face me again you brute.""",87826_0.txt
Soon after the identification on Wed-,87826_0.txt
nesday there was talk of lynching.,87826_0.txt
Crowds surrounded the jail that night and,87826_0.txt
the sheriff and local militia had trouble,87826_0.txt
"in protecting the prisoner. Yesterday,",87826_0.txt
a grand jury was impannelled and it soon,87826_0.txt
returned an indictment for criminal assault,87826_0.txt
". Mitchell, disguised in a soldier's",87826_0.txt
"uniform, was brought last night from jail",87826_0.txt
into court. He waived the reading of the,87826_0.txt
"indictment, plead giulty and was prompt-",87826_0.txt
sentenced to twenty years in the peni-,87826_0.txt
"tiary, the limit for criminal assault.",87826_0.txt
trial was over before nine o'clock,87826_0.txt
"night, when an attempt was made to",87826_0.txt
Mitchell to Columbus on the train,87826_0.txt
p. m. But the crowds were about,87826_0.txt
urt house and jail and when the,87826_0.txt
"drove up, the crowd made a",87826_0.txt
the jail. The military drove,87826_0.txt
"back, but the crowd soon in-",87826_0.txt
"e n fury as well as numbers, so",87826_0.txt
that Sheriff McLean and the troops had,87826_0.txt
"all they could do to hold the jail, and",87826_0.txt
the trip to Columbus was given up before,87826_0.txt
the departure of the last train.,87826_0.txt
It was 1:30 a. m. when the first attack,87826_0.txt
was made on the jail. The soldiers opened,87826_0.txt
fire on the mob and twenty volleys,87826_0.txt
were poured into the advancing crowd.,87826_0.txt
Two were killed and nine wounded. The,87826_0.txt
attacking party retired but the sight of,87826_0.txt
the dead and injured infuriated them and,87826_0.txt
the crowd soon rallied.,87826_0.txt
The final attack on the jail was made,87826_0.txt
at 7 o'clock this morning. The local company,87826_0.txt
", which did the shooting, had been",87826_0.txt
on duty for two nights and a request was,87826_0.txt
sent to Governor Bushnell for reinforcements,87826_0.txt
. He ordered a company from,87826_0.txt
Springfield to the scene and they arrived,87826_0.txt
before 7 o'clock. Mayor Ganzon met the,87826_0.txt
"soldiers and sent them back to the depot,",87826_0.txt
were not wanted. The,87826_0.txt
saying that they,87826_0.txt
local company was also withdrawn from,87826_0.txt
"the jail about this time. The mob, which",87826_0.txt
had in numbers at,87826_0.txt
grown,87826_0.txt
the,87826_0.txt
"the break of day, seeing",87826_0.txt
secured a large sledge,87826_0.txt
"way open,",87826_0.txt
hammer and started for the jail. The,87826_0.txt
"hammer was not needed, as Sheriff Me-",87826_0.txt
Lain delivered the keys and the crowd,87826_0.txt
Mitchell's ell.,87826_0.txt
soon found,87826_0.txt
A rope was thrown around the negro's,87826_0.txt
neck and he was dragged out. When the,87826_0.txt
"outer door was reached the noose slipped,",87826_0.txt
but it was soon replaced and the condemned,87826_0.txt
man was hurried into the yard.,87826_0.txt
The rope was then thrown over one of,87826_0.txt
the limbs of a tree. Mitchell was jerked,87826_0.txt
up until his head struck the limb. His,87826_0.txt
neck was broken and his body dropped to,87826_0.txt
the ground. The crowd repeated the jerking,87826_0.txt
several times until they were sure,87826_0.txt
he was dead. There is some doubt as to,87826_0.txt
what occurred inside the jail from midnight,87826_0.txt
until the time of the lynching. The,87826_0.txt
"facts, as near as can be arrived at, are as",87826_0.txt
follows:,87826_0.txt
When the first attack was made on the,87826_0.txt
mounted,87826_0.txt
jail at 1:30 a. m. a dozen men,87826_0.txt
the rear step and two of them used a,87826_0.txt
sledge hammer on the doors. The local,87826_0.txt
militia company was under arms on the,87826_0.txt
inside with Sheriff McLain and his deputies,87826_0.txt
. Capt. George W. Leonard stepped,87826_0.txt
"out and said:"" I will give you three minutes",87826_0.txt
to disperse. If you do not do so I,87826_0.txt
"must fire.""",87826_0.txt
The crowd generally believed that Sheriff,87826_0.txt
McLain had already ordered the troops,87826_0.txt
to fire and they dispersed. But when the,87826_0.txt
attack was renewed on the rear door of,87826_0.txt
"the jail with sledge hammers, the firing",87826_0.txt
"took place and the crowd dispersed,",87826_0.txt
leaving their dead and wounded. It was,87826_0.txt
after three o'clock when Sheriff McLain,87826_0.txt
"telegraphed Governor Bushnell, at Woos-",87826_0.txt
"ter, Ohio, that a mob had attacked the",87826_0.txt
"jail, that he had opened fire, that his",87826_0.txt
force was inadequate and that assist-,87826_0.txt
ance was needed at once.,87826_0.txt
The colored people are greatly excited,87826_0.txt
over the affair. They had previously met,87826_0.txt
and adopted resolutions for the punish-,87826_0.txt
"ment of Mitchell, but many of them",87826_0.txt
talked about him not being guilty. Women,87826_0.txt
"children, as well as a multitude of men,",87826_0.txt
witnessed the lyching. There was no attempt,87826_0.txt
at disguise or secrecy. An hour or,87826_0.txt
"more after the lynching, Mitchell's body",87826_0.txt
was picked up and placed in a rough,87826_0.txt
"coffin, but left under the tree, where",87826_0.txt
hundreds of people continued to view it.,87826_0.txt
Later in the day the body was removed,87826_0.txt
by the coroner and other traces of the violence,87826_0.txt
were removed as fast as possible.,87826_0.txt
"Meantime, crowds of people poured into",87826_0.txt
the city from all surrounding towns and,87826_0.txt
viewed the blood stained steps of the jail,87826_0.txt
and the marks of the bullets on the surrounding,87826_0.txt
houses. Among the sights shown,87826_0.txt
visitors was a tree in the same court,87826_0.txt
house yard where a man named Ullery,87826_0.txt
"was lynched twenty- three years ago, for",87826_0.txt

Governor Bushnell arrived here tonight,87826_0.txt
investigate the trouble and,87826_0.txt
to,87826_0.txt
especially the action of the troops. While,87826_0.txt
the Urbana company is overwhelmed,87826_0.txt
with local sentiment against their ac-,87826_0.txt
"tion, they are also liable for abandoning",87826_0.txt
their post of duty. Capt. Leonard with-,87826_0.txt
"drew the guards about 7 a. m., and the",87826_0.txt
Springfield company took orders from the,87826_0.txt
"mayor instead of the sheriff, when they",87826_0.txt
turned back from the court house.,87826_0.txt
Governor Bushnell was attending an,87826_0.txt
encampment at Woodster last night and,87826_0.txt
was met by a delegation from here on his,87826_0.txt
return to Columbus this afternoon. The,87826_0.txt
citizens asked for protection by troops of,87826_0.txt
Sheriff McLain against whose life threats,87826_0.txt
had been freely made during the after-,87826_0.txt
"noon, and if he was here tonight it is",87826_0.txt
believed there would be trouble again.,87826_0.txt
Sheriff McLain left here at 8 p. m. and,87826_0.txt
"arrived at Springfield at 3 p. m., en",87826_0.txt
route to Dayton. He escaped by the,87826_0.txt
back door of the jail and claims that,87826_0.txt
dynamite was being prepared to blow,87826_0.txt
him up. In the excitement and bitterness,87826_0.txt
that prevails tonight it is almost impossible,87826_0.txt
to get at the facts as to the responsibility,87826_0.txt
"for the loss of life, but it is generally",87826_0.txt
claimed that Sheriff McLain ordered,87826_0.txt
the troops to fire.,87826_0.txt
It is believed there will be a thorough,87826_0.txt
investigation into the action of he mayor,87826_0.txt
as well as into the action of the sheriff,87826_0.txt
and military officers.,87826_0.txt

daylight that there would be no more,87826_0.txt

a fitting punishment for any crime,87863_1.txt
outside of the one indicated above,87863_1.txt

deseryed. The lynching of a negro,87863_2.txt
in Cleveland county last Monday,87863_2.txt

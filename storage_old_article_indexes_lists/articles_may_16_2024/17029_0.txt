money was found except the upper part of a
bill of exchange for$ 1476, drawn by Messrs.
Perkins, Campbell& Co., of New Orleans.
Five of the men arrested were condemned
by a verdict of the passengers to be severely
whipped, and the sentence was carried into et-

lacerated by former floggings. horribly

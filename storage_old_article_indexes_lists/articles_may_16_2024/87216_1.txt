was strong, but was weakened by the fiasco
of a detective's evidence. Although Young
was acquitted, belief was very decided among

him. Sunday afternoon, Oct. 26, Young mar-
ried Lydia Bray of Ohio, and on Monday, eve-
ning, Oct. 27, the couple arrived in Kahoka,
before going to Young's hom√© at Luray. As
their train passed through Kahoka this morn-
ing, Young and his wife alighted' and a mob
of 100 to 200 men followed them on horseback
and in
wagons and surrounded his house. On
demand of his surrender, Young opened fire
on the mob, and shots were exchanged until
he was wounded Eight men then forced their
into the house took him out and
way, hung
him. The excitement there is intense No

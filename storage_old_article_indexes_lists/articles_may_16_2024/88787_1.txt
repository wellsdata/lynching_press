NEGRO LYNCHED AT FRED-
ERICK, MARYLAND.
Prison Doors Forced with Sledges and
Crowbars in Quick Order- The Victim
Identified the Assailant of Lillie
Jones, a White as Woman.
The mob during the process of lynching
observed order; none were allowed
to fire at him except one.
A member of the mob made a brief
speech, in which he said that they
were there with the unfortunate
wretch, not in a spirit of malice, but
to make an example of him, and teach
his race that they must let the women
of Frederick county alone.
The assault for which Goings suffered
death was a cruel and dastardly
one. Miss Jones has thirteen cuts and
stab wounds on her body where he
hacked at her with a knife and razor.
She says he asked her for something to
eat, and, when she gave it to him,
said: he
" I will give you a dollar." She
screamed and ran fifty feet down the
garden, where he overtook her, knocking
her down, and cut her, also crushing
her nose.
The field in which the negro was
lynched is the same spot the negro
gus was lynched on in November, 1887 Big-.

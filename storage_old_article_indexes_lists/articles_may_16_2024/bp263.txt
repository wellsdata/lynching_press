TRACES JUSTICE MOVES
Announcement of the order to the
grand jury was made by Clark in
an address before the New York
Herald Tribune Forum after trac-
ling recent moves bythe Justice De.
partment to fight mob. violence
The Attorney General said that de-
splte legal handicaps, there had
been 309 investigations involving
civil libertles since he entered the
President's cabinet 16 months ago.
Clark said the Federal Govern-
ment's jurisdiction in lynching cases
of
"depends upon a thin threat
law." He added that he was "sorry
to say there is no field of law in
which the Federal Government, is
expected to do so much with so lit-
tle. The Federal statutes give up
the power to prosecute only when a
person has been deprived of feder-
ally-secured rights. The right of
life. liberty and property, the Su-
preine Court of the United States
has repeatedly held, is not a Fed-
erally-secured right."
The Attorney General emphasized
what he called "the horror that re-
sults when mob violence takes over,
when lynch law replaces due pro-
cess and when irresponsible pe-
sons set themselves up as the judge,
the jury, the prosecutor and the
exccutioner."
WON'T BE BULLDOZED
Continued Clark: "There are
those who say I should devote more
time to acting and less to legalties
-unless there is an unwillingness
to act. Those who say that know
there is a genuine desire to act but
I shall not be bulldozed into acting
extra-legally. That" is the Fuscist
way-the Communistic way.
"The average colored citizen is a
good citizen and deserves better
treatment in the hands of a democ-
racy, Communism is not the answer
and Communistic leadership will
not cure it.

"The average colored citizen is

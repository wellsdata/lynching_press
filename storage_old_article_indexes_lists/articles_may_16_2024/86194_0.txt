Judge W. O. Forrist, at the memorial
services at the Liberty St. M.
E. Church, delivered an eulogy on
Garfield as follows:
FELLOW- CITIZENS .-- Touissant L'
Overture was a negro, born in St.
Domingo and a slave. He accomplished
his own freedom, -became
learned and a leader of bis race,
commanded the admiration of the
world and- died.
Lanfrey, one of the rarest thinking
ers and soundest historians of the
present age, speaking of him, his
achievements and his death, said:
" L'Overture could die for he had
done a great thing. He demonstrat-
kd that he and his race were men
and fully capable of self- government
."
Of him, whom the nation and the
world mourn, whose body, to- day,
amid tears and prayers, is being laid
to rest on the banks of Lake Erie, in
that beautiful cemetery, overlooking
its blue and peaceful waters, may it
not be said: Garfield could die for
he has done a great thing. He has
illustrated in himself, at once, the
possibilities of our free institutions
and the full measure and dignity of
the ideal American citizen.
It may not be, indeed it is not, a
great thing, -to be a clergyman,
-the President of of a College,
-a lawyer and stand in the
courts, -aGeneral and fight battles
, -to sit in the House of Repre-
sentatives, -to wear the Senatorial
mantle or to occupy the Presidential
chair, for all these things be but accidents
; but, to qualify one's self for
such high places, to make himself
equal to the faithful performance of
all their varied duties, and bear, well,
all the responsibilities peculiar and
incident to each; and in such manner
as to enoble and dignify all official
station, and at the sametime to meek-
ly sustain their aggregrated honors,
as but a citizen, is indeed a great
thing; and when such results have
been accomplished, the victor- such
a victor can afford to die.
All this and more the illustrious
dead has accomplished. With industry
, persistence and heroism he-
the obstacles that beset his path-
way from infacy to young manhood,
-put poverty, the absence of friends
and influence, as well as all adventitious
circumstances, out of the way
and behind, him; -toiled on and
ward until he found himself an accomplished
scholar, -a man of profound
learning in mathematics,
philosophy, -the classics, -states-
manship, modern languages, -the-
ology, -history, -inter- national and
constitutional law; and all this with-
out sacrifice or neglect of his social,
moral or religious nature. For all
these latter were as highly educated
and cultered as was his intellectual.
Indeed, in him were all the elements,
so united and harmoniously educated,
And
that he was every way a man.
this, after, all was his chief honor.
For, to be the true man is better than
the lawyer, -more to be sought than
the General, -higher than the Senator
and grander than President. The
tears of the nation, to- day, flow, for
Garfield- the MAN and
! power
His
his honors came from his knightly
manhood.
He lived in an age when" Young
America" was rampart, when old
age was not honored, and youth had
but little respect for its parentage;
yet all his life, the dead President,
everywhere, honored his parents.
It will be remembered, that even at
bis inauguration, in the presence of
the many thousands who witnessed
that ceremony, he paused and turned
away from all the glitter and pride
and glory of the hour, to reverently
kiss the venerable mother that bore
him, and to whom he that day gave the
seat of honor. Living and shining in
a society, where bold and unblushing
Atheism was fashionable, and its
chief advocate seemed to be the idol
of the hour, he was always an humble
, consistent, -militant Christian;
-for almost the entire term of his
married life he mainly resided in localities
, where lust, was not compelled
to seek its gratification in hidden
places or at midnight, and domestic
infidelity in high places, was often
found. Yet he was always the chivalric
and loyal husband. At Wash-
ington, where, for so many years, was
his official home; and where, in the
mad strife for place, preferment,
spoils, even, homes andchildren were
forgotten and sacrificed; yet always
to him was home an earthly heaven,
and his children were always upon
his mind and in his heart as if they
were the" Apple of his Eye," the
derly, carefully, lovingly did he tur-
ture and guard and cherish them.
In the highest sense, Garfield was a
great lawyer. He was cqual to the
mastery and application of any prin-
ciple of inter- national or constitution-
al law, and particularly where their
employment would vindicate the life
or liberty of the citizen, his power
before the courts was that of a giant.
Wherever or whenever he conceived
that human life or liberty was jeopar-
dized by a disregard of constitutional
safe- guards, even amid the thunder
of beligerent cannon, he would, and
did, hasten to
the last retreat of American liber
voluntarily, without
-against the opinions of his friends,
and even the practices of party associates
, and demand that that high
Tribunal should make these safeguards
efficient to both or
either, life or liberty, of even enemies
of the country.
Astonishing evidence of all this
will be found in the matter of Milli-
gan, application for the writ of ha-
beas corpus, one of the celebrated
cases argued by the deceased. Mil-
ligan and others, in 1863, and while
the war was flagrant, and the grand
issues involved, being in the balance,
had been arrested and convicted of
military military crimes crimes made made such such by by acts acts of of
Congress,
such
penalty denounced against
crimes, also, by acts of Congress, by a
military court in the State of Indiana.
The Federal courts, in that State,
at that time were open and had jurisdiction
of the offences, and of the
when arrested. If tried in
person the Federal courts, Milligan would
have enjoyed the right of trial by
jury; being tried by court martial he
was deprived of this great right.
Garfield held that under the circumstances
, the military court had
no jurisdiction, that in the State of
Indiana the laws were not silent,"
and their protection should be given
to every citizen. A writ of habeas
corpus was issued out of one of the
local courts, certified into the Federal
court at Washington, heard and
determined. On the hearing, Gar-
fleld made the leading and controll-
argument, -the court followed
his line of argument, -adopted his
conclusions and held the military
court without jurisdiction, and discharged
the the condemned men.
Nothing could illustrate the strength
of mind, the resources of the lawyer
or heroic character for and
the determination to sustain the constitution
which characterized the deceased
, better than this.
One of the most important or semi-
official positions he ever sustained,
and one altogether too nearly forgotten
, and by far too lightly considered
and esteemed, was that of educator.
For some considerable time he was
Professor of Latin, etc., at Hiram Institute
and afterward for nearly four
years its President. During his administration
, that Institute obtained
wonderful popularity. Located in a
rural village, away from railroads,
telegraphs, and remote from any considerable
city, with a curriculum
equal to any college, even the oldest
in the land; -its students would
eqaul, annually, the whole number
now in our own State University;-
while the methods and successes of
the instruction under that administration
were wonderful to the oldest
and best educators familiar with them.
Himself always abreast with the best
and most advanced thought of the
age, and having a clear perception
of the vast importance of education
to the nation, and an ardent love for
the young and an active sympathy
for the poor, he was a friend to common
schools; -all the machinery of edu-
cation. He demanded, that the edu-
tion of all the youth of the
should not only be sound and thor- land
ough, but should be free as the air
that God gave them. To educate
the young, according to constitutional
methods, at public expense, in his
judgment, was the clear duty of both
the State and Federal Government.
And to induce these Governments to
perform this high duty was a life long
toil and desire of his
The department of effation established
by the Federal Coslay
about the close of the war, -a department
the influence of which, for
good has no limit, was his child, and
fostered and supported by him. One
of the golden chains that bind Ohio
people to the dead, to- day, as strong
as any other, was forged by his ear-
nest, constant, cordial and intelligent
love for and interest in the common
schools; -free and thorough educa-
tion for all the people of both State
and nation.
As an orator the" Dead of Mentor
" was peerless in his age. That
this will be the recorded judgment of
American histo I can have no
doubt. His, was a commanding presence
, -his voice clear, resonant and
under perfect management; -always
self- possessed, his mind worked with
all the ease, -strength, -grace and
regularity of the most powerful yet
delicate machinery, his fancy was
grand, -lively and poetical, but
cantrolled by a refined taste and
sound judgment; while he possessed
almost infinite knowledge of human
nature and the nobler and better motives
which move and dictate human
conduct and action; as well a fund of
general knowledge, exceeded by
none, with a faultless memory, and
a recollection that never failed him,
and a command of classic English,
which he always used as the vehicles
for his thoughts, and which were as
clear always" as an idea;" with a
logic compact and inexorable as that
of mathematics; and over all and
above all, a heart bubbling up, full,
welling over with human love- love
for all. Such as he, indeed, could
not be less than a great orator, and
one, by his oratory, commanded al-
most and unlimited influedce.
As to his methods, as an advocate,
let his argument in the Milligan case
be taken for an example, -of his
Congressional efforts the world is as
familiar as I, and nothing further is
needed.
To appreciate his power as a popular
orator, one would desire to hear
him on the" stump," when some exciting
campaign was in progress, the
result of which, in his judgment, involved
some principle, as distin-
guished from accident; -where right
was at stake, or constitutional libr
of the government was chiefly concerned
. Or, in former years, before
official burdens fell so heavily upon
him, when, of a Sabbath, in some ancient
grove upon the Western Reserve
- his old, his only home, on some
one of those grand annual gatherings
of the church of which he was member
and Bishop, when he undertook
to explain, illustrate and enforce
some one of the grand truths of his
religion and" vindicate the ways of
God to men." On such occasions as
these, where tens of thousands of the
elite of would
him, he would show his full power,
and seem to be one of the" Gods."
Perhaps, on no one occasion, did
effort of his attract more atten-
any
tion from the scholar and true pathe
riot, than a short speech made at
Louisville, before
I think it was in the winter of 1859-
60 ;-( it may have been the winter
of 1860-61, the record is not now at
my command,) the legislatures of
Kentucky and Ohio, or at least the
members of these two bodies, met,
upon the invitation of those of Ken-
tucky, at Louisville, in the interest
of fraterual feeling and good neigh-
borhood between the States. It will
be remembered, that then, the
clou cloud portending civil war was in
the sky, and much bigger
than s' man's hand; the fevers
of sectional strife were burning
and lurid; Garfield then, as at his
death a Republican, as much opposed
to the interference with slavery in the
states, where it existed by constitutional
silence, if not, as he
was opposed, to its authority extension, over
Territory, then and theretofore free;
though but then twenty- eight years
of age, was a member of the Ohio
Senate, and the youngest member of
it, was chosen to formulate and voice,
the convictions of the great State he
honored, and he right royally did
this, as he did everything else he undertook
.
The great truths he then uttered;
fundamental principles of the constitution
he announced, and the real
relation of the one state to every
other in the union, -as well the glory
due to Kentucky; -and Ohio's fraternal
regard, so eloquently and exactly
put, that, eyen, the bitterest
" Fire Eater," was compelled to acknowledge
the righteousness of his
conclusions; and commend the purity
of his patriotism. H Garfield done
nothing else, that achievment might
have satisfied him.
Illustrating his wonderful self- possession
on the platform, and the full
power of his eloquence, to control
men, under any and all circumstances,
nothing of his recorded efforts,
nothing of the recorded efforts of the
living or dead, in any age, equals
the speech he made, at Wall Street
Exchange, in New York, on the
morning after Lincoln's assessination.
It will be remembered, that on the
night of the fourteenth of April, 1865,
there had been, a triple assassination,
in Washington; -Lincoln had been
shot and was dead- Young Webster
had been stabbed, and Seward, always
New York's favorite son, had
been mangled and cut, in his throat
and head, but had survived the
night, and was vibrating between life
and deafh, on the morning of the
15th.
In front and around the building
were fifty thousand people, mad-
wild with rage, at the death of Lin-
coln, and waiting only, to hear the
results as to Seward, whether for him
was life or death. It was a mob of infuriated
men, clamoring for vengeance,
against these unpardonable crimes.
On the veranda of the building, were
men- statesmen to whom the people,
in emergencies, had been accustomed
to look, Butler and Senator Dickin-
son, and others of their character.
Butler was speechless, except to say
" Gentlemen, he died in the fullness,
of his fame,"
Dickinson, was full of
denunciation, shouting" Burn up the
Rebel seed, root and branch." High-
er and higher, raged the storm. Some
one in the crowd said that Lincoln
should have been shot before; and
another that Seward had lived long
enough; -dead and dying, these men
in the gutter, -their blood mak-
ing red the street; just then, ten or
fifteen thousand of the mob, making
a cross
as
out of scannings, shouted,
it were a Shibboleth, the names
then famous newspaper office, and nd
were starting for it. This movement
meant death to its management-
flames to the to the building and destruction
to much of the city. Just
at this point, Garfield appeared upon
the veranda in front of the mob.
Young as he was- thirty- four years
of age; -his quick eye caught the
situation and saw the danger, and
well perceived that the storm must
be stayed at once, or never; and with
his clear eye, looking into the faces
of the wild- mad men before him,-
waved his hand, and spoke:
" Fellow- citizens: Clouds and darkness
are around about him! His pa-
villion is dark waters and thick clouds
of the skies! Justice and judgment
are the establishment of His face!
Mercy and truth shall go before His
throne! Fellow- citizens: God reigns
and the Government at Washington
still lives!"
The mob had changed to an order-
ly meeting, and its members retired
law- abiding citizens. The storm was
hushed, as was that on the sea, when
the Son of Man, commanded-" peace
be still."
It can well be seen from what has
already been said, that Garfield in
the highest and purest sense of the
word, was from early manhood to his
death, eminently a demagogue- a
Leader of the People. If other evidences
of this were needed, let me
note, his rapid and unparalelled successions
and achievements: -In 1837,
aged twenty- six years, the President
of one of the leading literary institutions
of his state; in 1859, member
of the State Senate; in 1861-3, General
, in command of an army, doing
brilliant and distinguished service in
camp and upon the field for his country
; -in 1863, a member of Congress,
and where he served continuously.
for eighteen year, until March 4th,
1880, -and then elected by his native
state to the United States Senate,
and which high office he held, when
elected President, and which he vacated
, only, as he was inducted, into
in of
the people; and the duties of the latter
office, he performed, until death,
gave him the christian's promotion!
There are many and obvious reasons
, why I shall attempt no estimate
, in detail, of his services in
either or all, of the high political or
military offices held by the dead, nor
of their immense value to the whole
country, both in the present, and in
the coming future- all these things, involve
living questions, as to which,
the record is not closed, -time and
experience, alone, will put limit and
boundary to their influence; and
are so
marked, the final judgment will be
the
and for this, all can well afford to
wait. So much as this can well be
said, everywhere, -in all positions,
pathe performed every duty of the hour
with signal and
sincere purity of purpose, having no
all
purpose,
the American people, -the advance-
ment of all public interest, a sacred
regard for the public honor, and an
undying charity for the whole country
and her institutions. Hence his
fame; for does not the poet sing:
- Honor and fame, from no condition rise:
Act well your past, there all the Honor lles,"
I have known the dead all his life.
To me, so knowing him, he would
have been the same grand man, bad
he never held official station. Every
position he ever occupied he has dignified
and made even more honorabie,
and eac'h as well as the people, is in-
debted to him; not he, to them!
Standing here, in this presence,
always to me royal one, -amid all
these emblems a of sympathy and sor
row, and looking from the Dead of
to- day, backward, oyer, well nigh, a
quarter of a century of his life, full
of ardent endeavor, for the achievements
of his high and noble ambitions
; -his complete and romantic
successes; his pure and lovable life,
full of all virtues and manly graces,
and all that he hath wrought for his
kind and his country, in the present,
and for the future, and grasping, in
the full measure of all, and the inheritance
he has left the land he
loved; indeed, it can be no wonder
that, out of the excess of the Nation's
grief, at his death, the wheels of a
Nation's transportation stand still,
and the flags, of its commerce, are
furled! -No wonder that the voices
of the money changers, are hushed
and the hum of traffic is silenced;
that" the plough stands still, in the
field of promise;" and, even, the
grinding at the mills, is low, and
fifty millions of people are weeping
because their beloved child" was, but
is not."
Fellow- citizens: Do we remember,
that upon no soil under the whole
heavens; that under the institutions
of no government on which the sun
shines; was or is a Garfield, with his
full and rounded manhood and triumphs
, a possibility, save alone,
American soil; -American institutions
! Should not the young remember
, that in this land under our fing,
their fortune- the fortune of overy
one, may parallel that of the dead
statesman, if he but wills it. The
duty of all, to our country is, so to
will, so to achieve! Here everyone is
and must be, the architect of his own
fortune, and that fortune should be
grand and glorious!
Garfield, was a self- made man! He
compassed the great ends to which
he attained, by the inherent force of
his own character, and mind, and
genius, -but all along, his life did
he travel and toil quite alone? Were
there no ministering spirits; no
guardian angels, close to him, to
cheer, -to comfort, -to inspire, -to
guide! The telegraph tells me, that
the hundreds of thousands, who will
attend the funeral of the Nation's
dead to- day at Cleveland, will see,
near his coffin, a ladder! -two posts,
supporting eight steps on rounds, one
above another, ornamented, aye,
covered, with rare and delicate flowers
, by the loving and gentle hands
of young ladies and dictated, by the
most exquisite taste; on the lower
round, is written, in flowers," canal,"
on the others above- Legislature
College- General Congress- Sen
ate- on the last" President," indi
eating, his progress upward, -step
by step, -from his humble beginning,
to the pround death
afound him! Truly, this is where a beautiful
and suggestive biography! A magnificent
floral eroglyphic! But did
not they, who made it," build wiser
than they knew?"
Are there not now, two historic
characters, -persons of singular purity
of character, -vigor of intellect,
excellence of tastes, -profundity of
judgment, and a wealth of love, who,
from his youth, have stood on either
side of the dead Caesar, strong in
their common love for, and faith in
him, to sustain him? Even as the
posts, in the allegory, support the
rounds, up which the Hero climbed,
so has not the mother and wife, sustained
, perhaps prompted, and aided
the Son and Husband, in every step
forward and upward, that he has
taken?
I would forget the
" Deep damnation
of his taking off"
if I could, but I cannot forget, the
beroic struggle, with the only enemy
he ever had the common enemy of
all- Death! -how the wife- Lucretia,
at the bed- side stood, watch and ward,
over the Husband, and when science,
in the estimate of its professors, had
exhausted its healing or saving pow
er. and they would abandon the de
fences, she sent them back to their
post of duty, there to stand, until
Death should fully raise its banner,
over all the fortifications of life,
and the aged mother, at Mentor, in
close communion, with the God of
her old age, in prayer, that her boy,
her Benjamin, -might be spared to
her! and how the persistence of each
and both, staid the hand of Death,
for many days.
May not the same devotion and
heroism of the wife, and importunities
of the mother, been the guardian
angels- the ministering spirits, upon
whose wings, as upon eagles, he
made his grand, -romantic ascension
in life? At least true it is, that their
love and sympathy have strewn his
pathway, with flowers, richer, 1
rarer, costlier, than ever bloomed
in garden, since Eden, or could grow
in Royal the
atmosphere, in which he lived, with
aroma, sweet as breath of angels!
Garfield's veneration for his mother,
and chivalric love and devotion to his,
now historical, wife, is a tribute to
them, richer than the Kingdoms of
the Earth, and of all the Jewels in
the Crown he shall wear, will be the
richest, -the clearest and most conspicuous
!
The President- the citizen- the
son- the husband- the father is dead!
" His sun set whilst it was yet
noon." Yet his life- his toil- his
virtues, his greatness, -he, himself,
and into
American history, into the history
of the world, and no page of
which, will be brighter, than that
occupied by him and his!
In view of all we have seen and
heard since the President's death
of his and moral
the love of the American people for
him, and the universal at his
loss- may I not say, as they lay the
" tired" President to his eternal rest,
using his own words over the body
of the dead Lincoln, who loved him:
" His death has brought the American
people so near to Heaven, that they
can hear the whisperings of God
the children of men." to

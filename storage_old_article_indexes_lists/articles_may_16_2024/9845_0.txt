It is said that the mob which hung Tom
Blair at Mt. Sterling consisted of fifteen
persons, and the Governor has offered
8400 each for their apprehension and
arrest, and to this the county has added
$ 100 each. This reward has brought
three detectives on the ground, and in
less than a week every one in the mob
will likely be arrested, and the Grand
Jury, which meets next Monday, will
have no trouble indicting..

two sisters, Mrs. Charles S. Ward and
Mrs. Thomas W. Ewing. The reception
was one of the most enjoyable of the season
. After the reception the entire party
repaired to the Younf Men's Christian association
rooms and witnessed the basketball
game between the two teams.
The city court grand jury went in a
body today and inspected
the county
farm, convict camps and several other
places with a view of reporting their condition
to Judge Alto V. Lee. It is thought
the grand jury will finish its labors by
the middle of next week.
An additional clerk has been allowed
the local postoffice. The force of clerks
has been practically doubled within the
past two years. The titles for the site
of the new postoffice building have been
approved and it is expected that the contract
for its construction will be let during
the early spring.
GOVERNOR AFTER LYNCHERS.
Wants to Indict Parties Who Swung
Up Negroes In Monroe, La.
Baton Rouge, March 16.- The lynching
of two negroes early Friday morning
at Monroe, caused Gov. Blanchard
to call upon District Judge Madison of
Monroe today to make a special investigation
, and if possible indict the leaders
of the party which did the hanging
. In a letter to the sheriff of Mon-
roe the governor said:
" Lynchings do not prevent crime.
One wholesome hanging by law is more
effective than several lynchings. We
can not hope to have capital and immigration
continue to come to our
with such acts of lawlessness
every state now and then."

RACE WAR IN INDIANA.
Drunken Negroes Start a Reign of Terror
at Cement ville -- One of the Rioters Shot.
Whites Keeping Within Doors.
Jeffersonville, Ind., Dec. 26.- A race
war is on at Cementville, five miles
north of this city, and serious trouble
is expected at any minute The
. ne
all armed and the whites
groes are
,
are keeping within doors to avoid
them.
The outbreak began yesterday when
Lee Ranger and John Redmond, ne-
groes, both very drunk, started in to
intimidate whites. When their insults
were resented other negroes
jumped in with the liquor- crazed men
and captured Sam Kendall's saloon.
Nearly 20 shots were fired, but no one
was hurt. Kendall, in addition to his
saloon conducts a dry goods store
,,
which was being attended by his
wife, and into this the negroes flocked
after the firing at the saloon.
Mrs. Kendall was badly frightened
and her husband ran into the place
and began shooting into the mob.
Ranger was shot, but how badly is
not known, as he was carried away
and secreted by his companions. Ken-
dall's life was threatened and about
midnight he was able to escape from
his store and came direct to this city
,
awakening Prosecutor Montgomery
and begging him to issue warrants
and have deputy sheriffs sworn in to
serve them. It was almost daylight
when the town became quiet, the ne-
groes having everything their own
way. No further outbreak has taken
place, because the whites are intimidated
to such an extent that they are
every possible precaution to pre-
using vent a collision with the blacks. It is
believed the slightest
quarrel
bring about a bloody riot. will

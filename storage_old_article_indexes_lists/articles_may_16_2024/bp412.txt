A Tipton county grand jury was
held Wednesday and recessed until
September 1, without making a re-
port, after it had heard the witnesses.
Gooden was taken from the custody
of Sheriff W. J. Vaughn by six mask-
ed men as he was being returned from
a Memphis jail.
The sheriff offered to testify at the
hearing but was not called. A dep-|
uty sheriff, who was stationed at the
city jail when an earlier attempt to
get Gooden was made, also did not
testify.
Circuit Judge R. B. Baptist, who
called the grand jury, told the mem-
bers that the lynching was "one of
the most horrible and disgraceful
crimes of Tipton County." He coun-
seled that everyone connected with
the mob was guilty of murder in che
first degree and said that he would
excuse any juryman who felt he could
not make an open minded investiga-
tion.

ward in connection with the recent

Covington. He said "Tennessee thor-
oughly despises and condemns this
form of lawlessness."

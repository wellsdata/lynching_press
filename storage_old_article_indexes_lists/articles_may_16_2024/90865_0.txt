Hangman's Day.
Conway, S. C., seems to have been the
only point where last hangman's day was
duly observed. Two colored men named
William Hardee and Solomon Hewett
were privately executed in the county jail.
Last October they murdered Jeremiah
Stalvey, a country storekeeper, for$ 15. A
month ago they made their escape from
jail after killing a prisoner who would not
join them. The fugitives were followed
by bands of armed men and bloodhounds,
ten days later were captured. They
and then narrowly escaped lynching.

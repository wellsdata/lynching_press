AT NAACP RALLY
Congressman to Tell
Story of Lynch TrialNAACP
Hon. Charles Diggs, the first Negro representative in
Congress from the State of Michigan, will come to Cleveland
Sunday to tell what happened in the Mississippi trials of two
white men for the lynching of a 14-year-old Negro boy.
The congressman was present at
every minute of the four-day trial,
and will relate his experiences as
featured speaker at the closing of
the 1955 NAACP membership
drive. He will speak at Shiloh Bap-
tist church. The meeting starts at
3:30 p.m.
Rep. Diggs was forced to sit at
the jim-crow Negro press table at
the trial. With the colored newspa-
and
permen
women he
was
the
subjected to daily insults by
sheriff's deputies, court aides and
the white audience.
Witnessed Cover-Up
He saw the failure of the pros-
ecutor to make a really sound
case against J. W. Milan and Roy
Bryant, who beat and shot to death
young
Emmett Louis Till, then
dumped his body into the Tallah-
atchie River.
The two men are still facing
kidnap charges in another county
after being acquitted of the charge
of murder.
The talk of the congressman will
culminate the most intensive drive
for new members that the Cleve-
land Branch has ever conducted.
At mid-point the branch reported
that it had over 3,000 members
and more than $14,000 in cash con-
tributions, highest mid-way point
in the branch's history.

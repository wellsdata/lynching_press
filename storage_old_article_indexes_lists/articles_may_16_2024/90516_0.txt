NEGRO MINSTREL LYNCHED.
Row in Which Whites Were Shot
from the Stage.
A crowd of masked men overpowered
the jailer at New Madrid, Mo., and took
Louis Wright, a negro, a short distance
from town and hanged him. Richard and
Pringle's negro minstrels gave an entertainment
the other night and an alterea
tion arose between of musicians
and some of the white town boys. Several
of the boys undertook to take the
musicians out, and the negroes on the
stage began to shoot. Several whites
in the audience were struck, but no one
was seriously hurt. The negroes ran out
the back way to their private car. The
car was surrounded by armed men, but
no violence was done owing to the arrival
of the town Arshal. All the ne
groes were put in jail and the name of
the one who did the shooting was discovered
. He was lynched and the others
will be released. Several of prisoners
were badly beaten. the

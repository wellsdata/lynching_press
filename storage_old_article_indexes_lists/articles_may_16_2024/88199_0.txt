New Orleans, Oct. 25- Tom Compton,
a negro, lynched Centerville,
Miss yesterday. It is alleged that he
confessed to the murder of Ely Whit√°-
ker, a farmer.
Whitaker was murdered Tuesday and
all that night a posse of men, suspecting
foul play, searched for him. With
this posse was the negro Compton. Yesterday
he begged leave of the searchers
to go home, but after he had gone the
posse followed him finding, it is alleged,
that instead of going home he had gone
to the spot where the body of Whitaker
lay, and cutting off the head, arms and
legs with an axe, dropped them into
sinkhole near his cabin. a

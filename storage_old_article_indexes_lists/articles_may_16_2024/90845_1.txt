ITALIAN PAPERS BITTER.
Denounce the Walsenburg Lynchings
as Remnants of Barbariem.
The New York Herald's special cable
from Rome says:" The newspapers here
are very bitter against the United States
in consequence of the lynching of the
Italians at Walsenburg. They denounce
the murders as a remnant of barbarism
and demand that energetic measures shall
be taken in the affair. It is stated, however
, that the Italian Government has
been until now satisfied with the attitude
of the Federal Government and the action
of the Italian ambassador at Wash-
ington. There is a desire to avoid a repetition
of the New Orleans incident in
1891, when Fava was recalled by
the Marquis Baron di Rudini."

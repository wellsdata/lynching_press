headed by Genken, started on his trail,
determined to lynch him if they

doubt as now to the removal of Holley from
the jail.

was circulated the whites so
that the colored people would disperse
and give the whites a free field for a
lynching. A great mob of colored people
Sunday night surrounded the jail.
The colored people have sent couriers
to Langston City, the colored colony,
ten miles distant, with the report that
the whites are about to lynch an
cent colored man, and many colored inno

shot to death.
This news has greatly intensified the
excitement and the colored people are
threatening violence. The officers have
been aware of the lynching for some
hours and began disarming the colored
men before it became generally known,
anticipating that the news would
the colored people into a frenzy. drive

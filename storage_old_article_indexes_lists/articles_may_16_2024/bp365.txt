An Example To
The South
From Richmond Times-Dispatch Richmond Times- Dispatch
LL praise to the North Carolina au-
thorities, in general, and to the Per-
-
son County Grand Jury in particular,
for the indictment of 10 members of a
mob which attempted to lynch a Negro
there last Auugst.
4th
This is the sort of expeditious action
against would-be lynchers which puts a
curb on them, as well as on other po-
tential. Southern mobsters. The best way
to stop the lynchings which still disgrace
the South, albeit at much rarer intervals
than formerly. is for State and local au-
thorities to bestir themselves with the
determination and dispatch which have
characterized North Carolina's handling
of the attempted mob murder in Person
County.
Judge Henry A. Grady, who presides
over the court there, has asked Governor
Broughton to call a special term of that
tribunal for the trials. Judge Grady be-
longed to the Ku-Klux Klan a long time
ago, but he seems not to wear the stigmata
of his erstwhile affiliation today.
North Carolina has made an excellent
start toward a proper disposition of the
mobsters who tried recently to disgrace
that State. All that remains now is for
those who are guilty to be convicted and
to receive the sentences they deserve.

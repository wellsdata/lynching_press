Judge Miller also spoke of the spirit of
mob action." Lynch law," he said," is
written in the hearts of depraved manhood
, of cowardly manhood. When men
talk of lynching and of killing a man.
they have depraved hearts. They are
cowards. Enforce the law, forget property
, and put our thought on the
preservation let's of human life in Alabama."

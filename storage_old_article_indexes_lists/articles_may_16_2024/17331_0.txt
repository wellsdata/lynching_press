fee, and then vocifurale hoarsely for law and
order. At this distance, and in the lamentablo
ignorance which mis eads them, we do not
wonder at their errors; but we confidently venture
the assertion that if the very same men,
were tney on the ground. would be found active
members of the Committee of Vigilance.
This another important feature in which
this matter is pertinaciously misunderstood by
so accustomed to 10 regard an exercise of Lynch
law as the excited act of a mob, that they can
not understand how a whole pe ple should be
imbued with a desire to raise superior to the
laws. Yet such was the case; and in that very
fact is found the most irrefragible proof of
their course. All
the necessity and propriety of
men know; that when a whole people are exci-
and alarmed, and resort to extraordinary
and revolutionary measures to rid themselves
of dangerous enemies, there must be more truth,
more justice and more patriotism in their con-
duet. than superficial and wishy- washy retailers
morality are capable of apprehending or
appreciating of.

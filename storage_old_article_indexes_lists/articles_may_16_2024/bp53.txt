PIONEER IN BERWYN FIGHT
MAKES SCIENTIFIC STUDY
OF THE SEGREGATION ISSUE

Dr. Leslie Pinkney Hill's recent pro-segregation speech has been the occasion of
ch bitter criticism and condemnation. Many individuals of the race joined some of
newspapers, namely, the Philadelphia Independent and other papers, in scathing de-
asiation of Dr. Hill's advocacy of a form of racial circumscriptions and separation which

to obtain and safeguard the edu-

the equal educational laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
That only a negligible few of the
more than 200,000 Negroes of our
city have supported us in their
fight, can well be attested to by our
members.
The citation of the existence of
the Educational Equality League
and its lack of racial support is
made only to ask one question:
Why have many of us failed to sup-
port this and similar organizations
that are fighting for our legal
rights, and against illegal discrim
ination against and segregation of
us? It certainly is not because the
majority of us believe in segrega-
tion, but simply because we reason
that inasmuch as the institution of
segregation has become so firmly
intrenched among us that it is vain
and impossible for us to abolish it,
in spite of laws to the contrary,
and still others who are opposed to
the institution, do not exert them-
selves in opposition thereto for the
reason that they fear that it will
endanger their already insecure
economic security or jobs to be
more explicit. But both these rea-
sons are unsound, for in the first
instance
any rublio institution
'which is contrary to established
law is illegal and therefore subject
to and possible of abolition; and in
the second instance very few Ne-
groes have lost their jobs for con-
tending for their civil and public
rights, which were bestowed on
them by none other than the so-
called dominant group.
In deciding
the
question of
whether Negroes should accept or
reject segregation, the arguments
advanced should be based upon
state law and on the merits or de-
merits of the case. For instance,
in Pennsylvania the legislative act
establishing a public school sys-
tem did not establish a separate
system for the Negro and white
races. And it specifically prohibits
in section 1405 of the School Code
any distinction on account of race
or color. Therefore, in Pennsylva-
nia there is but one way of decid-
ing the school segregation issue and
that is on the basis of existing
laws. All other grounds for d√©cid-
ing the issue in this state must be
relegated to the future, until, at
such time the Negroes decide to
agitate for the repeal of present
equal educational laws. So the
question of segregated schools in
Pennsylvania is already decided
by law.
Now it is well to examine at least
some of the supposed merits of
segregation in our schools. Pro-
segregationists argue that the col-
ored children fare better under Ne
gro teachers. That this is true by
reason of the fact that the raco
teachers better understand the Ne-
gro child and his needs. Although
the first argument that the Negro
children fare better under their
own teachers is true to a certain
extent, it is also true that the Ne-
gro school by virtue of its inade-
quate provision and consequent in-
equality, especially as they exist in
the South and must inevitably ex-
ist everywhere else where the sy9-
tem of segregation is complete,
cannot do otherwise than turn out
an Inferiorly educated child. A
very concrete example of this was
a Negro child of my acquaintance
who graduated from a so-called ac-
credited southern high school. He
applied for admission to Temple
University, but was rejected on the
ground that Temple could only
recognize two years of his four
years high school course. The con-
sequence was that he had to go
back to high school for two more
years! Imagine six years of high
school, which was all the result of
a segregated system of education,
with in many respects under-
trained and underpaid teachers.
Again it sometimes happens in
the segregated school that the sys-
tem of school supervision is not ac-
cording to the rules as rigidly en-
forced as it is in the white school.
There is resultantly much class
room laxity, such as passing a
child from one grade to another,
regardless of merit; and also, in
many instances favoritism has too
often found its way into the class
rooms of the separate school, re-
sulting in the unmerited advance-
ment of many of the children of
the favored few. So it is clear
that regardless of this better un-
derstanding on the part of the Ne-
gro teacher of the Negro child and
his needs, that such does not and
cannot in many cases result in a
race child faring better. Perhaps
such would be the case if the Ne-
gro teacher taught in the same
school with his white associate.
Then he would undoubtedly be able
to communicate some of his un
derstanding of the Negro child to
his colleagues of the opposite
group.

schools.
Another convincing example of.
the handicap of the segregated
school to the Negro student which
comes from the birthplace of seg-
regation, the south, is one of a Ne-
gro girl who graduated from a
group 1, class A, state of North
Carolina, approved high school.
She graduated in the upper three-
quarters of her class, which would
have entitled ber to admission
without an entrance examination
as was the policy in the
of white students from
the same standing of high
At least this is what Dr. J. Henry
Highsmith of the department of
public instruction of the state of
North Carolina wrote to me. Hence,
segregated schools, even those that
have a competent faculty of teach-
ers, but who are more or less re-
stricted, cannot be anything else in
the end but a handicap to the Ne
gro students.
With respect to the economic ar
gument for segregated schools that
it affords employment to a number
of Negro teachers, this too must
be conceded.
But on
hand, especially in states like Penn-
sylvania with equal educational
laws, the Negro teacher has the
legal opportunity of teaching in
any school. However, they are not
to be blamed for taking advantage
of this one opportunity of teaching
in any school. However, they are
not to be blamed for taking advan-
tage of this one opportunity of
teaching in any school. However,
they are not to be blamed for tak-
ing advantage of this one oppor
tunity of practicing their profes-
sion even in a segregated school,
when the Negro masses are doing
nothing to bring about enforce-
ment of the law which gives them
equal teaching privileges and the
opportunity to teach in any school.

I do not
In making this statement
mean that Negro teachers and prin-
cipals are justified in upholding the
system of school segregation and
justifying ita existence by baseless
reasons. They should quietly and
efficiently pursue their teaching
without at any time attempting to
hinder any fight that the com-
munity may make in behalf of
equal teaching opportunities for
them. In the state where segrega-
tion has been established by state
law, as for instance in the south,
if the Negrocs in those states de-
sire mixed schools, then it should
be by means of agitation for repeal
of the state law which has estab-
lished the segregated institution.
come
Still another reason of the advo-
cates of separate schools is that
while teachers are naturally preju
diced against Negroes and that
they naturally as a result must be
blased and unfair in their judgment
of the scholastic ratings of the Ne-
gro child. However, this may "d
true, there is ample proof in th
numerous graduations of our gir s
and boys from mixed schools th .t
such is not generally the case. And
if competent and efficient colored
teachers were teaching in the me
actools such a policy would
even more neglible than it is today.
It is manifest that any institu-
tion which has so evidently im-
proved the relations between the
white ard Negro races as the
mixed school system, should be re-
tained by all means regardless of
its resultant betterment of inter-
racial understanding ought to out-
weigh all other considerations
whose effect is merely racial, espe-
cially in a country where it is im-
possibie for the Negro to isolate
himself trom the whole American
peopie. And even then, if he could
so isol: te himself, he would soon
become poverty stricken, as the
races of mankind are so depend-
ent one on the other, that not one
of them can prosper and in most
cases survive without living and
working together. In the pioneer-
ing stage of the world such might
have been possible, but not in this
modern interrelated and interde-
pendent world.
Certainly it seems to me that the
Negroes of America who have suf-
fered so much as a result of seg-
regation, should be most thorough-
ly convinced that it is not the best
thing for them, and therefore that
they should be most violently op
posed to it. Where is that person
among us, especially among those
of us who have lived in the south
where the results of racial separa.
tion are everywhere evident and
felt, who deep down in his heart
does not feel that it is America's
most damnable and inhuman insti-
tution?

There the
whites are falsely taught the doo
trine of the inferiority of the Ne
gro, and the absolute need of sep-
arating him as such from the rest
of humanity if they would avoid
being contaminated by him.' The
whites have as a result of such
miseducation concerning the Negro
become mentally obsessed with re-
sultant prejudices. Consequently,
they give expression to these prej
udices against the Negro in varl-
ous and numerous ways. For in-
stance, in the south we and such
prejudices manifested in the forma
of universal segregation of the Ne-
gro by law; separate and ill pro-
vided for schools, unequal public
accommodations, in spite of segre-
gation, disfranchisement, unconsti-
tutional lynching of the Negro, gen-
eral injustices in the courts, and
section wide contempt, hatred; and
prejudices against him. In the
north where the trend toward seg-
regation is increasing, this monster
of race prejudice which has result-
ed mainly from segregation, has
raised its head in numerous places.
Among such places are the public
schools, many of our courts, in a
number of places of public accom-
modations, and in, Berwyn or the
townships of Easttown and Tredyf-
frin, where 250 Negro children have
been kept out of school for more
than a year, simply because their
parents have refused to send them
to an illegally established school.
And these are only some of the
places where the monster of race
prejudice and segregation has
raised its ugly head.
On October 18th, in the year of
our Lord 1933, there was enacted
on the Eastern Shore of the state
of Maryland, one of the most grue-
some and horrible lynchings that
has ever disgraced the already
stained banners of America. It
was an uncivilized and atrocious
act that can well be traced to the
miseducation of a people concern-
ing the truth about the Negro and
their consequent intense hatred of
and prejudice against him. This
terrible atrocity gives Negroes even
more reason for girding themselves
for a never ending war against the
institution of race segregation,
which has caused us so much un-
told suffering and which is cer-
tainly a disgrace to our flag and
country, the United States of
America.

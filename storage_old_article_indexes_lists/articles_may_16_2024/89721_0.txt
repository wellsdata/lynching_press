LAST NIGHT BY A MEXICAN
EMIL LINDTHEL FATALLY STABBED
A few minutes after 11 o'clock last
night Emil Linthel yesterday stabbed
in the rear of H. Kreismer's barber
shop on Brewery avenue. The deed
was committed by a Mexican who is
now in jail.
The first warning that a tragedy had
been committed was a loud outery by
Linthel that he had been stabbed. He
yelled for those near to catch a Mexi-
can claiming that he had done the
deed.
Several bystanders rushed from in
front of the Brewery saloon, and Jack
Wikstrom caught the Mexican pointed
out by the wounded man. Friends
rushed to Linthel's assistance, and he
was taken inside the saloon.
The Mexican was taken before him
and Lindthel stated positively that he
was the man who had made the fatal
thrust. Several other Mexicans were
searched, but allowed to go. Officer
Overlock placed the Mexican under arrest
and he was taken at once to the
city jail.
The wounded man was taken to a
booth in the rear of the saloon and
laid on the floor. He was able to talk,
but as soon as his clothes were torn
from his breast it was seen that a
knife thrust had been made on the
left side just below the collar bone.
In a few moments his breast and
clothes were saturated with blood, and
the gradually grew weaker. Lindthel
made a request to be turned on his,
side, and when this was done blood
began to flow from his mouth.
In a few moments the man was
dead. Dr. Edmondson came as soon as
he be summoned, but arrived
too could late to be of any service. He stated
that the knife had severed one of the
arteries leading to the heart, and that
death was caused by inward bleeding.
As soon as Linthel was dead Justice
Williams arrived and summoned the
following jury to serve at the inquest:
John
W. J. Nemick, W. P. Jones,
Brannon, A. T. Weaver, Wm. Beck,
and Wm. Horn. They viewed the remains
, and will meet this morning to
arrive at a verdict.
Then began a search for the knife
with which the crime had been committed
. A drop of blood was found on
a board near the steps leading up to
the porch of the Dubacher building at
the north end.
The blood lead to the Brewery saloon
. The alley and boxes, or any
place in which a knife might be secreted
, were carefully searched. After
half an hour's careful scrutiny of the
surroundings. Office. Howe found the
knife just under the corral fence east
of E. G. Ord's plumbing house.
It was an ordinary butcher knife
that had been carefully worked down
to a thin sharp blade, and was covered
from point to hilt with blood. It was
found about ten yards from where the
tragedy occurred.
Shortly the Mexican arrested
was taken after to jail an officer went to
his cell ande xamined his hands. He
one of them covered with blood
that was hardly yet dry.
About this time threats were made
of lynching, and had any one volunteered
to act as a leader, the crowd
would have gone to the jail, taken
out the Mexican and strung him up to
nearest pole. For an hour lynch
the talk was kept up, but about 1 o'clock
this morning it had subsided.
At one time there was a large
gathered around a Mexican throught crowd
to have been with the alleged murderer
. He was carefully searched for
weapons, and some wanted to take
him out and lynch him for being in
all probability an accomplice.
Numerous theories are advanced as
to what might have caused the stabbing
. One is that Lindthel refused
the Mexican a glass of beer, and that
the latter swore revenge, which he
took in a bloody manner.
Both of the principal actors in the
tragedy came up yesterday from Cana-
nea, where the dead man spent a few
days working in a barber shop. They
may have had trouble there, though no
one here last night was able to throw
any light on the affair.
Lindthel came to this city about the
months ago from Bakersfield, Calif.,
and was employed in the barber shop
owned
on Brewery avenue, by H.
Kreimer. He quit a short time ago
Lindthel came to this city about three
city yesterday.
This morning the dead man was to
go to Tucson, where he had a position
in one of the barber shops there waiting
for him. He was around town before
the stabbing, and was seen in
several of the saloons, though did not
drink heavily.
The deceased is about thirty- years of
age, and was considered a good workman
at his trade. He weighed about
170 pounds, was light complexioned,
and wore a mustache. He was of German
descent.
At a late hour this morning the talk
lynching was revived, but subsided
of shortly afterward.

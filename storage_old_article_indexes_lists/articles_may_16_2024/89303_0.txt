FOUR WERE LYNCHED.
Aberdeen, Miss., Sept. 14.- Details
of the lynching of four negroes
near the town of Quincy, 15 miles
distant from Aberdeen, reached
here to- day. Two weeks
ago Thomas Woodruff and his five
children were taken violently ill
and two of the children died in
great agony. Woodruff and the
other children are dying. Some
of the neighbors became very ill,
about the same time an examination
, was made of the well on
Woodruff's place. This brought
to light three packages of" rough
on rats." Ben Jackson, a negro,
was arrested on suspicion, but was
taken from the Sheriff by mob
and hanged. Jackson's wife, Ma-
haley Jackson, and his mother- in-
law, Lou Carter, were examined
by the Coroner's jury the next day
and both testified that Rufus Broy-
les, a negro of the neighborhood,
had given Jackson the money with
which the poison was bought.
The two women were discharged,
but were taken in hand by the
mob and hanged, and Broyles,
who had been in hiding, was captured
yesterday at Wood's Mill, a
few miles from Quincy, and
last night bung

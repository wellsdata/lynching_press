THE Springfield company of militia
was sent to Urbana, O., on the 4th by
the governor to protect the negro who
had been sentenced to 20 years' impris-
onment the day before for criminal assault
, but they seemed to excite the
mob so much that they were ordered
to return to the depot. Immediately
after the jail was broken into and the
brute was soon in the hands of
negro the mob and hanging from a tree.

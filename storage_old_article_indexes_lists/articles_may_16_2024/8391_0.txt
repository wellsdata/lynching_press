LYNCH LAW.- Jack Edmondson, a suspected
horse- thief, was hung near his
own house, in the western part of Jackson
township, Mo. There were about sixt,
persons engaged in the affair. They
tied a gag in his mouth, to prevent him
calling for help, and tied his hands securely
behind him. The limb to which
he was hanged was more elastic than was
supposed, for it appears that when suspended
his feet touched the ground. Intent
on hanging him, they tied another
rope to his feet and fastened that to
another tree, thus hanging him by both
feet and neck. They left a card pinned
to his, upon which was written
The doom clothes of a horse- thief."

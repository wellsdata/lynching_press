Newspapers and other periodicals
throughout the civilized world are
carrying descriptive accounts of
what transpired a few days ago
at Shelbyville. Tennessee, when a
mol of more than a thousand Ten-
nesseaus benr on lynching a Negro
who was then being tried, charged
by six
hundred
with an assault upon a white girl,
were repuiset
guardsmen representing the state
and federal polige power. The de-
feated mob finally applied zaso-
line to the $150,000 court house
and set it on fire. In addition to
the destruction of this $150,000
building, there were four of the
national murdsmen's trucks over
turned and burned.
Three of the members of the
moh have already paid with their
lives for their interference with
the the process of Law and "the

As gruesome and as uncivilized
as the behavior of this mob ap-
pears. I somehow feel that they
are much more consistent than the
rest of us. In all probability, there
will be nobody convicted for burn-
ing the court house or the national
guardsmen's tricks because of the
circumstances under which these
crimes were committed. However.
it under any other circumstances,
the court house of any town or the
trucks of the national guardsmen
should be over turned and set on
ure, the person responsible would
surely be convicted. But since they
were burned in an attempt to get
a Nero whom they planned to
Lynch or because they were ont-
witted in their attempt to get this
Nero: and even the there are pho-
tographs of the persons pouring
the casoline and applying the
match, there will probably be notů-
ing done about it.
This Negro was being tried in a
community where he might have
been a tax payer, but could not
serve on the police force or in the
fire department: no other mem-
ber of his group could serve as a
member of the jury, There is per-

but I suspect there are no accom-
modations for Negrocs.
Newspapers and various orga-
nizations all over the country,
which have been silent on these
other questions, will come out now
and condemn the mob.
A few days ago in the City of
Atlanta, a Judge of the Polic
Court fined a colored woman for
signing her name "Mrs." on a sales
contract This matter was brought
to the attention of a group of Ne-
gro and white citizens by the pas-
tor of the church to which this
woman belongs. This group of peo-
ple found themselves helpless to
do anything about it.
The Attorney General called a
National Conference on Major
Crimes of America and left lynch-
ing off the agenda. Because a fev

Just a NegrO
We seem to under estimate th
intelligence of the mob when w
think that they are going to pa:
any attention at all to newspape
editorials or good intentioned re
solutions. The ad thing about thi
situation as far as the Nezro is
concernel is in the language of
Job: "His days are few and they
are full of trouble.". He must non
not only be tried for the origtua
indictment, but he must also
tried now for the burning of thi
court house: for the death of th
members of the mob who have dier
and who may yet die, as well a
those wounded: he must also pr
for permitting the sheriff and the
other white people to take him to
Nusbrille. Believe it or not, the
mob seems consistent. It says i
the Mayor of our city and othe
public officials: the superintend
ents of education; the pasters o
our churches; as well as the head-
of our business concerus, if Ne-
groes are not permitted to voje,
to hold publie oftler, must revive
different salaries from other p**-
ple only because they are colorsi,
must be given inferior accomla-
tions at every point they
touch
the institutions or agencies that
serve the public in general. Then
why should you demand that
moh treat them as if they were
equal to other people.
In other words, the mois, is con-
fused, I imagine, as to where is
the saturation that marks the end
of where one shall be considered
not quite a citizen: and almost a
settizen. "Which form of lynching"
asks the mob, "shall be employed
and who shall determine the me
thodology?" The Judze imposes
one type of lynching: the minister
another: the governor another:
the head of the Dartment of
Education another. The, meubers
of the most feel that they should
not be discriminated against. They
don't interfere with these other de
partmental heads in their method
of lynching Negros, 123el they
don't see why they should be in
terfered with. The sheriff of Shel-
hyville would not have Negro por
liemen and I can understand how
the mole felt toward his interfer-
ing with their normal promlure.”
Consistent in Destruction
Whatever may be said to the
contrary, the mob seems to me to
be the most consistent crow u
mongst us. I fancy that the mem-
bers of the mob feel that the rest
of society is in cordial sympathy
with them, and these more or less
sporadie outbursts of condemna-
tion that follow a spectacular lynch
ing are regarded as a part of the
general scheme. I don't think the
mob takes either the newspapers
-anti-lynching committees or any
y else very porlatusly. Their
position in this respect seems_per-
fectly logical and sound. “And yet
I say unto you that "Lynching
will never stop as long as Negroe
are denied the right and privilege
of other American citizens," which
denial is basual fundamentally up-
un ractal identity.
The mob was also consistent in
attempting to destriy anything
that came between them and their
victim. They might have done what
us sometinie do: turn on

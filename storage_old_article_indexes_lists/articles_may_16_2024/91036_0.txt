Governor Buchtel Releases On of the Convicts, Who, In An Effort to
" On this, Labor Day, Governor
Buchtel has granted you an unconditional
pardon. You are free to go
where you please. I congratulate you
on your pardon."
So spoke Warden John Cleghorn to
Frank, alias" Kid" Wallace, No. 5081,
in the chapel of the Colorado peniten-
tiary Monday a. m. at 10 o'clock, as he
held in his hand the official pardon
which Governor Buchtel had sent by
mail.
Three mighty cheers went up from
the 600 convicts, men and women, who
had gathered for the glad occasion.
Every Labor Day a convict is pardon-
ed Who the lucky man is no one
.
knows until the pardon is announced.
A number of convicts had brought
pressure to bear in order to secure
their release. Among these were Wal-
lace. His crime is well known to Canon
City people. He is one of the four
prisoners who escaped over the back
wall in the spring of 1900. One of them
to
stabbed Night Captain Rooney
death. Who did the stabbing was never
clearly set forth. A prisoner named
Wagner got away. The others say it
drove into
he who the knife
was
Rooney's body. The other three were
captured. One man was lynched by
frenzied Canon City people who gathered
in a mob. They hanged him to a
telegraph pole near the penitentiary.
The other two men were given long
term sentences. One of them was Wal-
lace. The other, Antone Wood, was
pardoned several years ago.
Because of the intense feeling that
prevailed hereabouts at the time, Wal-
lace's attorney secured a change of
venue, and he was tried in Chaffee
county. He was sentenced to 25 to 45
years for murder.
Wallace has, since that time, been a
model prisoner. He was a young man
when he first went into the prison, a
mere boy in years, convicted of robbery
. He was still a mere boy when
he went into the plot to gain his free-
dom. Now he is only 28 years old. But
the confinement has told upon his once
strong body. He is almost entirely
deaf. Warden Cleghorn was compelled
to shout the words of pardon into his
wear. Wallace was a happy man today.
He left the prison and Cason City De
train No. 4 on the D.& R. G. this afternoon
. He was dressed in a suit of
clothes Warden Cleghorn provided for
him. He was on his way to Alliance,
Neb., where he has a brother who is
willing to care for him. He expects a
good home and happiness there.
a
Governor Buchtel's pardon was
document of some length. It set forth
the right of the chief executive to pardon
a prisoner on Labor Day and then
designated Frank Wallace, who was
sentenced Jan. 26, 1901, for murder.
A number of reasons for the pardon
were cited, and the governor stated
that he had carefully gone over the
case before he arrived at a decision.
Rev. W. S. Rudolph, former pastor
of the prison, testified that Wallace
had experienced a change of life; that
he had been amply punished for his
crime and that he would, lead a
straight life in the future. All the
jurors in the case who could be located
expressed it as their opinion
that Wallace should be given the benefit
of some doubt, and recommended
the pardon. The trial judge, Hop M
S. Bailey, of Canon ity stated,
that it was doubtful then and is more
doubtful now whether or not Wallace
is guilty of murder. He says further
that Wallace was in no sense a leader
in the attempted escape.' He is broken
in spirit and in health and has almost
lost his hearing. I think it is just
and right that he be pardoned." The
prosecuting attorney joined in the petition
for pardon.
A brother of Wallace, who lives in
Nebraska, sent word to the Governor
that he would take care of the convict
in case he was freed. He will
lead, he says, a quiet life on a farm
there and will molest no one.
Wallace was busy after the happy
news had been received. The prison
officials congratulated him, and he at
once started preparations to leave.
He had a considerable amount of money
loaned to prisoners and had accum-
plated some propjerty which he lis-
posed of to other inmates. Wallace
was a popular man among the cor:-
Ivicts, and was always cheerfu. In
spite of his broken health.
The convicts spent Labor Day in the
usual quiet manner. The band played
both morning and afternoon. Outside
work was suspended and a general
atmosphere of rest prevailed the big
institution.
The following account of the escape
and crime for which Wallace served
his time, taken from the Record of
Jan. 25, 1900, is interesting and will
prove especially so to people who can
vividly recall the incident;
In carrying out their plans to escape
from the penitentiary, four convicts
murdered Night Captain William
C. Rooney at the pen Monday night,
The escaped cons are Thomas Rey-
nolds, C. E. Wagner, Antone Wood and
Kid Wallace. Many things seemed to
that Wagner and his gang had
planned Indicate to let out the whole peniten-
tiary had not the alarm been given so
quickly.
The four cons mentioned were employed
that night in the boiler room.
At ten o'clock they were given their
lunch in the guard's dining room. After
eating, as Night Captain Rooney
was letting them out of the dining
room, he was grabbed by one about
the arms. A scuffle ensued, but Captain
Rooney fell, pierced through the
heart by a keen knife. The Assistant
Night Captain C. F. Maloney and Engineer
Humphrey were captured and
securely tied in the barber shop. Going
to the boiler room, one of the
cons applied a bucket of soap to the
belting which runs the electric lighting
dynamo. This threw the belt and
left the place in entire darkness. It
was then the desperate four escaped
over the back wall by means of a gas
pipe hooked over the top of the wall.
Much confussion resulted about the
pen. The warden and various officers
had heard the alarm and were soon on
the ground. But the dead night captain
had all the keys on his person on
the inside, and there was no way to
get in to find out the facts as heretofore
stated. It was thought for a while
that all the cell.houses had been opened
and the yard full of cons were waiting
to break for liberty. The alarm
had been given by the ringing of the
fire bell and blowing of the pen whistle
and several well armed citizens
soon gathered at the pen.
They were stationed on the walls
and at several good places to prevent
an outbreak.
General excitement prevailed throughout
the town. Many exagerated rumors
were afloat. It was said that the
entire penitentiary had broken out
and was coming up Main street in a
body. Both men and women about
town were scared beyond reason. A
dance in Shaeffer's hall, one of the
swell affairs, was broken up by the
night marshal, and all hurried home
for their safety, the men no doubt fear-
in ng the cons might make a raid and
disposess them of their dress suits.
Many brave(?) men stood on Beech-
er's corner, doing duty as guards and
keeping people without arms from going
nearer the scene of the supposed
battle. Some others, little more
brave, got as near the pen as Capt.
Rockafellow's home. It seemed the further
away from the pen the greater
the excitement.
A later edition of The Weekly Record
tells graphically of the greusome
aftermath of the escape. Feeling over
the killing of Night Captain Rooney
ran high. Threats of violence if he
was captured were rumored. The following
Friday night, four days after
the escape, the city fire alarm was
sounded. People ran out, expecting a
fire, but could find none. Then it was
whispered that Reynolds had been run
down near Florence and that a carriage
was bringing him back to the
pen. Guards were stationed at the
several approaches to town and a determined
mob quietly gathered at
Main and First streets. As the rig
crossed the First street bridge, two
shots, the agreed signal, rang out, announcing
the prisoner's arrival. At
the prison gate the prisoner was demanded
,, and the officers in charge,
seeing that resistance was useless,
gave the man up. He was taken to the
corner of Mais d First streets and
a noose adjusted about his neck. He
was given an opportunity to speak,
but would say nothing, except to ask
for a cigarette. The miserable man,
wan and haggard from four days of
exposure and fear, was hoisted some
ten feet in the air, then lowered and
asked if he had anything to say. Again
he refused to talk.
Then strong men drew the rope
tight and the body was lifted far up
towards the cross bars of the pole.
Here it was allowed to hang.
Not a shot was fired except the signal
of approach. The mob dispersed
in an orderly way. The next day at
noon the body was taken down and
buried the penitentiary burying
ground. in

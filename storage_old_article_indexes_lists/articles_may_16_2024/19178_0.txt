44 LYNCHINGS
TOTAL FOR 1913
LOWEST NUMBER ON RECORD,
MORE THAN FIFTY BEING RE
CORDED LAST YEAR.
Chicago, Ill., Dec. 27.- Only forty-
four lynchings, known to be such beyond
doubt, have occurred in the United
States during the year 1913. This
is the lowest number on record, more
than 50 being recorded last year and
many as 250 in some previous

negro men and one negro woman met
death. The two boys were killed by
citizens, but as they met death
the while resisting capture the case can
not strictly be elassed as one of lynching
.
In the forty- four lynchings the victims
of all but one wer√© negroes, and
all but two of the cases occurred in
Southern States. No woman was included
among the year's victims.
North Dakota and Montana were the
two Northern States in which lynchings
occurred. At Ray, N. D., Cleve
Culbertson, a white man, accused of
the murder of three persons, was
taken from jail by a mob and hanged.
The only other case in a Northern
occurred at Mondak, Mont., in
April state, when J. C. Collins, a negro, who

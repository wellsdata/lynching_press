TWO NEGROES LYNCHED
One of Them Had Confessed to
Murder and Had Implicated
the Other.
Newbern, Tenn .. Oct. 8.- Garfield
Burley and Curtis Brown, negroes,
were lynched here tonight by a mob
of 500 people. Burley on Saturday last
shot and killed D. Flatt, a young
farmer, near Dyersburg. Flatt had
traded horses with the negro, who later
asked that the trade be declared off.
Flatt refused to accede to this proposition
and while on his way home
was shot down by Burley. A posse
has been hunting the murderer and
last night located him in a negro
cabin at Huffman, Ark. While being
brought to Dyersburg Burley confessed
to the killing, implicating Cur
tis Brown as an accomplice. Both
men were lodged in jail at Dyersburg
A mob soon appeared and demanded
the prisoners. Criminal Judge Madden
made a strong plea that the law be
allowed to deal with the case, saying
that the negroes would be placed
on trial tomorrow. The mob would not
listen to this and forcibly took possession
of the two men and took them
to Newbern. The two men were taken
to a telephone pole and securely tied,
face to. At a given word they
were strung face up.

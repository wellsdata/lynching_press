Atlanta, Ga., Aug. 25( UP) -The
negro problem once more is disturbing
parts of Dixieland.
Industrial depression with consequent
unemployment, and agitation
of so- called" white supremacy" organizations
are chief among immediate
causes of present perplexity.
The underlying cause is the
economic and social situation in
many parts of the South. It is a
direct development of that day in
1619 when a Dutch trader sold 20
slaves to the colonists of Jamestown,
Virginia, thereby implanting negro
slavers as an institution which was
to endure in the United States for
nearly 250 years.
The tensity of the situation has
had expression in 10 or more lynchings
quite probably a dozen or 14-
so far this year and a number of
other demonstrations
against the
colored people which, through counsel
of cooler heads. or for other
reasons, did not end in actual
violence.
Many 1930 Lynchings
The lynching records for the year
to date already has passed that of
1929 when 10 lynching were recorded
. One can find many thoughtful
individuals who fear that the remaining
months may be worse, un-
Jess calm minds can exert a powerful
leadership.
At Tuskegee. institute, Tuskegee,
Alabama, Monroe N. Work keeps
statistics on racial outbreaks, which
are considered the nearest to official
records of extra- legal punishment
in existence. His figures show that
since 1882 there have been 1352
white persons and 3,390 negroes
ynched in the United States. Only

other in those years, gone outside
A study of the figures shows an
interesting relationship between industrial
conditions and mob violence
. In 1892 100 whites and 155
negroes were lynched and in the following
year 46 whites and 154 ne-
groes. Those were the years which
set high records for lynching. They
also were the years of financial and
industrial depression more severe
than at any time since.
Related to Prosperity
By 1896, when prosperity was returning
, lynching
dropped to 51
whites and 80 negroes and in 1900
to 8 whites and 107 negroes. By 1914
when the war boom struck industry.
the figures showed only three whites

has been downward
generally,
reaching its low level of 10 in 1929.
To understand the present state
of mind in parts of the southern
states.
one must remember that
close
to 40 per cent of the total
population south of the Mason- Dix-
on line is black. Two states. Missis-
sippi and South Carolina, are more
than 50 per cent black. In 200 counties
out of 1364 in the southern
states, negroes are in the majority.
Approximately 20 per cent of the
negroes are illiterate. There is little
provision to combat feeble- mindedness
, perverted development and in-
sanit. Those this are most often
reached through the schools and in
the case of the mentally deficient
negro he is usually the illiterate who
does not come in contact with the
school.
Some Sections Quiet
Yet the problem is not acute to
the point of violence in all parts
of the south. Virginia has not had
a lynching or other show of violence
this year. In Louisiana there has not
been a lynching more
in than 529
years. In many sections there seems
to be apparent content. South Caro-
lina and Georgia, perhaps, are the
centers of the greatest tension and
Atlanta, a city with a large industrial
population of both races and
chosen center for
racial agitation,
would appear the point of maximun
unrest. It was there that the remark
of a laborer to the United Press
correspondent may have epitomized
the present situation.
He pointed to a negro mail carrier
.
" See that fellow, the laborer said.
he's getting 60 cents an hour. Why
should that black man be getting
60 cents an hour for carrying the
United States mail while white
are out of jobs." men

Barn- Burner Lynched.
NASHVILLE, Tenn., Feb. 16.- Fred
Haynie, colored, who resided in the
vicinity of Hendersonville, Sumner
county, was taken from his home at a late
Lour last night by a mob and hanged to a
tree until he was dead. Haynie had been
strongly suspected for some time of complicity
in the burning of barns and residences
in that section, and it is said that
pretty positive proof of his guilt was
recently obtained. It is thought the mob
intended to lynch several other negroes,
who were under suspicion but failed to
,
find them at their homes. During the
past few months sixteen barns and seven
dwelling houses in Sumner county have
been destroyed by incendiaries, and much
excitement has existed in consequence.
Two negroes were recently arrested and
lodged in jail in Gallatin, to await trial a
the next term of the circuit court on the
charge of having fired the barn belonging
to a farmer near Hendersonville, who lost
several valuable horses at the time The
.
mob, after hanging Haynie, quietly dis
wife cut the body down, but found life
extinct.
The coroner held an inquest,
and a verdict of death at the hands of
unknown parties was returned.
It is
believed that the barn burners number
five or six, and that should any more
fires occur lynch law will be resorted
to. again

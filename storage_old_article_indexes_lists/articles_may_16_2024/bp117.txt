MY VIEW
Mixed Marriages In U.S.A.Mixed
By BENJAMIN E. MAYS BENJAMIN E. MAYS
There was a time when America
went to great lengths pretending to pro-
tect the "purity" of the white race and
to protect the womanhood of white wo-
men. Thirty or more states have laws
on their books prohibiting Negroes and
white people from intermarrying. Many
Negroes were lynched under the guise
protecting the" purity" of white wo
supposed to have been the first one. Since
then, the Associated Press claims, more
than a dozen mixed marriages have oc-
curred in Georgia.

Not long after becoming President
of Morehouse College in 1940, I tried to
persuade a Negro teacher that she didn't
have to leave Morehouse because she
married a white man. My view was that
the marriage was legitimate, and she
could remain at Morehouse.
The Supreme Court struck down
Virginia's law against interracial marri-
ages in June, 1967. These anti-interrac-
ial laws may never be taken off the
states' statutes, but they are dead. The
-Associated Press article estimates that
no more than 100 such marriages have
soccurred in the states-affected since the
Supreme Court rules. The article says
further that fifteen interracial marri-
ages occurred in North Carolina in 1967,
thr√©e.in, Tennessee, and six in Virginia,
Even Louisiana has had one.
Though the bars have been lifted,
I see no 'run on the bank'! The number
of interracial marriages will be in all
probability increase. But for various and
sundry reasons, I see, for the most part,
for-years to come, Negroes mainly-will-
marry Negroes and whites will marry
whites. But if interracial marriages are
to occur in large numbers, nothing can
stop it not even Black Power! Some
sociologists have predicted for a long
time that intermarriage will be the ul-
timate solution of the race problem in
the United States. Will it? -Bacism is
so deeply engrained in America that in-
termarriage may not solve the problem.

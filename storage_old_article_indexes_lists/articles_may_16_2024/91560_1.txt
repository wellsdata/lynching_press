RIVERSIDE, Nov. 14.- Thomas P.
Jones, a blacksmith of Temecula, a town
forty miles south of this city, is under arrest
, after having narrowly escaped lynching
, charged by his own daughter with the
paternity of her new- born babe.
Three months ago, Jones' daughter, who
is 22 years old, was married to D. J. Tripp.
a Temecula butcher. At the time of the
marriage, it is said, the girl confessed all
to him. When the child was born the
husband made known its real paternity
and Mrs. Tripp swore to a complaint
against her father.
Jones, hearing of this action, attempted
to escape into Mexico and had a good
start when he was apprehended at Murri-
etta, fourteen miles away, by Deputy Sheriff
Zimmerman. He returned to Temecula
pending a preliminary hearing but when
the citizens of the town heard of it, a
mob soon formed and threats of lynching
were openly made. Fearing that vengeance
might be wreaked upon the prisoner
, the officers quietly secured buggy
and spirited him away. a

McLellan Gives Opin-
Justice ion on Murder Case
Montgomery, November 21 .-( Special.)
Tom Jackson, a Clarke county negro
who was sentenced to be hanged by
the circuit court of that county for the
killing of Charles Coats, a deputy sheriff
, early in the summer of this year,
has been granted a new trial by the
supreme court in a decision handed
down by that tribunal today.
The Jackson case is considered one
of the most interesting criminal cases
that the supreme court has passed upon
in some time. Jackson was accused of
killing, or being a party to the killing,
of Deputy Sheriff Coats last summer,
which resulted in the lynching of Ben
Jackson, the father of the defendant,
by an angry mob of white citizens.
Evidence tended to show, however,
and this was the principal ground for
reversal of the case, that Coats had
been shot by Ben Jackson, who was
later lynched.
The evidence also tended to show that
Coats had to the home of the
gone
Jacksons to make an arrest without
having informed them that he was an
officer of the law; that Coats fired the
first shot, and that later the elder negro
shot the deputy with a shotgun,
killing him. Tom Jackson, the son,
ran off, was later arrested cried at
a special term of court. He was convicted
and sentenced to be hanged on
August 9, but execution of sentence
was suspended pending an appeal to the
supreme court.
Governor Ordered Investigation
Following the lynching of the negro,
Ben Jackson Governor O'Neal ordered an
investigation, of the affair, and for a time
it was thought that impeachment proceedings
would be instituted against the
Clarke- county sheriff. The investigation
did not reveal, however, that the sheriff
had really been neglectful of duty, and
the governor allowed the matter to drop.
The opinion in the Jackson case was
written by Justice T. C. McClellan, who
said:
" The sole predicate for his guilt is
sought, in the evidence to be prescribed
,
to appellant's preconcert with Ben Jack-
son, who actually fired the fatal shot, or
an aiding or abetting of Ben Jack-
to son."

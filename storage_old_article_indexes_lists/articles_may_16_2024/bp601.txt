Texas Mob
Foiled by
Sheriff
SHAMROCK, Tex., July 18.
-Ever since Governor Dan
Moody issued the order to offi-
cers protecting a prisoner last
May "not to shoot," mob and
lynch law has been roving
over the state.
Sunday following church services a
mob of approximately two hundred
nien, said to have included several
ministers, formed here, bent on re-
prisals against Race citizens, dis-
banded after armed officers threat-
ened to shoot, led by the sheriff, if
the gathering did not disperse.
Monday Sheriff W. K. McLemore
said Wheeler county authorities were
in command of the situation, which
developed after one Jesse Washington
is supposed to have beaten Mrs.
Henry Vaughn, a white woman, to
death with an iron bar.
Most of Shamrock's nonwbite
population had left town before the
mob formed Sunday, after notices
were posted in the "black distrift”
ordering them to move out before
sundown."
The moh went to the district,
threatening to burn down all the
homes and run those remaining out
of town, but the sheriff stood in front
of the houses with guns drawn, and
in some cases pushed back the bold-
est of the invaders.
The mob, robbed of their "fun" at
Shamrock, got in cars and drove more
than fifty miles to Erick, Oxla., and
with the leading citizens of that town
drove approximately twenty-five Race
families from their homes.
Mrs. Henry Vaughn, white woman,
found beaten to death Friday at her
farm home near Shamrock, formerly
lived there.
As the mob victims shatched a few
possessions and fed, the gathering
burned nearby farm property.

rangers

dis-
Monday night were
patched to Shamrock to protect citi-
zens threatened by mob violence. The
rangers were sent in response to a
request from Sheriff W. H. McLemore
of Wheeler county.
SHERMAN, Tex., July 18.—Rushed
out of Texas to avert mob violence.
Jesse Lee Washington was held last
week at the state reformatory at
Granite, Okla., where officers said he
confessed slaying of Mrs. Henry
Vaughn, a white woman, near here
Friday.
Washington was moved just in time
to avert the fate which came to two
others here this year. The same mob
which staged the other demonstra-
tions was headed for the city jail
where Washington was being held.
when officers, "without any order
from Gov. Dan Moody" to the con-
trary, rushed him to Oklahoma and
civilization.
Advices from Granite said Wash-
ington confessed in the presence of
District Attorney James C. Mahan
and County Attorney Lee Gribble.
Mrs. Vaughn was assaulted and beat-
en to death at her home.
Sheriff Claude McKinney outdis-
tanced the mob, which raced him 10
the Oklahoma line to gain custody of
the prisoner.

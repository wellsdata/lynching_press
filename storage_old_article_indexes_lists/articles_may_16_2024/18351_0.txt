BLACK LEGALLY HUNG
Adopted a Ruse to Save Him
Sheriff From Being Lynched.
Belair, Md., Aug. 31.- William
Black, colored, was hanged at 7:41 a.
m. He met death with considerable
calmness, although he was very ner-
vous on his way to the scaffold and for
several days was in a state bordering
on complete collapse.
Black died for a criminal assault
committed on Miss Jessie Bradford, a
15- year- old girl, who lived near Aber
deen, this county. The negro over-
powered her in a patch of woods Feb
ruary 21. A searching party was organized
and there is no doubt the
have been lynched
would if
negro
caught then, but he made his way to
Baltimore, shipped on an oyster boat
and was caught down the bay a few
days later. His arrest and conviction
followed and he was kept at the Bal
timore city jail
Meanwhile another negro, Louis
Miller was lynched in Belair for a
similar crime and threats were made
that Black should never die a legal
death. For this reason the sheriff of
Harford county took unusual precau-
tions and a company of militia was detailed
to attend the execution and pre-
serve order. As a further precaution,
the announcement was made in the
newspapers that the condemned man
would be taken to Belair on a morn-
ing train and hanged soon after 10 a.
m. Instead of carrying out this program
, the sheriff put him on a train
which reached here from Baltimore
after midnight and hanged
shortly him at the hour stated.

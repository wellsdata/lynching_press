The four pas hanged were:
Sanders, the who fired the shot that
killed Mr. Orrrilla Weaver, the mother
of Sanders arpok in the Orr household;
Dennis Reco the" hood and
conjurer" whied to poison Mr. Orr with
boiled snake ds, and Manse Castle, who
volunteered to the job and transferred
it to Sander
Miss RacMorris, accused of being an
accessory re the fact, and Susie Ja
cobs, a neg woman, accessory after the
fact, have pped out, and their whereabouts
are known to the officers. Had
they been jail they would have undoubtedly
gone th the rest last night.
Mrs. Orfife of the murdered man, was
in the coor of the jail last night when
the mob ered. She had taken something
with suicl intent, and Dr. P. E. Thomas,
who waslled to care for her, says she
will die.
leers of the mob examined Mrs.
Orr critlly and passed her, but many of
them fared taking her with the rest. Her
death gns to be but a matter of a few
hours. she recovers, it is stated that the
mob w hang her.
Ther's no doubt that the report that
Mrs. would certainly die moved the
popule to the lynching last night. Three
previc demonstrations were made and
each ne the crowd dispersed on the promise
one officers to rush the trial without
a chge of venue or any delay in the
proclings whatever. It was even said
that legal execution would be had during
the eek.
Lt night only the jailer and two dep
uti R. F. Milwee and A. F. Howard,
we at the jail, it being felt that the law
wdd be allowed to take its course. Mr.
Mvee made an earnest effort to prevent
th mob from taking his prisoners, going
sfar as to give out the statement that
hhad twenty- five guards behind him and
vuld certainly order them to fire should
attempt at forcing the door be made.
he crowd hesitated a moment, parleyed a
hort while and then forced the outer door.
Ar. Milwee, seeing further resistance would
be useless, turned over the keys and unlocked
the combination door to the cells.
The negroes were hanged from the elevated
tramway of the Halpern sawmill,
where they remained until 9 a. m. to- day.
Great crowds viewed the grewsome sight
of a woman and three men dangling six
feet from the ground with tongues protruding
and ropes cutting deep into their necks.
The negroes seem to indorse the lynching
and many of them are open in their expressions
of satisfaction over the death
of Dennis Record, whose art of" hoodoo"
and" conjuring" made him an object of
dread and fear to them.
It appears from letters received by Mrs.
Orr, in the name of her cook, Lorilla
Weaver, through whom all the correspondence
was conducted, that Mrs. Orr and
Rachel Morris were to remain here until
Mr. Orr's insurance money was collected,
and then go to New York, where they were
to meet, two men and form a theatrical
company. Mrs. Orr was also in correspondence
with other men. A letter came in the
mail this morning which reads as follows:
" Caldwell, O., August 6, 1898.
" Dear Lorilla: -Inclosed you will find a
picture of me as I was on the 2nd day of
August, 1898. Another matter has been
brought to my attention since I wrote
you last, and that is that our common pleas
court convenes on September 5, and I hardly
see how I can get away in the month
of September. Perhaps it would suit you to
defer until October. Let me hear from you
in regard to the matter. However, if you
cannot defer it until October, I think I
can arrange matters all right, but if it
would be more convenient for you to defer
it until October, I could stay longer with
you, as I would have all my court affairs
attended to for the September term.
" Trusting that you will be pleased with
Opie's Real" Kid" mayor, I am still, yours,
" ARTHUR O. ARCHER."
This letter is accompanied by a photo
graph of the" Real Kid Mayor." indorsed
on the back," Arthur, to Lorilla." Lorilla
is the negro woman who cooked for the
Orrs. Apparently Mrs. Orr carried on all
this sort of correspondence in Lorilla's
name.
The people are sorry that they were so
terribly imposed upon by this woman, who
was admitted to the first homes of the
town, given a prominent place in church
work and very consideration generally accorded
good people. They are sorry that
so fearful a crime was enacted here and
that such violent measures were adopted
to avenge it, but all are agreed that the
guilty have been found, and that they deserved
the end they met.
Mrs. Orr was Miss Mabel Parker, formerly
of Wisconsin.
A coroner's jury was impaneled to- day
and rendered a verdict that the
were killed by unknown parties. deceased

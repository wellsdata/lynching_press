VARDAMAN A LIKEABLE MAN.
The Personality of Mississippi's New
Senator is Attractive.
" I will make the prediction that before
Senator Vardaman has been long
in the senate he will be liked by his
associates, and his reputation as a
fire eater will have vanished," was the
statement made by C. T. Wilson of
Cornith, a prosperous planter of Mis-
sissippi, who knows the new colleague
of John Sharp Williams personally.
" Mr. Vardaman is more or less spectacular
in his campaigning, and one is
inclined not to like him at first. But
that impression is removed when you
come to know him better. He has a
charming personality, is a well read,
scholarly man ,, a capital story teller
and good conversationalist. He talks
with his mouth open. There is no
whispering with Vardaman. When
he has an opinion on a subject he
does not hesitate to say what it is,
and he has the courage of his convictions
at all times. Personally, he
is a man of striking appearance. He
wears his hair long, cut in the old
fashioned block shape, and it is as
black as a raven's wing. His eye is
kee nand alert. If I were to use any
simile I would say he looks like an
eagle. In dress he is always immaculate
.
" The public conception of Senator
Vardaman is gained from his talk
about lynching, and yet he would not
hesitate to fight the mob single handed
if he believed the mob was in
the wrong. It will be remembered
that when he was governor he not
only sent a company of troops to prevent
a negro from being lynched, but
went to the scene personally, and did
more than any other one man to prevent
the mob from wreaking its
vengeance upon its chosen victim. He
is a man of quick impulses and a
man of action. As an orator he is
able, and I predict that he will make
his mark in the senate. The Varda-
man known at long range and the
Vardaman personally known are two
different individuals."- Wash-
ington very Post.

Stabbing Affray at Monroe.
A stabbing affray occurred at Mon-
roe on the afternoon of the 30th that
may result in murder. Wm. Stokes,
colored, stabbed William Rudert, a
butcher, with a putty knife during an
altercation in Jacob Hermann's saloon,
on Monroe street. The men had been
drinking heavily all day and at the
time of the trouble both were intoxicated
and quarrelsome. The knife en-
tered between the two lower ribs on
the left side and went through the
lung and into the spleen. Stokes was
immediately arrested. In the mean
time a crowd had collected at the police
station with the determination to
break into Stokes' cell and take him
out and hang him to a tree in the park.
While the crowd was raving outside
the officers took Stokes out of the back
door of the station house and down the
alley to the county jail, where he is
confined awaiting the result of
now Rudert's injuries.

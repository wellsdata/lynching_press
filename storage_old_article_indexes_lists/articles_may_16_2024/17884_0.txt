Mob Kilis Negro.
LARRMIE, Wyo .-- Joe Martin,
colored, was lynched by a mob of 300
men in front of Judge Carpenter's
house. Martin was a trusty in the
county jail. He attacked a white
girl, Della Krause, in the jail kitchen
and slashed her face and arms with
knife. One man was injured by
Martin when entering the jail to
drag out the prisoner.
After assaulting Miss Krause with
a razor Martin was placed in a cell
in the county jail. At night a mobient
of several hundred formed outside
the jail. The first intimation Sheriff
Cook had of the contemplated lynching
was when two masked men appeared
in the kitchen of the jail
house and with guns leveled at his
head told him that there were 200
men waiting outside for the negro
and that he had better not attempt
to make any trouble for them. In
the meantime another masked man
ad entered, and while the first two
held the sheriff the third man took
the keys of the jail from the sheriff's
pocket and then the three started
for the negro's cell.
On the they encountered
way
Myer, who had been summoned to
dress the wounds of Martin, self- inflicted
, with the same razor with
which he had assaulted the girl and
,
Turnkey Jones. He was compelled
to stand against the cage of the cells
with his face turned away from the
mob. The negro was then taken
from his cell and hurriedly marched
through the court house into the
street. Arriving at the lamp post
a short distance from the hall the
negro was quickly strung up to the
post. During the entire proceedings
he did not speak nor attempt to resist
the mob. The lynching occur
red at 8 o'clock and within
an hour about the streets were deserted.

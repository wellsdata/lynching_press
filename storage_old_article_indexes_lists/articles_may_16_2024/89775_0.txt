thority of law."
The definition of lynching is:" Any act of
violence exercised by such mob upon the
body of any person which shall cause the
death of such person shall constitute the
crime of lynching,' and any person who
participates in, or aids, or abets such lynching
, upon conviction thereof, shall suffer
death or be imprisoned in the State Prison
during life, in the discretion of the jury."
The second section provided that" any person
who shall, after the commission of the
crime of lvnching, harbor, conceal or assist
any member of a mob who participates in
or aids or abets such a crime, with the intention
that he shall escape detention, arrest
, capture or punishment, shall be deemed
to be and shall be an accessory after the
fact, and may be charged, tried and convicted
and punished, though such member be
neither charged, tried nor convicted, and
upon conviction shall be subject to imprisonment
in the State Prison for from two to
twenty- one years."
Section 3 provided that" any person accused
of the crime of lynching or of being
an accessory may be prosecuted either by
indictment or upon information based on the
affidavit of some competent and reputable
person. The widow or children of a person
killed by a mob, by either direct lynching
or in an attempt to lynch another person,
shall be enttitled to recover$ 5,000 from the
county in which the lynching occurs as a
penalty for the unlawful killing" The bill
continued as follows:" The action for the
recovery of this amount may be begun in
any court of general jurisdiction in the
county where the lynching occurred, at any
time within two years of the time of the
lynching. The county in which any lynching
occurs shall have a right of action to
recover the amount of any judgment, with
costs, rendered against it, in favor of the
personal representative of any person
lynched by a mob, against any of the persons
composing the mob. In case a mob
shall carry a person into another county
and there lynch him, or shall come from another
county and lynch a person brought
from such county for safe keeping the
county in which the lynching was committed
may recover from the county from which
the mob came, as a penalty, a sum equal to
the amount of the original judgment and
costs, unless there was contributory negligence
on the part of the officials of the
county in which the lynching occurred in
failing to protect the person so lynched,
" In case any persons shall come together
in any county for the purpose of proceeding
to another county with the view of lynching
any person, or in case any person or persons
shall purchase or procure any rope,
weapon or other instrument in one county
for the purpose of being used in lynching
any person in another county, such crime of
lynching, if committed, shall be and constitute
a continuous offense from the time
of its original inception, and the courts of
any county in which any such overt act has
been committed shall have jurisdiction over
the person of any member of the mob committing
the overt act, and such person may
be prosecuted in such county and punished
for murder the same as if the lynching had
occurred therein. If any person shall be
taken from the hands of the officer or officers
having such person in custody and shall be
lynched, it shall be prima facie evidence of
failure on the part of such officer or officers
to do their duty, and it shall thereupon be
the duty of the prosecuting attorney and
attorney general to at once institute impeachment
proceedings against such officer
or officers pursuant the laws in force
concerning impeachment to of officers."

OMAHA, Oct. 22- A special to the Bee
from Stromsburg, Neb., says: A large and
well developed sensation broke out last
evening in the neighborhood of Osceolo.
It is reported here that the
Women's Christian Temperance Union
organized itself into a White
Cap Society for the purpose of chastising
several resident young women whose reputation
for chastity is not above reproach.
Last night, by the use of decoys, the
White Caps succeeded in entrapping
the victims, and according to the
best information one of the victims was
flogged into insensibility. while two
others escaped with the clothing torn from
their persons and somewhat braised.
Eleven perpetrators were recognized and
at once arrested. Some of them are out on
bail and are in jail. The trial is
set for tomorrow others.

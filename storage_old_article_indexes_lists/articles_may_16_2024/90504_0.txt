TRAGEDY IN ST. LOUIS.
Mob Tries to Lynch a Negro Who Had
Shot a White Man.
A murder that almost added a lynching
with it occurred at St. Louis the other
night. Edward Kennedy, a railroad man,
was passing a saloon and stopped on the
sidewalk a moment. The negro porter ordered
him to move on. Kennedy started
slowly, which enraged the negro, who
pulled a revolver and Kennedy
shot
through the forehead. As he fell the negro
ran. A number of pedestrians witnessed
the murder and at once gave chase
with cries of" Lynch him." A police officer
outdistanced the mob and caught the
negro, holding the crowd at bay with his
revolver until a patrol wagon was sum-
' moned. Kennedy was not dead when
picked up. He was placed in an ambu-
lance and hurried to the hospital. The
ambulance broke down on the way, throwing
the dying man into the street. He
was quickly placed on a dray and the
journey continued but he died before the
hospital was reached,.

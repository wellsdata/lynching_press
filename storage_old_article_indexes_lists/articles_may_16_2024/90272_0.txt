COWERING IN HIS CELL
The Fate Overhanging a Young
Rancher.
Butte, Mont., Aug. 4.- A special to
the Miner from Lewiston, Ida., says the
jail at Asotin Wash is surrounded by
two or three hundred people determined
to lynch Wm. Hamilton, a young
rancher, who confessed to having taken
thirteen- year- old Mabel Richards into
the thicket and after assaulting her,
beat her brains out with a heavy club.
A contingent is expected momentarily
from Anatone, the scene of the crime,
and when it arrives an assault, it is
said, will be made on the jail. The
excitement is at white heat and Hamil-
ton is reported to be cowering in his
cell in dead fear.
Special deputies are on guard at the
jail, but their number will be be of
little weight against the heavy crowd
forming outside. The mob
appears to
lack a leader. One report has it that
lynching of Hamilton has been
planned the for midnight.

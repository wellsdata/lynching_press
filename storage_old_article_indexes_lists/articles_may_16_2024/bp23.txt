LynchingsLouisiana's Unpunished
Lynchings
The National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People seems
to have decidedly the better of the
controversy with Louislana authorities
over the state's failure to punish
lynching. The association; in a tele-
gram protesting against the lynching
of the Negro McNeel in the courthouse
yard at Monroe, La., alluded to its
previous protests respecting the lynch-
ing of four other Negroes and asked if
the Baton Rouge Chamber of Com-
merce "stands for law and order or
mob violence." The secretary of the
chamber having replied that the ques-
tion was "an insult" and that "Gov.
Pleasant's acts as executive, man of
character and law-abiding
citizen are above reproach," the asso-
ciation now answers:
patriotic
:
"What we ask is a statement from
him and from representative organiza-
tions such as yours as to what steps
Louisiana proposes to take to vindi-
cate her law in face of the fact that
five Negroes have been lynched, in
Louisiana within seven weeks.. Legal
action and not rhetoric is what the oc-
casion demands."
That is the point of the whole mat:
ter: What is the governor of Louisi--
ana doing to vindicate the outraged
law of the state and to punish the mob
murders that stain its honor? Lynch-
ing will cease in the South when its.
authorities, resolutely punish lynchers
for their crime against the law.-Edi-

Cannot Indorse Mob Law.
" I have come to this conclusion from
past utterances of Senator Tillman on
the race question and from his expressed
determination to reiterate
them. He has said that he would advocate
violence, mob law, lynching or
assassination, according to the best information
I have been able to obtain.
For the mayor of a city to countenance
any such thing by his presence
would be worse than improper. I had
reached the conclusion I would not be
present at the meeting before I was
asked to preside. A delegation of negro
citizens asked me to prohibit the
lecture and I refused. I believe in free
speech, unless the exercise of that
speech would result in tumult disorder
, loss of life, or serious injury,."

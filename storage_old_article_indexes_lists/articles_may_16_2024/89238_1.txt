The murdered child's father, Robert
W. Frost returned to Denver yester-
,
day from the scene of the lynching.
" A great load has been lifted from
us," said he," and as for me, I don't
care who condemns me for starting
the blaze. No other father will have
to do what I did on account of that
nigger, and, as I said before, if the
brute had been lynched for his first
offense in Kansas, my baby would be
alive today our hearts would not
be broken." and

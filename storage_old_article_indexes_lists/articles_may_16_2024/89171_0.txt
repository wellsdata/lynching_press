NEGRO MURDERER
MAY BE LYNCHED
Lima, O., May 24.- Rumors that a mob
was forming with the intention of lynching
John W. Beam, the negro attorney
under arrest here on the charge of murdering
Mrs. Maud Diltz Sunday night,
caused Sheriff Van Gunten to remove his
prisoner from the city hospital to the
county jail, tonight. En route to the jail
the prisoner was taken past the house
in which, the body of Mrs. Diltz lies.
Beam is now in the strongest cell in
the jail and a strong guard is being maintained
about him. Electric lights have
been hung around the prisoner's, cell so
that no one can approach without being
seen. Officers on guard have been instructed
to fire Ãºpon the first person
who attempts any violence.
Residents of Waynesfield, the former
home of Mrs. Diltz, are said to be great-
ily excited over the murder.
One report received by the sheriff is
that the murdered woman's grandfather
has threatened to avenge the murder and
hundreds of his friends have expressed
their willingness to aid in storming the
jail and lynching Beam.
U. S. Beam, a brother of the prisoner,
and a wealthy citizen of Lima, clo.is
office and left for his old home in Ken-
tuucky today .. Negroes urged him to
leave as they feared he might be lynched
if he remained here.
Feeling ran high
against him.
Beam's wife is a white woman and this
aided in infuriating the residents against
him. Physicians say the self- inflicted
wounds of Beam will not prove fatal.
Vernon Diltz, brother of the murdered
woman, told the police tonight that Beam
threatened to kill Mrs. Diltz last Fri-
day. Mrs. Diltz told her brother she
promised Beam she would be friendly
with him if he would spare her life
thus she escaped death. and

Another Flagrant Example
Of Lawlessness in Georgia
violence,
A
N outbreak of mob
more atrocious than usual, occurred
near Milan, Ga., in Telfair
county. May 24 two white men are
said to have invaded the negro section
of the town and threatened several
families. According to one report
they were seeking negro women.
Berry Washington, a negro 72 years
old, came out of his house with a
shotgun and after an altercation there
was an exchange of shots in which
one of the white men was killed.
Washington surrendered and was put
in jail in a nearby town. Two days
later he was taken out of jail by a
mob, hanged to a post and then shot.
A particularly ugly feature of the
affair is the charge made in an At-
lanta newspaper that an official of
Telfair county tried to keep news of
the lynching out of print, on the ground
that publication would make it more
difficult to arrest members of the
mob. There seems to have been some
connivance between the authorities
and the mob, or a shameful indifference
, since it was not until a few days
ago that the lynching became widely
known.
However, the governor of Georgia
has offered a reward of$ 1000 for the
arrest and conviction of the lynchers
and a physician of Atlanta, whose
family home was in Telfair county,
added$ 500. The prompt and ef-
fective has way in which Governor Kilby
dealt with the Bay Minette lynchers
should commend itself to Governor
Dorsey of Georgia, even though the
victim in this case was a negro and
the man lynched at Bay Minette was
white. There should be no distinction
made ..
1 The aged negro, from all appearances
, was simply trying to defend
his home against white ruffians. He
surrendered and trusted himself to
that protection which the law presumably
gives to all citizens, white
black. Because Washington was a
negro he was taken out and lynched
and there is no evidence that an attempt
was made by those in authority
to protect him.
With such outrages of frequent occurrence
in the southern states, we
might as well quit. talking about the
horrors of bolshevism in Russia and
lawlessness in Mexico until we
our own house in order. put

HANGED ON SAME GALLOWS.
Five Negro Members of an Oathbound Organization
Expiate the Murder of
Two White Officers.
Sylvania, Ga., June 15.- The hanging
of five men upon the same gallows
at the same moment here yesterday
marked the end of what is thought
to have been an organized gang of
murderers The
men executed
.
were
Arnold
Augustus Andrew
, Davis,
Richard Sanders, William Hudson and
Samuel Baldwin, all negroes The
.
victims of their crime were Constable
Mears and Fillmore Herrington,
whom they ambushed and shot to
death, and Capt. Wade, whom they
seriously wounded. On at least two
occasions efforts were made to lynch
the murderers, but by the prompt action
of the officers of the law they
were frustrated. On one of these ocurge
casions the governor found it necessary
to order out three companies of
the state militia.
These five negroes were convicted
of a murder committed under an alleged
criminal conspiracy by an organized
band of blacks known as
" Knights of the Archer." The motto
of the organization, it is said, was
" Death to the Whites." The murder
for which the men died was but the
culmination of a long series of crimes.
It is common report that the charter
of this oath- bound organization was
signed in blood and the leader, An
drew McKinney, assembled his band
only at night, when he swore them,
with awesome rites, to secrecy
to deeds of death and robbery. and

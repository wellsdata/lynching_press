Amazing Exhibition of
Lawlessness in Omaha
A
N attempt to lynch the mayor
of Omaha, that almost succeeded
, makes the recent outbreak of
mob violence in the Nebraska city an
example of lawlessness that is almost
without parallel in the United States.
There have been lynchings before
that resembled the Omaha disturbance.
Jails have been assaulted and set on
fire and the usual scenes of disorder
have occurred, but when was a 1ope
ever placed around the neck of the
mayor of a large American city and
that official so badly mistreated that
he lay for hours unconscious in a hospital
, merely because he tried to uphold
the law, as he was under oath to
?
According to newspaper reports, the
sheriff and other officers at Omaha,
aided by firemen, struggled manfully
to check the mob and protect their
prisoner from the mob, all of which
was most commendable. As for Mayor
Smith, there can be no doubt that he
acted in a courageous and honorable
manner He narrowly escaped death
for trying. to do his duty.

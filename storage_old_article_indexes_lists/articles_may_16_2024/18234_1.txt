Hungry Workers Tried
to Get Food
BYCRUS, Ohio, Jan. 25.- More
than 7,000 boss- minded persons are
attempting to form themselves into
a lynch mob to lynch three Negro
workers here who defended them
selves from being brutalized by a
local sheriff when they were accused
of stealing food.
One of three brothers was killed by
a member of the mob. The workers
saw that they were about to be
lynched and one attempted in a desperate
attempt to escape. A
detective shot the Negro worker railroad.

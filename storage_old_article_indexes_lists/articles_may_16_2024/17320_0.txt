Horrid Cruelty --& Slave Burned to
Death.
A mob was collected together and a Lynch
Court was held to determine what was best to
be done with a negro who had the impuder ce to
raise his hand against a white man. The Lynch
Court decided that he should be burned at the
stake. A Natchez paper, The Free Trader,
giving an account of it, says the negro was
taken and chained to a tree, immediately on
the banks of Mississippi, on what is called Un.
ion Point. Faggots were then collected and
iled round him, to which he appeared quite indifferent
. When the work was completed, he
was asked what he had to say. He then warned
all to take example by tin, and asked the
prayers of all around. He then called for a
drink of water, which was handed him; he
drank it and said:" Now I am ready to go in
peace." The torches were lighted and placed
in the pile. which was soon ignited. Ile watched
unmoved the curling flame, that grew until
it began to entwine itself around and fix upon
his body, and then he sent forth cries of agony,
painful to the ear, begging some one to blow
his brains out, at the same ti.ne struggling with
almost superhuman strength, until the staple
with which the chain was fastened to the tree
( not being well secured) drew out, and he leaped
from the burning pile. At that moment, the
sharp ringing of several rifles were heard, and
the body of the negro fell a corpse on the ground.
He was picked up by some two or three, and
again thrown into the fire and consumed, not a
Vestige remaining to show that such
a being
ever existed. Nearly four thousand slaves were
collected from the plantations in the neighborhood
to witness this scene. Numerous speeches
were made by the magistrates and ministers
of religion, to the large concourse of slaves,
warning them, and telling them that the same
fate awaited them if they should prove
lious to their owners. rebel-

The lynching of Raymond Bird
in Wythe county jail at Wytheville
Sunday morning, August 15, by a
mob of 50 masked men has drawn
a vigorous and practically unani-
tration of justice which would
justify an indignant citizenry
in refusing to await the legal-
ized execution of the court's
sentence imposed after a jury
had rendered its verdict. On
the contrary, the courts of
Virginia without exception to
their promptness and by their
high character have earned
the confidence of the people,
and there was no reason to be-
lieve that in the trial of the
Wytheville Negro there would
be any exception.
*
"It is a sorry and a horrify-
ing recital. Unless and until
it be proved otherwise, let all
Wytheville's best citizenry be
absolved from knowledge of
or participation in the lawless
orgy of death and inflamed
passions. And for the sake of
their own community, and for
the sake of Virginia let them
press for a special jury to in-
vestigate this attack on law
and order, and for the punish-
ment of those who thus have
dared to refuse their trust to
the courts and in their place
have exalted the bullet, the
rope and the torch."

record of the Commonwealth that

Those re-

"The writing of the final chap-

squarely with the officials and citi-

The Roanoke World-News, which
very pointedly adds:
:
"They should remember that
North Carolina, on several oc-
casions, has turned criticism
into praise by investigating
thoroughly, such outrages and
by inflicting heavy punishment
upon the offender. The offi-
cials of Wythe County should
go about their task as cour-
ageously as North Carolina
officials have done. They
must go to the bottom of this
mess, and see that the guilty
parties pay the penalty for the
stigma which they have placed
on Virginia's good name."
Times-Herald
Taking issue with a paper pub-
lished in Southwest Virginia which
attempts to find some justifitation
for the lynching, the Newport
News Times-Herald comments, "If
the Negro in the Wythe County jail
had been spared by the mob, and
brought to trial by a jury of his
peers, there is no doubt in the
mind of any man in Wythe or else-

course, that the evidence was suf-
ficient to convict him. So there

to the other the dailies have in un-

Virginian-Pilot
For instance, the Norfolk Vir-
ginian-Pilot declares:
"Virginia
gets another black
mark in the lynching record as a
result of the gruesome exploit of a
mob of masked men at Wytheville
early Sunday morning," and con-
tinues, "No more barbarous exhi-
bition of the mob spirit has been
reported from any State in many
a month." The Virginian-Pilot be-
lieves that with proper police dili-
gence the members of the mob can
be brought to boot and in that con-
nection says:
"The gang that disgraced
Virginia with one of the black-
est mob crimes in its history
has its habitat in a relatively
restricted area in Wythe Coun-
ty. The apprehension of many
of its members is merely a
question of police diligence.

The Lynchburg News feels that
the crime "blackens the reputation
of that section and in a few hours
undoes much of the good so la-
boriously accomplished." "South-
west Virginians," The News con-
tinues, "should ask themselves if
it would not be better for them

Wytheville's crime were punished
and punished so quickly and so
adequately as to prevent its repe-
tition."

Rights whose adoption was so
recently celebrated in Wil-

principle that no person shall

that every man accused of a

trial by an impartial jury of
his vicinage, to be confronted
with his accusers and to call
for evidence in his favor.
The members of that mob
had no consideration for the
State and its laws and the
rights of the prisoner, nor had
they any consideration for the
rest of their fellow citizens in
Wythe and in the State at
large. They knew that the
lynching would be used against
the county and State by focs

the country. They knew that
in the lynching records of 1926
the lynching in Wythe would

But they had no consideration.
They cared not for the effect
which their lawlessness would
have on their fellow citizens.
They thought of nothing but
their own revenge..
Now, then, why should the
authorities of the county and
the State have any considera-
tion for them? Why should
they not be apprehended and
called to account?
The only
way that the county and the
State can clear themselves of
this stigma is to apprehend
those reckless, inconsiderate
men and bring them to the bar
of justice. It is a duty which

in the Nor-

folk Ledger-Dispatch
clares, “It is a crying shame and a
humiliation that Virginia which for
many years maintained the clear-
est record in respect to lynchings
in the South, should now have
scrawled and seared across her
name another instance of this in-
defensible practice," and utters
this loathsome arraignment of the
perpetrators, 'Anyone who is
known to have taken part in su
a lynching, and done this bitter evil
to the State that is his home,
should be shunned as a leper by
all good people, for a moral leper
he is, and it would take a world
of expiation to wash his spirit
clean." Demanding that the lynch-
ers be caught and punished, the
Ledger-Dispatch concludes:
"In justice to the state and
all its citizens, no stone should
be left unturned to learn the
identity of these cowardly
masked culprits, as far as it
may be possible to learn it,
and bring them to stern jus-
tice. Whether or not success
attends this effort, a thorough
and complete investigation can
at once be made into the con-
duct of the jailer and all other
officials concerned with the
safeguarding and integrity of
the violated jail. If any of
them are found to have been
in the least degree negligent
or derelict in their duty of
doing all that men could do to
repel the onslaught of the mob,
they should be instantly dis-
missed. That is the very least
that can be done, but the sting
and the disgrace remain."

The Richmond News Leader sees
the lynching as "A Dark Disgrace
to Virginia," and, assailing it un-
der the caption, that paper strikes
this regretful note: "Has Virginia

miliating story than that set forth
in these extracts of the Associatel

The Petersburg Progress-Index
is of the opinion that Wythe
County can do much to remove the
stigma which the mob has cast
upon it. It can bring such pres-
sure to bear upon the Common-
wealth's Attorney and other offi-
cials that they will be forced to
make resolute efforts to convict
those responsible for this high-
handed attack upon the law." But
the Progress-Index is not over-
confident that anything will be
done about the lynching and in this
connection observes:
1
the authorities owe to the Com-
monwealth and to the great
body of law-abiding citizens of
Virginia who are opposed to
lynch law and who demand
that every citizen, whatever
may be his race or his station
in life, shall have his rights
in a court of justice, when-
ever, if ever, he is accused of
a crime."
Progressive-Index
'
"But nothing is risked in
saying that Wythe county will
not do this. Nothing is risked
in prophesying that no indict-
ments will be returned as a re-
sult of this mob outrage. It is
probably true that a hundred
witnesses could be summoned
who could give the names of
leaders of the mob and who
would do so unless willing to
perjure themselves or go to
jail for refusal to testify. So
the stigma placed upon Wythe,
not by "sensational newspa-
pers, ," but by a handful of
Wythe county citizens, will re-
main--for years to come. It
could be wiped out in very
large degree, but it will not
bo."
Times-Dispatch
The Richmond Times-Dispatch is
of the opinion that "Wytheville
stands indicted before the bar of
public opinion and Virginia, be-
cause of Wytheville, stands indiet-
ed before the country as a State
in which the despicable crime of
lynching is permitted to continue."
The Times-Dispatch then says:
"In permitting-or in fail-
ing to prevent this lawless ex-
ccution of a prisoner-Wythe-
ville has openly outraged law
and order and it has betrayed
its lack of confidence in its
duly constituted courts. That
is the real pity of this latest
lynching. The real danger in
such mob murders. It is an
attack upon the courts which
in Virginia is not justified.
The crime laid at the door of
the Negro is one that white
people and to their credit the
same may be said of most col-
ored people do not tolerate.
But there has been in recent
years no miscarriage of jus-
tice in the courts that would...
inflame the people of any com-
munity to seize the adminis-
was no excuse for mob law in that
case.
In another editorial the same
journal adds:
"Southwest Virginia is mak-
ing giant strides in the march
of progress, and it has been
receiving a great deal of valu-
able publicity. But the dis-
graceful, brutal, savage lynch-
ing of a colored man in the
Wytheville jail is a setback to
the entire region. That man
was murdered. No matter how
fiendish his crime may have
been, he was entitled to a fair
trial in a court of justice, for
that is a right guaranteed in
the Constitution of the State
and the Constitution of the
United States. Lynching him
by a mob was in defiance of
the laws of man and the laws
of God, and it is a reflection on
the character of the Common-
wealth. The members of the
'mob must be run down, ex-
posed and brought to the bar
of justice."
Daily Press
The Herald's home contempo-
rary, the Newport News Daily
Press, speaks out in unmistakably
denunciatory terms of the lynching
under the caption, "Inconsiderate
Lynchers." The Daily Press says:
"Thinking alone of their
own grievance, fifty citizens of
one neighborhood in the coun-
ty of Wythe took the law in
their own hands and lynched
a prisoner who was in the cus-
tody of the State. In so do-
ing they defied their govern-
ment and broke the laws of
God and man. They broke

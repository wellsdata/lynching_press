BALTIMORE, Md.-While lynch mobs
with ropes in their hands continue
tramping up and down the Eastern
Bhore of Chesapeake Bay searching
Jails for Negro farm workers, Governor
Albert C. Ritchle and President Hoover
have ignored demands of the Interna-
tional Labor Defense for protection of
workers and I.L.D.,

b Washington officials report in the
Ealtimore press that Hoover will take
no action. Governor Ritchle states that
he is "continually bothéred by this or-
ganization, and I didn't know what they
expect me to do."
This is officialdom's reply to I. L. D.,

allas Orphan Jones, 60-year-old farm
hand, faced with a charge of murder,

The I.L.D., has since compelled the
court to recognize Ades as the attorney
chosen by Lee to defend him.
The presa records new attacks on
Negro farmers and workers along this
area. The I.L.D., is fighting this reign
of terror by organization, arousing
public opinion, and legal defense.
Meanwhile the game of passing the
buck, continues between officials ap-
pealed to by the I.L.D. Hoover's repre-
sentatives say "this is a matter of state
and local officials." The governor says
he doesn't know what he can do. And
the local police say they "cannot cope
with the situation."
Because, he states, Govemor Ritchle
has falled to take action against the
open activities of a lawless mob on the
Eastern Shore. Louis Berger, secretary
of the International Labor Defenso,
wired President Hoover an appeal to
put down mob violence in Maryland,
Wednesday of last week.
The wire to the President followed
the rushing of George Davis, accused
of an attack on a white woman, to
the Baltimore City Jail, after a mob
et 500 whites searched for him in
three jalls.
Hearing Friday
Bernard Ades. attorney for Yucl Lee,
will petition the circult court at Snow
Hill Friday to have the trial of the
accused man changed to Baltimore. Mr.
Ades stated that if the court did
grant the written request, he would
go to Snow Hill at a later dato to
argue the motion.
James Watson, of Philadelphia, dis-
trict organizer of the League for the
Struggle of Negro Rights, is in the
city aiding the I.L.D., in its fight for
Yuel Lee. Mr. Watson hopes to or-
ganize v'orkers in every block to send
protests to the officials and urge that
Lee be given a fair and impartial trial.
A combined Scottsboro and Yuel Lee
conference will be called by the two
organizations in the near futuro.
The telegram sent to President Hoo-
ver by Mr. Berger follows:
"Terror and mob violence are ram-
pant in the State of Maryland. Gov-
ernor Ritchie and all officials of state
giving encouragement to mobs.
ternational Labor Defense demands
that you protect Negro citizens and
guarantee their rights and safety."
Bergar explained that his action in
calling on the Federal government was
made as a result of "Governor Ritch-
ie's continued refusal to quell mob vio-
lence on the Eastern Shore."
Meanwhile, belief that further mob
violence will result if George Davis is
brought back to Chestertown, Md., for
trial was expressed by Sheriff John
Vickers, of Kent County.
In-
Telegram to Ritchie
Prior to the Hoover telegram, Mr.
Berger also sent a telegram to Gov-
ernor Ritchie following the Davis out-
break. The telegram follows:
"Result of your failure arrest mob

times tried lynch Orphan Jones now

Byrd. Snow Hill. Now confident

residents Kent, Queen Anne, and Cecil
Counties searched jail, ropa in hand,
for George Davis, Negro citizen, not
convicted of any crime. White and
Negro workers demand you arrest lead-
ers on Eastern Shore, arrest leaders

tertown mob. Jones must be moved to
Baltimore.”
Representatives of the IL.D., sald
that they had not yet determined what
course they would follow in the Davis
case other than to insure a fair and
impartial trial.
Whether a lawyer will be detailed
to defend Davis has not yet been de-
cided. The action of the mob which
attempted to take Davis, who is 28
years of age, from the fall of three
counties is thought to make his case
equally as grave as that of Lee.

Lea was arrested on October13,
charged with the murder of his bose,
a rich white landlord, and family.
Jones had been working for this land-
lord for 10 cents an hour, not getting
even his full pay. When Jones' boss

usual, they looked for a "nigger."
Lee who was known to have com-
mitted the "crime" of demanding his
pay from his boss, was charged with
the murder.

announced that Jones would plead

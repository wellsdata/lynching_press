Race So Depraved as to Deserve
Wells, the negro woman who is crusading
San Francisco, March 4.- Miss Ida
South, has no love for the Methodist ministers
of this city. At a meeting of Meth-
odist ministers today Miss Wells was discussed
, and while the reverend gentlemen
approved of her mission, they objected
to indorsing her, as she had not
proved that she was a member of a Meth-
odist church.
During the discussion Miss Wells came
into the room attempted to speak in
her own behalf and. She was not allowed
proceed, and was finally, with other
women, excluded from the room while
Bishop Goodsell related some thrilling
instances of negro depravity which he did
not consider proper for ladies to listen
. Miss Wells denounced her treatment
the ministers as shameful.

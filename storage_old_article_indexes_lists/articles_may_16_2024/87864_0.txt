Last night on a through freight
Deputy Sheriff W. C. Roebuck, of
Cleveland county, arrived here, and
the
in his custody were four of
negroes who are said to have been
implicated in the killing of T. T.
Johnson, at Kendail's mill last Sat
urday night, and for which crime
one negro was lynched near the
scene of the murder Monday night.
It was believed that the excited
people of Cleveland county would at
tempt to lynch the four negroes, so
Sheriff Dykes gave out the information
that they had been carried to
the jail at Camden for safe keeping,
when, in fact, he had them quietly
placed on a through freight train
bound for this place and brought
here and placed in the Jefferson coup
ty jail for safe keeping, where they
will remain until the convening of
the Cleveland county grand jury.
The sheriff's act is to be highly commended
for his prudence and
thought. fore

Women who go to lynchings should be sent back to the kit-
chen where they belong. In fact, the kitchen is too good for
them. Equal rights have gone too far when women construe
them as equal rights to shoot, torture and mangle. A news re-

father of the slain girl, in response

will be a lynching' at the Cannidy

"IT WAS MADE UP OF MEN,
WOMEN. CHILDREN AND BABIES
IN ARMS."
Yes, the women were there, and
they brought the children. Some
mothers held their youngsters high
so they could see all that happened.
in the manner of the woman in Regi-
nald Marsh's recent cartoon in the
New Yorker saying, "It's her first
lynching."
The children saw all the horror
and the violence, and the women took
part in it.
"All the white folks" were invited:
so nobody stayed at home. By the
time they got to Cannidy's nobody
knew whether the Negro had been
shot to death and mutilated after-
ward or had died in agony from his
wounds. So at Cannidy's the men,
and children went at it all

ccats; their hair showed signs of
having been nicely groomed before
It got rumpled in the crowd. They
were, in fact, housewives, school-
teachers, clerks, women known as re-
spectable in the community.
It happened twenty-five miles

individuals who have schools and

A newspaper friend who was rushed
to the scene said to me, "Don't ever
go to a lynching if you can avoid it.
You can't forget it: you wake up
nights and see it over and over. It
Isn't the lynched bodies that keep
you awake thinking; it's the crowd,
lusting for blood. And worst of all
Is seeing the women there."
WOMEN SINK
TO MEN'S LEVEL
Suppose. when these lynch-bound
men of Marianna set out they had
shut the kitchen door on their wives,
commanding. "You stay there: where
I'm going is no place for you." And
suppose then the wives had opened
the coor, grabbed back their men,
and said, "You stay here, too. If it's
no place for me it's no place for
you."
And if the men got away and final-
ly came home again, their hands
bloody from the lynching. suppose
the wives had said. "All right, now;
you can stay out. No lynchers want-
ed_here!"
The women of Marianna and the
women of San Jose, enjoying their
equal rights to stab and shoot and
torture, and to remember it in horror
ever after, have only sunk to the level
of the lowest male.

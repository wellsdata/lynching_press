Relatives of Murdered Man Forms a
Mob and Would Have Lynched
Prisoners, But They Were
Taken to Louisville.
Lexington, Ky., October 15.- Earl Whit-
ney, the young man arrested here last
Saturday charged with the murder of
Merchant A. B. Chinn, and seriously
wounding his son, Asa, made a complete
confession here at 11:30 a. m., admitting
he and Claude O'Brien, his pal,
did the killing. Whitney made his confession
to the officers in the presence of
a stenographer who is transcribing it for
the police. He said O'Brien fired the shot
that killed Chinn and admitted that the
shot in his knee was inflicted by Asa
Chinn in the struggle that followed. He
told where the pistol was hidden. The
officers went to the place and found the
weapon. It was a weapon stolen from the
home of O. L. Slade, that same night.
O'Brien had the gun stolen from former
Gov. Mitchell Alford. Whitney broke
down under the questions of the officers.
Judge Parker of the circult court,
fearing a mob would be formed to lynch
them, took the precaution to prevent an
outbreak if any is threatened. The confession
has gotten out and there is considerable
excitement at this time.
The confession is long one, and is
said to be complete. a

Negro Charged With Assault Is
,
Swung From a Trestle.,
BODY IS PULVERIZED WITH BULLETS
Mrs. White, Victim of Ravisher, Was
Beaten Into Insensibility and Left
Bu Dying Condition.
As a result of the fearful assault on
Mrs. Joe White at Early, Ga., Thurs-
day afternoon afternoon Bud Rufus,
colored, was lynched Friday night be put
tween 11 and 12 o'clock by a determined
band of men.
The negro was swung from a high on
trestle about half a mile from Early
on the Rome and Decatur railroad.
The rope was tied around his neck and
was asked if he had anything to
say. Rufus replied:
" Nothing,' cept to tell you gentle
if
men goodby, and to ask that you tell
my folks farewell."
He made no reference to the crime and
and said nothing as to his guilt or in- 1901
nocence.
Rufus was then shoved from the"
the
bridge, but the rope proved too weak
and broke, the body plunging into the
ravine below. The crowd then began
firing upon the prostrate body, One
shot struck Rufus squarely in the center
of the forehead and plowed its way
through his brain. His chest was almost
in a pulp and one hand hung by
a tendon. There is no way of telling
how many shots were fired, but Rufus'
body was struck fully a hundred
times.
The remains were carried up the
embankment and laid near the railroad
track. On his breast was a placard
bearing this notice:
" This is a warning to both black
and white not to meddle or you
will suffer the same fate.
" WE ARE THE PEOPLE."
Friday morning the body was viewed
by hundreds of curious people who
traveled scores of miles in buggies,
wagons, horseback and walking to witness
the grewsome sight.
The full and awful details of the assault
on Mrs. White are as follows:
Mrs. White was picking cotton near
home Thursday afternoon when the
assault was made. The miscreant evidently
slipped up behind her and
dealt a fearful blow over the head
with the limb of a tree as large as a
man's leg.
He then dragged her unconscious
form to the river bank and seized another
large stick and beat the woman
about the head and body until he
thought life extinct. Mrs. White was
then flung into a canebreak on the
river bank. The stick he tried to
throw into the water, but it was found
next day in some vines. It was clotted
with blood.
When Mrs. White failed to return
at dusk the search began. It was over
an hour before she was found, and
then by a low gurgling groan coming
from the canes.
Her skull was crushed in, jawbones
broken and face and head cut and
beaten almost beyond recognition. She
never gained full conscousness, but lay
in a stupor.
Bud Rufus, who was suspected of
perpetrating the crime was arrested on
the place of Mr. Appleton, near
Early, and carried before the dying
woman. She could not speak, but
when asked if the negro was her assailant
, nodded her head. The negro was
then given a hearing before' Squire
Early and remanded to jail.
The officers hoped to get him into
Rome, twelve miles distant, on a local
freight train which passed that point
at 6:25 o'clock, but an armed cordon
of men stood grimly about the train
and the effort was abandoned.
Bailiff Poole then carried the prisoner
to an old out of the way house,
thinking to thus throw the crowd off
the track and spirit the negro to some
jail.
The hope was futile, for about 10
o'clock the lynchers broke into the
house and overpowered the bailiff.
Rufus was carried to trestle and
met death as described the.

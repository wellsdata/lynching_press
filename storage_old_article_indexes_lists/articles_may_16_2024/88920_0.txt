From President Moffett, of the Mon-
tana and Wyoming Telephone company,
who is now making a tour of inspection
, comes the news of the lynching
and of an appeal for help from Sheriff
Fenton, of Big Horn county, who has
arrested a number of prominent cattle
men near Thermopolis, and has appealed
to the Governor of Wyoming for
the assistance of the militia in
his prisoners to Basin. getting
It was reported to Sheriff Fenton last
Wednesday morning that a mob was
coming up to Basin for the purpose of
lynching Gorman and Walters. As a
measure of precaution the sheriff took
these men and a horse thief out of the
jail and secreted them in a gulley near
under guard of Deputy Sheriffs
Felix town Alston and C. E. Pierce.

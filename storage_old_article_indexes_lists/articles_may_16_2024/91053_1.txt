Springfield, Ohio, March 9.- At 2:30
o'clock this morning the fire had burned
itself out and both mob and spectators
have for the most part dispersed.
Quiet prevails throughout the city and
the mob is good- natured and orderly.
evidently well satisfied with its night's
work. It is hardly probable that an attempt
will be made by the whites to
burn the West Washington street re-
rorts out as this section is closely
guarded by Dayton and Miamisburg
troops Probably twenty small bulld-
ings were. destroyed by fire.

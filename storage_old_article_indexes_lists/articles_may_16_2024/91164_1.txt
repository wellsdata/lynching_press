NEGROES TOLD TO ARM- WILSON
DENOUNCED BY
SPEAKERS CHICAGO.
Chicago, July 4 .-" Arm yourselves
now with guns and pistols," said Fer
dinand L. Barnett, a former assistant
state's attorney in speaking to 100
Negro men at a mass meeting held
this afternoon to protest against the
riots and blodshed in East St. Louis.
" Don't buy an arsenal, but get enough
guns to protect yourselves. You may
be victims in Chicago within a fortnight
of such murders and outrages
as have taken place in East St. Louis.
And when trouble starts let us not

public officials" laxness of duty" because
the riots took place, and demanding
punishment of the participants

court- martialed and branded a traitor
and murderer. I don't know who is
to blame, but a mob is a mob, and
ought to be dispersed or killed.
We are going to rectify this in some
way. The 10,000,000 of our race will
not stand for massacre.
" Behind an army go the guerillas-
looters, cowards and thieves. Behind
this riot is the public defense council,
whose fulminations are written with
out consulting a single Negro. They
breathe the same spirit as the mob of
East St. Louis did.
" Get guns and put them in your
homes. Protect yourselves. And let
no black man permit a policeman to
come in and get those guns."
" I love my race better than my coun
hoped God would demand 100,000
white lives in the war for each Negro
slaughtered in East St. Louis."
' I love my race better than my country
!" he shouted." This country,
under Woodrow Wilson, is asking us
cary the flag of democracy to

IMPORTANT DECISION IN REGARD TO THE
SHERIFF'S POWERS What are Lawful and what
Legal Means.- Judge Lowrie, in the District Court
at Pittsburgh, has given a decision that where,

sheriff hires, at great expense, armed military companies
to aid him, he cannot claim to be repaid by
the county for such expenses. The sheriff hired
several volunteer companies to protect the rolling-
mills, which were threatened with destruction by
a mob. The Court drew a distinction between
lawful and legal maans, which the sheriff is authorized
under to adopt, when a riot is threatened.
To say that the sheriff was bound to use all lawful
means to prevent the threatened destruction of
property, is to say that he must use all the means
that are not unlawful; and this would include all

adapted to the occasion, whether pointed out by the
law or not; means which are not properly official,
and which cannot reasonably exacted of public

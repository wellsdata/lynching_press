To Prevent Mob Violence.
Frankfort, Ky., June 26.- The governor
of Kentucky is determined to
prevent mob violence in this state.
While every one knows that the soldier
boys are going to Simpson county
to protect George Dinning, the negro
who is to be tried there next week,
none suspected that cannon would be
necessary to prevent mob violence,
but Acting Governor Worthington
thought otherwise, and two cannon
were loaded flat cars here to be
shipped to Franklin on.

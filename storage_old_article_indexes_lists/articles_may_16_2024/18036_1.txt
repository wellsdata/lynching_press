DIED FOR HIS FRIEND.
Eday Martin Lynched Because He Would
Not Peach on Bill Goods.
PRINCETON, Ky., Nov. 1.- News has
reached here of the lynching of Eddy
Martin in Crittenden county, yester
day morning, by a mob variously estimated
at from fifty to 100 men. The
scene of the lynching is in a remote
part of the county, and the details
are hard to get. The best obtainable
nformation is that Martin was called
upon at his home after midnight and
asked to get up and help put out a
fire that was raging in the neighbor-
hood. Opening the door he was
seized by a dozen or more men who
asked for information of Bill Goode.
the lawless paupr commissioner of
Crittenden county. He was also asked
about the latter's crimes, especially
that of horse stealing. The mob told
him they had come to hang him, but
if he turn state's evidence upon
Bill Goode would he would be spared.

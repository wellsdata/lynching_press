LYNCH LAW IN MARYLAND. A NEGRO
MURDERER HUNG.- On Thursday last, in Den-
ton, Caroline County, Md., a negro man named
Dave Thomas was tried for the murder of Wm.
11. Butler. Being only convicted of man
slaughter, and sentenced to 16 years and 7
months imprisonment in the penitentiary, the
friends and neighbors of the murdered man became
highly indignant, and there were strong
demonstrations of disapprobation manifested on
the Court House Green, where a large and excited
crowd had assembled, and serious threats
were made to force open the jail, take the negro
out and lynch him. The excitement was
very great so much so that the Court author-
,
ized the sheriff to summon a posse sufficient
to quell any disturbance that migh: occur.
W Tire excitement at the time, passed off; but
on Saturday night, it appears, dire threats wore
rendered by an incensed mob of some 60 or 70
men, who subsequently forced the jail, notwithstanding
the efforts of the sheriff and his
deputies, and after securing the negro, placed
a rope around his neck, and hung him up to
the nearest tree until life became totally ex-
tinet. The crowd then dispersed, having
carried
out the sentence of Judge Lynch to
deadliest extent .-- Boston Argus. its

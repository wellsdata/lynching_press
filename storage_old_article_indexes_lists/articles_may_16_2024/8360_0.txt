VICKSBURG, Miss., July 6.- Smith Tooley
and John 1. Adams, allas Totch, were hanged
about 12.20 o'clock this morning in the courthouse
yard by a mob of fully 700 white citizens
.
The Warren Light Artillery declined to defend
the jail and the crowd had no resistance
. Tooley was found alone in his cell and
was knocked down and taken out into the
street in front of the jail where
, he was
cross- questioned. Meantime. Adams
was
brought out.
Henry Blake, brother of the murdered man,
pleaded with the avengers, but in vain.
Tooley was taken over to the court- house,
and finally to the court in which
- room, were
500 people. Here the examination was resumed
. Both prisoners were cool..
The people finally grew weary of the fruitless
examination and a rush was made down
stairs with the prisoners. Both were then
hanged.
Their crime was the murder of Benson
Blake, a planter and merchant, at Redwood,
last Thursday, the culmination of thirteen
robberies and assassinations within the past
twelve months.

hundred or one thousand law abiding
citizens were lynched, mobbed or burnt
at the stake each week. But the President
and his Attorney- General are very
much concerned about the fate of the
Italians, who unjustly met their deaths
and intend to do everything in their
power to rectify that wrong. But his
actions rspecting the treatment of
those who commit such crimes against
the citizens of the United States are
entirely different, and his attitude in
that direction gives them license to
continue to do so. In the meantime
mob and lynch law is on the increase,
and the President contents himself by
saying that" lynchings must not be
tolerated in a great and civilized country
like the United States," and he
expects that the mere repetition of his
chosen words will stop its onward
march But we don't, neither does any
sane man..

LEE, Mont., June 3 .-- The latest advices
from the scene of the Cheyenne
Indian trouble are to the effect that
Standing Elk has confessed complicity
in the murder of John Hoover, the
herdsman, implicating Philip Stanley,
Sam Crow and Chief Red Bird. Captain
Stouch, the Indian agent, will
surrender the prisoners to Sheriff Gibb
Friday, but it is not likely they will
ever reach Miles City, the settlers
seem determined to lynch as them.

WALHALLA, S. C., Oct. 21.—
J. Laudy Harris (white), Wal-
halla mill employee, went about)
his business with a "clear con-
science" this week, the con-
fessed leader of a mob that
lynched Allen Green, a mem-
ber of the Race, but an inno-
cent man in the eyes of the
law.
Solicitor Leon W. Harris of An-
derson said he thinks the "case is
ended" as Harris has been acquitted
on six charges, including that of
murder, when tried with a score of
other Oconee county citizens for the
death of Green, who was slain by a
nob in April, 1930.
Makes Confession -
Laudy Harris, accompanied by a
minister, went to Sheriff John
Thomas Sunday and confessed he
was one of the leaders of the mob
of 100, which took Green from the
Oconee county jail, hanged him to a
tree three miles from town and rid-
dled his body with bullets. He re-
turned to the sheriff a pistol that
ħad been snatched from the officer's
hand while he was attempting to
protect his prisoner.
"I have not had an opportunity to
ge into the case," Solicitor Harris
said, “as I have just returned from
the funeral of a relative, but it is my
opinion that there wouldn't be a
chance of reopening the case.
"Harris and a number of others
were tried and acquitted on an in-
dictment containing six counts,
among them murder, accessory be-
fore and after the fact and con-
spiracy. These counts cover prac-
tically every charge upon which the
case might be re-opened.
"Although I plan to investigatej
Harris statements very closely, it
is my opinion that this is just one
of those unfortunate things that
sometimes happen in criminal law."
Harris told Sheriff Thomas in his
confession that he wanted to "make
peace with you and my Lord."
The mill employee, boss in a weave
room, refused to name any others
who took part in the lynching.

WIFE- MURDERER LYNCHED.
Officials and Citizens Taken Wholly by
Surprise.
LA PLATA, MD., June 27.- Joseph Cocking
, who was awaiting trial here for the
murder of his wife and sister- in- law, was
taken from jail at an early hour this morning
and hanged. The mob of executioners
had been quickly organized, and the authorities
were taken wholly by surprise.
The citizens of the town had no intimation
of the affair, and did not suspect anything
wrong until sunrise, when they
found the body the wretched man hanging
lifeless from of the limb of a tree.

Eight white men have been
sentanced to imprisonment for life
at Austin' Tex., for lynching
James Humphries, and two sons
over a year ago, The Humphries
were respectable white men and
were lynched by their neighbors
on the charge that they had
stolen a hog from a farmer. It
was not clearly established that
the victims stole the hog, but assuming
that they did it was a
ridiculous pretes for lynching and
the eight lynchers richly deserve
their punishment. It is a gratifying
sign that a white man has
been punished for lynching in the
South, but the gratification is
somewhat dampened by the fact
that the victims were white also.
Had the latter been black the
eight men who hanged them
would probably have escaped
punishmen. There is no case on
record yet in that section where a
white man has been punished for
lynching a Negro, though many
Negroes have been lynched for
causes as insignsficant as that
which led to the death of
Humphries. the
The Tribune expresses our views,
and we certainly congratulate the Tribune
for their timely editorial. In recent
years the white southern barbarians
have been trying to suppress
the associated press from[ sending reports
of the lynching to the northern
press and when such a strong article in
our behalf is seen on the Editorial page
of one of the greatest Dailies in the
it proves to us that" The Forum
West of the People" has not forsaken us.

Protest 'Legal
Lynch' Trial

Defender Staff Correspondent)
LAUREL, Miss.-Representatives
of two civil liberties groups have
started legal machinery rolling to
prevent the "legal lynching" of a
B0-year-old Laurel Negro on Jan. 7.
Intended victim of Mississippi
Justice is Willie McGee, who was
sentenced to death on a charge of
rape by an all-white Circuit court
jury here on Dec. 6. Several of
the jurors were picked from the
#treets of Laurel at random after
the panel had been exhausted for
#electeees.
It was alleged that McGee broke
into the home of a white woman
here early in the morning and at-
tacked her while a child who was
lightly ill occupied the same bed
and her husband slept in another
room of the house.
Whites Question Charge
Many Laurel whites question the
attack charge placed against Mc-
Gee. Investigations
have been conducted by
Bumham of the Southern
Youth Congress and this corres-
pondent, representing the regional
NAACP. After conferring on
findings, both groups advised that a
fight be waged against the convic-
ton.

The alleged attack is said to
have taken place on Nov. 2. A
truck which McGee had been driv-
ing was said to have been parked in
front of a residence just 150 feet
from the house in which the rape
Ar supposed to have taken place.
Arrested in Hattiesburg on Nov.
3. McGee was removed to the
Hinds county jail for safekeeping.
He was returned to Laurel on Dec.
3 for arraignment with 50 Mis-
rissippi State Guardsmen in at-
tendance during the entire trip to
offset possible mob violence.
Sanity Test Denied
The militiamen were also pres-
ent at the Dec. 6 trial when McGee,
trembling and evidently mentally
unbalanced by the ordeal, refused
to testify. As the accused -gazed
creamily into space, court-appoint-
ed defense counsel insisted
that
Judze F. Burkitt Collins call in
competent physicians to give the
defendant a sanity test. The court
refused this request but called sev
eral unqualified.. persons to pass
upon McGee's sanity. They readily
declared him sane and the trial
proceeded "according to sched-
tie.‚Äù
Visitors, including a Negro at-
forney, were denied the right to see
or talk with the defendant in the
Hinds county jail before the case
went to trial.

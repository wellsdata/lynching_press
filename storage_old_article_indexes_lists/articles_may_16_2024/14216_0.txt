LYNCH LAW- HIGH HANDED MEASURE.
A terrible outrage took place in Culpepper,
in this state on Wednesday last. A mob of
200 men, including justices of the peace,
members of the church, and others, proceeded
to the jail resisted the sheriff, and
carried off William Grayson, a free negro.
They dragged him to the woods, where they
hung him. The cause of this high handed
measure is this -- Grayson had twice been
convicted of murdering David A. Miller, a
white man, but each time he appealed, and
the General court granted him new trials, on
the ground that the testimony hardly justified
suspicion, much less guilt. The mob
allowed him one minute to confess. He
firmly avowed his innocence of the murder.
The mob then placed a fence rail across between
two trees, and strung him up. The
outrage has created intense excitement.-
The papers entreat the Governor to arrest
every one concerned in it[ Fredericksburg

The Shedder of Blood Dies Ere
Light Trembles on His Victim.
Albany, Ga., June 1.- A special

Arthur Thompson, a negro, shot
and killed M. I. Dudley, a young
white man early this evening.
A crowd of determined men caught
the negro, lynched him and riddled
the body with bullets before daylight
.
The cause of the difficulty between
and the negro is not yet
Dudley known.

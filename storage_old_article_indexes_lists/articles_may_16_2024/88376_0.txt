Curry Robinson and John Henry,
colored, of Hawkinsville, Ga., accused
of the murder of Mr. and Mrs.
Warren White, were put to death by
the usual mob, viz., lynchers, and
after being hanged were soaked with
oil an set afire. One revived, and
his screams were frightful. The
way they do in the Sunny South(.)

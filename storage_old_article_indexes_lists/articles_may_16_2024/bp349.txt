WHY AND HOW LYNCHING BEGAN AND HOW LYNCHING BEGAN
In the days of slavery there were
no lynchings because Negroes were «
held as chattel and the mere suspicion
of "rape" against them would have
i resulted in their being whipped to
#k
death or sold into Georgia, which, to
meant punishment

than
death.
In fact, slaves
were often the sole
protection of the
women folk, while
the masters were
away fighting to
ceep them in
bondage. The slave
regarded this con-
(ldence of the mas-
ser as a sacred
and
and proved
rust
faithful, many
times at the sacri-
worse
fice of his own life. But when the
master's own folly had robbed him of
tite ownership of body and soul and
reduced him to the level of a poverty
stricken mendicant, there sprang up a
new relationship between master and
servant which could not be reconciled
with two and a half centuries of un-
restricted enjoyment of the fruits of
slave labor.
Disappointed Heroes
This destructive economic and so-
cial revolution, decreed by fate, result-
ed in the flaming hate with which the
disappointed heroes of a lost cause be-
gan their systematic extermination
of Negroes of the South. But there
must be a pretext for the conflagra-
tion which was to light the Southern
skies at dead of night, as these invad-
ers of the moral decency of Christen-
dom went forth to the "Slaughter of
the Innocents".
Rape, the most despicable epithet
in the roster of crime, was applied to
the charge lodged against them to en-
list the sympathies of others, but it
had the reverse effect. Their crimes
aroused the moral indignation of the
people north and south, as well as the
peoples in countries which knew not
God, nor the white man's hate of his
brothers in blood. These midnight
assassins knew, as all the world has
since learned, that 95 percent of their
victims were "framed", but the strong
arm of the Federal Government re-
mained paralyzed and nothing was
done about it..
Treated Like Humans
Although the "Sword of Damocles"
hung by à slender thread, its fall was
destined to usher in a reign of terror
in which the destiny of the Negroes
of the South was to be written in let-.
ters of blood. The reasons for this
delay were: the Republican. Party's
control of the South and the presence
of U. S. troops, who were there to see
that the enforcement of Federal laws
were not obstructed by the doctrine of
"State's Rights". Under this protec- }
tion, Negroes enjoyed their first ex-
perience of what it was like to be hu-
man beings endowed with attributes
common to other humans. As states-
men, they helped to make the laws of
Reconstruction; and as soldiers they
helped to preserve and enforce them!
But under the conditions of the com-
promise of the election of 1876, under
which the Republican Party of the
South was "sold out" and the Federal
troops withdrawn, the Negro of the "
South was left to fight alone with hig
back to the wall. The stage was now
set for the mass murders long coll-
templated. "Night Riders" and the
KKK sprang up overnight and, with
shot-guns, firebrands
blood-
hounds, began the crlines which
transcended in Iniquity the darkest
ages of world history and which have
continued throughout the past 67
years under a democratic governnient
in a Christian land.
and
North Derelict
Congressman Dyer tried for years
to do something about it, but the Sol-
id South has always been able to
muster enough northern votes to de-
feat these efforts. For the present,
at least, the southern men seem to
realize that 8 to 10 crimes of the
same nature in as many states over™
a long period of years might tend to
raise a question too delicate to dis-
cuss and so they have switched from
the charge of rape and begun to lynch
Negroes for talking back to white
men or shooting them in self-defense.
We agree that rape is a loathesome
crime, but what we can't understand
is why it is so loathesome when com-
mitted by a Negro and passes almost
unnoticed when committed by a white
man upon a Negro woman. These
lynchings of Negroes for alleged rape
recalls to mind that if all the actual
rapes committed by white men upon
Negro women resulted in lynchings,
their funerals would reach around the
world. There will always be Tal-
madges in Georgia, just as there will
always be Lovejoys, Beechers, Stowes,
Garrisons and John Browns in the
North.
But it is time for the Negro to do
some thinking about his own future
instead of leaving it for others to do;
All loyal citizens love their country.
They wish their country to be right,
but right or wrong their country still,
This, minus a few details, is a sketch
of the history of the crime of lynch-
ing.

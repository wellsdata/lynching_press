Speak Out Against Mob Law.
The Chattanoga Times of Thurs
day condemns- editorially the recent
lynching of Alfred Blount in that
city.
Doubts of the guilt of the victim
exist among the the people there
reported by the Times. as
Mob law is a menance to the safes
ty of the innocent and the public
peace and welfare. The law should
punish these crimes, and be supreme.
" The Times says;
Again Chattanooga has had an
experience of lynch law. The jail
has been violated, a prisoner taken
out and hanged by a mob who had,
could have in the nature of the case
and proceedings, no positive evidence
that they were wreaking yen
geance on a ravisher, or putting to
death an innocent man.
The wrong morals and wrong pol-
icy of such an act are not debatable
questions. The men of sense who
engaged in the lynching, when cool,
will admit that it was a frightened
wrong, in contemplation of law, ab
abstract right and the highest interest
of society.
We believe that one judicial hanging
of a rapist will do more to stop
the beastly crime than ten lynchings
We believe this on what we believe
are sound deductions from fact,
The arrest, incarceration, orderly
trial, considerable time between sen-
tence and execution, give the news
of the whole transaction time to percolate
through even the dull brains
of the two- legged brutes, whose te≈Ñ-
dencies lead them to gratifiy theired
lust at all hazards. In this the
way
lesson has a wider effect than can the
lynching of such a beast, which is
but a few hours' sensation, a few
days' topic, and then forgotten.
In a country of courts the safety
of society. as well as the protection
of innocent men accused, lies in the
regular enforcement of the law.
There is no question about this,
Those who, following their passions
and revengeful spirit, make an exception
to this general rule, admit
postulate that the lawful course
the is the only sate course, in all cases
We believe it is best in all cases.
We know that the community which
adheres to the law, excepting no
crime to the jurisdiction of Judge
Lynch, is not only the most prosper-
oust and desirable community, but
freest of
the most peaceable, crimes,
hence the happiest
great and petty,
,
We have a judge who can be implicitly
trusted to enforce the extreme
penalty of the law on such
offenders as it is charged the man
was, whom the mob hanged from the
bridge Tuesday night. That judge
would see that the right man was
punished; there would be no mistake
no chance of mistake. The murdering
of no man, in his jurisdiction, is
needed to insure the doing of justice,
Hence the violence in this case, pre
cedud by criminal destruction of
of inno
property and today an insult to
majesty of the law, but a defiance the of
and insult to the court,
Besides all this, the lynching is a
black eye for Chattanooga, a fearful
damage to our repute in quarters
bowhere we are peculiarly needing to
make and hold a reputation for
law and order. Viewed from any
standpoint, lynch law, in a community
like ours, is of bad effect, to say
nothing of the that every man engaged
in a lynching makes of himself
a murderer in the sight of God and
well regulated men, in the purview
of the law and contemplation of
morality.
If the courts do their duty- and
we believe they will- the end of
Tuesday night's business at the jail
and at the bridge is not yet; and the
end will be less pleasant, perhaps,
than was the strangling and riddling
with lead, of a helpless prisoner, the
absolute ascertainment of whose
has been made impossible by
guilt the lawle's destruction of his life.

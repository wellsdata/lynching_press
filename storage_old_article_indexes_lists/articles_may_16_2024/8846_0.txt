war with Spain., The city hall in Chi-
cago was last winter the scene of a
mob that threatened to lynch the aldermen
who had been bought up like
cattle by the street railroad lines of
that city. But this I believe was a
sham affair and the actors in it deserved
hanging as much as the aldermen
. So are the jungles of polities
in great deep cities. Honest country

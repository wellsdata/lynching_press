The Beginning of the Affray.
The circumstances leading up to the
affray are described in detail. According
to this account Charles Difata was
alone when Dr. Hodges passed. There
is no effort made in the report to obscure
the fact that Charles Difata
made the first offensive overture. But
it is contended that this was not accompanied
by the use of firearms or
even a movement to draw them. It is
said, however, that Charles Difata upbraided
Dr. Hodges in an offensive way
for having killed an animal and accompanied
this by a blow of the fist.
Then, it is stated, Dr. Hodges shot at
Difata. Whether or not the shot took
effect it was not possible for the Ital-
ian authorities to learn, as the bodies
of the men, after being lynched, were
disfigured and disposed of. But at all
events it is stated that Charles Difata
was on the ground following the shot
from Dr. Hodge's weapon. At this
point Joe Difata made his appearance
and seeing his brother down and a
second shot about to be fired, shot
Dr. Hodges. at

Edwardsville, Ind., June 15- A
chase of forty hours ended last night
when Gustav Markel, his eye shot out
and his head and hands torn by a hundred
leaden pellets, was landed in jall
here, after having been barely saved
from hanging by a mob. Markel shot
and killed Mrs. Josephine Hilla at Glen
Carbon Monday night and wounded
three other persons. Mrs. Hilla had
forbidden his attentions to her 16-
year- old daughter. Several hundred
armed men took part in the hunt for
him. He emptied two revolvers at his
pursuers before he was captured. Preparations
were being made to lynch
him when the officers came to his
cue. res-

IS GOOD WITNESS
DON'T LYNCH HIM
Mob Took Grant Sanders
From Officers and Then
Changed Their Minds
THE ROPE AND TREE
Had Already Been Selected- Was
Prisoner of Vital Archard, Who
Was Killed By Mob.
The fact that Grant Sanders,
negro, is a valuable witness for the
state is all that saved him from
lynching yesterday morning, when he
was returned to Farrell, Ark., by
Constable A. F. McNeill, of Redfield
and Deputy Constable Grover Re
more, of Farrell, from Dumas, De
sha county, where his arrest led directly
to the assassination of Con
stable Vital Archard, of Farrell, near
the Desha county seat early Sunday
morning by a mob of negroes, said
to have been led by W. S. Rhea,
white man. Had not Rhea been taken
from an Iron Mountain train here
while being carried to Little Rock for
safe keeping Monday he, too, would
have been taken from the train when
it passed through Farrell that after
and lynched.
noon Sanders had just been arrested on
Sanders went back to Arkansas City.
A mob at Dumas wanted to lynch
Sanders Monday night, but Constable
McNeill and Deputy Prosecuting Attorney
T. G. Parham, of this city, in
them to let the law take its
course duced.

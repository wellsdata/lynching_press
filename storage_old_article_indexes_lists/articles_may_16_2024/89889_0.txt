SHALL THE MOB OR THE
COURT EXECUTE LAWS?
" A Striking Coincidence"
Before passing sentence on 17 men
convicted in court at Dobson, the
other day, for partiicpation in the
lynch riot at Winston- Salem last fall,
Judge B. F. Long made a statement
of which the following is part:
" The question is whether the mob
shall execute the laws of North Caro-
lina, or whether the court will execute
the laws of North Carolina,
whether the mob shall be allowed to
try, convict and execute prisoners, or
the court. As I have stated before,
this particular mob tried and convicted
a man that the woman who was
assaulted said was innocent, and they
would have executed him all right if
they had been allowed to go on; hence
you see the recklessness of the mob
and the danger of the mob and the
necessity of suppressing mob violence
in North Carolina. It may be said
that the best thing to do is to impose
a mild sentence; I had an experience
once with a mob; the grand jury nor
the jury could find the man or men
who actually slew three Negroes. Men
broke into jail, took out the Negroe
and slew them while the court was in
session and I was presiding the
at
time, but it was done at night and
nobody could identify the men, but the
grand jury did discover the man who
led the mob into the jail and helped
break down the door and took out
the victims and delivered them to the
mob; and he was convicted and put
in the penitentiary for 15 years, under
my sentence, and there was not another
mob in North Carolina that ever
assembled or ever executed anybody
while that man remained in the penitentiary
; but within three months after
he was pardoned, there was another
mob assembled and executed a
man.
" I only mention this to show to any
man who has got a mind to think and
a soul to save and any respect whatever
for the laws of the land that the
court cannot afford to let this matter
pass without imposing adequate punishment
; otherwise, there will be another
mob assembled in Winston-
Salem or somewhere else in North
Carolina. I regret exceedingly that
the burden is put upon me to try this
case, and, indeed, to impose any sentence
whatever on these men, but I
can't help it."
It is a striking coincidence, at the
least, to which his honor refers. Cer-
tain it is that if at least one member
of the average mob guilty of violence
were put behind the bars for a sea-
more
son, there would not be any
lynch law in that particular vicinity
for a long while- except, indeed, under
the extremest provocation involving
feeling, if at all.- The Greenwood

WHITE SLAVERY IN MISSOURI. An exciting
slave case lately occurred at Palmyra, Mo.
A female slave of Mr. Pond was captured
on the ferry boat, uaking her way to Quin-
ey, Ill. She had be en kept at the house of
a Mr. Davis, a Germ. n, in Palmyra, for a
few days, and brought thence by Sheible,
another German, to the ferry boat opposite
Quincy. When she was taken back to Pal-
myra, both Germans and a free negro were
imprisoned. The Germans declared that
they had no suspicion that the woman was
a slave, and several gentlemen of Palmyra
testified that they had seen her at Davis'
house, and took her for a white woman. In
fact she was white, and her genealogy had
to be resorted to, to show that she had a
slight taint of negro blood. The German
who took her in his carriage to the boat was
acquitted, but compelled to leave the State,
being threatened with lynch law; and Davis
is held for further trial, and stands a fair
chance for five years in the penitentiary for
harboring a white woman. This is the in-
stitution Missouri proposes to force upon
Kansas, and this law under which Davis is
in danger of the pentitentiary, is one of the
code adopted for Kansas by the ruffian Legislature
and to be enforced by United States
muskets,.

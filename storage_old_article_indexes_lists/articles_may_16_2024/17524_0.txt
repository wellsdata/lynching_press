Lynching Extraordinary.- The Mil
wankee Sentinel gives an interesting
lynching case which occurred at Geneva,
in that State. Several young ladies have
been in the habit of bathing in a beauti-
cove formed by Geneva Lake, and
nearly concealed by dense shrubbery.
Ike S, a booby of 22, who lives with
farmer G. in the capacity of" help," informed
some of his mates that" curiosities
may be seen there, cheaper and better
than at the circus," and for his part,
he" would go to the show!" This being
reported to some of the fair ones, they re-
to give him a lesson. While some
of the more juvenile members of the group
made apparent preparations for the bath,
a committee of full- grown feminines
searched the thicket and found Ike.placed
very conveniently for peeping. To seize
and strip him was the work of a few moments
, and the hazel brushes which had
formed his hiding place, became rods of
in the hands of his captors. Serv-
justice ed him right.'

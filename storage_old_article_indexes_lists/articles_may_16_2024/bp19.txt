A SOUTH CAROLINA MOB lynched a woman recently, now
they are investigating the case to see if she was guilty or not. If
she was innocent, and she probably was, they simply made a mis-
take that's all and what are you going to do about it?
THERE IS ALWAYS TWO SIDES TO EVERY STORY,
a wise thing to do is to hear both sides then keep silent.
WE ARE NOT ASKING FOR A FISH just give us a hook.

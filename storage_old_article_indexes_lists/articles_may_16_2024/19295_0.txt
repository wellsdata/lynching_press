NEGRO MASONS UNDER A CLOUD.
Recent Murders in Mississippi Laid
at Their Door.
NEW ORLEANS, Sept. 25.- A Greenwood,
Miss., special to the Picayune says:" A
negro named Henry Taylor killed another
negro on the Tallahatchie river two months
ago. At the time an attempt was made by
colored Masons to lynch him, but they were
Mr. Stancil taking
prevented, a
Taylor into his house and protecting
him. Since then both Taylor
and his wife have disappeared. One day
last week a body was found in the river,
which proved to be that of Taylor, and the
impression is that the colored Masons made
away with both him and his wife. George
Evans, who was hanged here July 27 by a
negro mob, is supposed to have been lynched
by colored Masons because he had killed one
of their number. The feeling is getting to
be strong that the colored Masons take an
oath in their secret organization avenge
the death of a brother Mason." to

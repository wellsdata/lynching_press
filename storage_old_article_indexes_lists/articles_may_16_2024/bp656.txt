Federal Action Demand-
ed of Pres. Coolidge;
Two Women Lynched
18 LYNCHINGS 1925
as
New York, â€šNov. 12.-Asserting
that the lynching of 3 Negroes, one
of them a woman, near Houston
Texas, brought the total to date
for 1926 up to 31 lynching
against 18 for the entire year 1925,
the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People,
69 Fifth Avenuc, today telegraph-
ed President Coolidge urging a
statement from him to the country
on this subject and asking that he
urge Congress to take the appro-
priate action within its power to
end the lynching evil.
The lynching in Texas is the sec-
ond in which a woman has been
among the victims, the first such
fynching for the year having oc-
curred in Aiken, South Carolina,
where a mob on the morning of
October 8, lynched Bertha Low-
man, her brother and her cousin,
the brother having been ordered
acquitted by the Judge presiding at
their trial.
The status of the lynching states,
as reported by the National Asso-
clation for the Advancement of.
Colored People for the current year
is as follows: Florida 8; Texas 5;
Mississippi 4; South Carolina and
Arkansas 3 each; Tennessee 2; and
one in Georgia, Kentucky, Louis-
lana, Maine, New Mexico, and Vir-
ginia.
The text of the telegram to
President Coolidge is as follows:
"Within a month and 4 days of
the lynching of a colored woman
and two men in Aiken, South Caro-
lina, three Negroes, one of them a
woman, are reported murdered by
n mob in Texas. Press reports
state that the Negroes were wan-
tonly assassinated in revenge for
the killing of a white man with
whose death none of the murdered
Negroes was in any way connect-
ed. This last outrage increases
the number of recorded American
lynchings for the year to date to
thirty-one, as against eighteen for
the entire twelve months of 1925.
The National Association for the
| Advancement of Colored People,
again respectfully urges that you
make some statement to the coun-
try on this shameful situation and
call upon the Congress to tako
the appropriate action which lies
within its power.

The Lynchburg( Va.) News says
that although the lynching of Hen
,
ry Mason, colored, recently, for the
murder of Mrs. Hammersley is the
first occurrence of the kind in
Campbell county, the very name of
" lynch law" was derived from a native
of that county- old Col. Lynch
who was in the habit of administering
summary punishment to
marauders and of
miscreants every
description without paying any attention
to the ordinary processes of
law. Hence he was called" Judge
Lynch," and this, it is said is the
true origin of the terms"
and" lynch law." lynching

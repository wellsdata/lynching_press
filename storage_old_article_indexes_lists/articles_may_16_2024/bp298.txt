NEW YORK CITY â€”(WDL)
Immediately following announce-
ment of the brutal lynching of two
Negroes and their wives near Mon-
roc, Georgia, the Workers Defense
League joined the drive for com-
plete federal and state investiga-
tions and for immediate passage of
federal unti-lynch
legislation.
In answer to 8 WDL wire
pointing out that the Monroe
lynching was "doubtless encourag-
ed by the recent victory of Eugene
Talmadge," Governor Ellis Arnall
of Georgia, who has offered a $10,-
000 reward wired back: "Thanks
for your message. Am doing every-
thing humanly possible to appre-
hend and prosecute guilty parties."
In addition to wiring Governor
Arnall, requesting a complete state
investigation, the League wired
Turner Smith of the civil liberties
division of the U. S. department of
Justice urging that the probe an-
nounced by the attorney-general
be a complete one.
President Truman, was urged by
the WDL to deliver a special mes-
sage to congress calling for anti-
lynch legislation. Democratic and
Republican congressional leaders,
Sen. Joseph M. Guffey, who came
out in favor of such legislation and
Senator Robert M. La Follette, J..
were all urged by the League to get
the anti-lynch law out of commit-
tee before congress aajourns.
Then. following announcement of
another lynching, near Lexington,
Miss., the WDL asked President
Truman "To personally take a hand
in ending
this open season on
lynching" and renewed its request
that he deliver a special message
to congress demanding anti-lynch
legislation. This letter described
as "completely inadequate" the
President's expression of horror
made indirectly through the attor-
ney-general.WDL

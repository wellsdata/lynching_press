LYNCH LAW IN ALA-
For the third time Heywood Patter-
son, and for the second time Clarence
Norris are sentenced to die in the elec-
triç chair.
Both convicted contrary to the evi-
dence.
Ruby Bates' testimony that they are
innocent was disregarded.
Judge Horton's opinion, reversing the
last jury's verdict as contrary to the
evidence was disregarded.
Judge Horton was removed" and re-
placed by Judge Callahan.
This judge "forgot" to instruct the
jurors how to bring in a verdict if
they found the boys "not guilty", in-
structing them only how to word their
verdict of "guilty".
The State's Attorney admitted be-
fore the court that his plea to the
jury was "an appeal to passion." The
cour was turned into a forum from
which to appeal to the basest passions
of hatred and violence against black
men because they are black.
The Scottsboro boys stood between
such "Justice" and violent lynching.
Seven of the boys have a short re-
spite.
Their lives depend upon us.
We must take appeals to the Su-
preme Court of Alabama-and should
we fall there-to the Supreme Court
of the United States.
The printing alone for these briefs,
in the State Supreme Court will cost
$3,500, and they must be complète, and
ready within 30 days of December 7th,
In addition, $1,500 is immediately re-
quired for the court stenographers'.
fees and other fees connected with the
appeal.
Again we ask all those who feel out-
raged by injustice. lynching, and class
discrimmation to help us in this strug-
gia for clementary justice.
WILL YOU SEND US A CONTRI-
EUTION QUICKLY?
Do not fail these boys in this critical
moment.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM L. PATTERSON L. PATTERSON

The State Disgraced.
[ Richmond Telegram.]
There really seems to be not any justification
for the lynching. The criminal was under arrest
and there was no occasion to doubt that
full justice under the law would be meted out
to him. This section of the state has been disgraced
by a number of lynchings since the war,
and whitecapping was for a long time a favorite
pastime. The lynching of Turley seems to
have
whetted the appetite of the mob for
blood, and the morning papers tell of preparations
being made for another hanging bee at
Brownstown. The action of the lawless element
brought reproach on the good name of
Indiana and some action should be taken by
the state, authorities to stop these outrages.

ARKANSAS MOB HANGS NEGRO.
Colored Man Who Attacked White
Landlord is Lynched.
Brinkley, Ark., June 26.- Clarendon,
a town sixteen miles south of this city,
was the scene of a lynching yesterday.
Jack
Harris, a negro, was hanged
to the rafters of the porch to the Amer-
ican Cotton company's office by about
fifteen masked men. No disturbance
was created. Last Sunday night
the
negro viciously assaulted his landlord,
John Coburn, a white planter, living
eight miles east of Clarendon, break-
jing one of his arms and inflicting numerous
other wounds about his body with
a beam of wood having a spike driven
thru it. Coburn's wife appeared with a
gun and Harris fled. Coburn had rebuked
the negro for using a mule without
permission. Harris was captured
the next day and taken to Clarendon.
Sheriff Milwee hid Harris outside the
jail. When the demand was made on
him for the keys he took the mob thru
the jail, but Harris was found in
jail and hanged. the

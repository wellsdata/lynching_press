December 3, 1919.
Hon. Hugh M. Dorsey,
State Capitol,
Atlanta, Georgia.
The seventy- fourth lynching in
America since January first and the
twentieth in Georgia occured near
Macon, Georgia, according to press
dispatches, on Sunday night a Negro
was put to death for wounding a
sign-
farmer who will recover.
As a
er of the Address to the Nation appealing
to loyal Americans to stamp
out mob violence and disregard of
all law and order and as one who
has shown himself to be against
lynching, may we not appeal to you
to use your official and personal
powers to investigate this lynching
and show lynchers that they cannot
American citizens with im-
murder punity.

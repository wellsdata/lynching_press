MOB LYNCHES NEGRO.
Victim Had Made His Way Into House
With Evil Intentions.
Marque, Tex., December 26.- Anderson
Calloway, a negro youth, was taken from
the county jail here last night by unknown
persons and hanged to a nearby
tree. Early Christmas morning the negro
forced an entrance into the residence
of W. J. Dean, a farmer, living two
miles out of town, and made his way to
the room usually occupied by Miss Buch-
anan, a granddaughter of Dean, but on
this night occupied by a neighbor's son.
The negro's movements awakened the
boy, who recognized him. The negro
fled, but was later arrested. No guard
was placed at the jail building, as there
was no evidence of violence. Last night
he was taken from the prison and after
making a full confession of his intentions
, was hanged a nearby tree. The
body is till hanging to there tonight.

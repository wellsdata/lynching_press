LYNCHINGS.
A proment Federal official in
Georgia has been collecting the
lynching statistics for a group of
four Southern States, including
Georgia, Alabama, Florida and
South Carolina, and finds that
there were in these States fifty-
three criminal assaults on white
women last year, distributed as
follows: Georgia 21, South Caro-
lina 14, Alabama 15, and Florida
3. The assailants in all cases save
two were negroes. Of these criminals
34 were promptly lynched,
1 hung by law, while the fate of
20 was never definitely known, 15
being" lost in the woods," that is,
probably lynched or" disposed of,"
making a total of 49 lynched, 1
judicially hung, and the remainder
escaping. It is probable that
if any of the latter had been
caught, lynching would have
promptly followed.
It appears from these figures
that public sentiment in the four
States we have mentioned is, as
Bishop Hugh Miller Thompson
declares, very emphatically in favor
of lynching for this crime,
and it would appear also that
Judge Lynch is vigilant and very
few of these crimes by negroes go No
unpunished; and finally that the
crime is one largely peculiar to 37
the negro. All these circumst-
andes will tend to prevent any
change of public sentiment in the
rural districts of the South in the
$
matter of lynching for certain
crimes.- Times- Democrat.
A special despatch to The Times-
Democrat from Baton Rouge Bays:
Mr. Loret is desirous of adding to
the extent of St. Mary parish, and
to that end has introduced a bill
changing the boundary lines of
that parish, together with those of
St. Mattin and Iberia. The object
of the bill is to add to St. Mary a
certain strip of swamp land which
is included in the parish of St.
Martin, but cut off entirely from
that parish by the intervention of
Iberia. The value of the land is
not considerable, but it is occupied
by many swampers and others,
who claim that their affairs would
be benefited and their efforts facilitated
by annexation to St. Mary."
The strip of land refered in the
above should belong to either
Iberia or St. Mary, we believe
however St. Mary should have
better claim for annexation. It is
the famous' Bayou Boutte' section
where a little war occured a few
years ago that cost this parish
several thousand dollars for the
prosecution of those who were accused
of having taken part in the
' war' in which several persons
were killed. This parish is anxious
to cede that part of our parish
, which properly belong to O.
either Ibers or St. Mary.

LYNCHED AN INNOCENT MAN.
But the North Dakota Mob Made No
Distinction.
Grand Forks, N. D., Nov. 22 .-" An
innocent man was hanged by lynch-
ers at Williamsport," Chief Justice
Corliss of the state supreme court
said yesterday." I have ample documentary
proof of this.
" The supreme court ordered a new
trial in Coudot's case, because it appeared
that he was convicted on the
uncorroborated evidence of Holytrack
and Ireland, both of whom confessed
to taking part in the murder of the
Spicer family. Their statements as to
Coudot were refuted by the testimony
of Dr. Ross the resident phy-
, agency
Ross'
sician at Standing Rock. Dr.
veracity is unquestioned, and his testimony
is supported by notes from his
memorandum book. Another fact is
that Holytrack and Ireland made two
previous confessions, in neither of
which did they implicate Coudot.
" Holytrack and Ireland explated
their crime on the gallows, as there
was no question of their guilt, but the
mob made no distinction, and hanged
the innocent with the guilty. The
lynching is a foul crime and a blot on
the name of the state and his murderers
fair should not go unpunished."

NEW YORK, AUGUST 16.- Many fights
resulted tonight. Alexander Robinson, a
negro and colored friend were on a 34th
street car. Some one sets up a shout
as the car neared 8th avenue that the
negro ought to be lynched. A man with
a clothes line appeared and the two' ne
groes were pulled off the car. The rope
was thrown around Robinson's neck and,
with fifty men and boys pulling, the mob
started for a lamp post. A squad of police
appeared before the mob had gone
and with much clubbin gdispersed
far the crowd. The two negroes got away.

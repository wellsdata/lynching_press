LYNOH LAW.- This summary way of dispensing
justice seems to be getting too much
in vogue. Our Smith county correspondent
gives a detailed account of the hanging of a
negro for murder in that section; and we find
in the Memphis Eagle and Enquirer of the
26th, an account of a similar lawless act perpetrated
in La Grange upon a negro boy who
had killed his overseer. The provocation was
great in both instances, but sober second
condemns the extreme punishment in-
thought flicted by a mob.

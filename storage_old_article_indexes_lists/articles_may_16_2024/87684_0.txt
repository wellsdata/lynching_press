From the Richmond Democrat.
for Rev. Xenophen Ryland, of Lexington,
occupied the pulpit at the Presbyterian
church last Sunday night, and it may
that a portion of his sermon made some
of his hearers wince. As to that we
a
presume no one knows. Ryland is a
inan who has made a success in more
is than one walk of life. As a jurist, as a
judge, as a politician he has made his
her mark and is now rounding out the last
. decade, a devoted servant of God in the
ministry. Whether or not he has been
ordained as a minister, we cannot say,
. but certain it is that his
sermons are full
, of logic and convincing thoughts.
. Above all, Ryland says what he thinks
and is fearless in such utterances. Last
Sunday he referred with touching fervor
to the death of the Savior upon the
cross and branded those who did it as
- murderers. Closely following he start-
sumed the
congregation by referring to the
death of Jesse Winner and James Nel-
in son at the hands of the mob and pro-
- nounced the men who did the deed,
whether they numbered one or one
thousand, as murderers.
at Xenophen Ryland did not add to his
popularity by uttering such words, but
We give him credit for considerable
backbone in talking as he did in Rich-
- mond.

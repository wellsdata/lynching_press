Put Out of the Way and Now the
Mob Wants to Clean Up the Whole
Criminal Docket.
Butte, Mont., July 19.- A Miner special
from Redlands, Ment., says: From
President Moffett of the Montana&
Wyoming Telephone company now
making a tour of inspection of his
company's lines, comes news of a
lynching at Basin, Wyo., early this
morning, and an appeal for help from
Sheriff Fenton of Big Horn county, who
has arrested a number of prominent
cattlemen near Thermopolis. He has
appealed to the governor of Wyoming
for assistance in getting the prisoners
to the Basin jail. The lynching this
morning resulted in the killing of two
condemned murderers and Deputy
Sheriff C. E. Pierce.
The murderers were Jim Gorman, who
killed his brother about a year ago and
ran off with the brother's wife, and a
man named Walters, who killed a
widow named Hoover at Thermopolis
Hot Springs two years ago because she
refused to marry him. It was reported
to Sheriff Fenton on Wednesday that a
mob was coming to the Basin for the
purpose of lynching Gorman and Wal-
ters. The sheriff took
the two men
and a horse thief out of the jail and
secreted them in a gulley near the
Gorman
town under guard. managed
escape. He swam
to the Big Horn
river, an unprecedented feat, and made
for the mountains. A posse recaptured
him yesterday morning fifty miles
from Basin. Last evening a mob of
about thirty unmasked men proceeded
to the county jail and fired a volley
into the jail. Deputy Pierce and Special
Deputy Meade were guarding the
prisoners at the time. One bullet
grazed Meade's shoulder and entered
Pierce's heart, killing him instantly
The mob procured telephone poles and
battered the jail doors down, and at
once riddled Walters and Gorman with
bullets and lead.
About six weeks ago as the result
of a range feud in the vicinity of
Thermopolls a sheepman, Ben Min-
nick, was killed by cattlemen. Sheriff
Fenton, it is claimed, has captured the
murderers, all prominent cattlemen,
and their names are wthheld on account
of threats. It is claimed that the
same mob that lynched Gorman and
Walters have declared that the sheriff
shall never get out of the locality alive
with his prisoners. The sheriff has
wired the governor of Wyoming to use
the state militia at Lander, and he has
also sent telephone messages to Cody,
Basin and other Wyoming towns asking
volunteers to assist in
the law. upholding

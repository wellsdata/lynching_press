There has been another lynching of a
suspected murderer in the Palouse section
of Washington. A few years ago
there was such a crime committed and
it was boasted that it was done" to save
the county expense." The Palouse is
covering itself with ignominy in permitting
these crimes. Something is wrong
in a community where such things are
possible. There are sometimes extenuating
circumstances. If a criminal is
caught red- handed in the commission of
some atrocious deed, condemnation of a
mob lynching him is necessarily modified
by the circumstances of the case.
But there is no possible excuse when a
man who is merely suspected is
out and killed.- Idaho Statesman. taken

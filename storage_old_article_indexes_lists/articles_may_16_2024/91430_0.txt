YOUNG NEGRO TAKEN FROM
JAIL BY MOB AND LYNCHED
Laurens, S. C., Aug. 12.- Protesting
his innocence to the last, Richard
Puckett, a young negro boy charged
with attacking a young white woman
of the community, was taken from the
jail here early today and lynched. His
swinging body afterward was perforated
with bullets from the revolvers of
more than 2,000 men who composed the
mob.
The sheriff declared Puckett had
confessed his crime. The negro, just
before he was lynched, protested his
innocence. The mob overpowered the
sheriff and his deputies, breaking down
the jail door and tearing to pieces a
cage in which Puckett was con-
steel fined.

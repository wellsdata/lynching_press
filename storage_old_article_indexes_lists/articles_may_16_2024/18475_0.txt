ST. LOUIS, Dec. 30.- For several
weeks past a big burly negro has been
stealing all sorts of things from the
Union Market house, but has always
escaped arrest and the tenants of the
market became exasperated over their
losses. This morning the negro was
caught while carrying off two horse
blankets and the cry of" lynch him"
went up. A crowd of angry men seized
him, bound his wrists, put a rope
around his neck and strung him up by
a block and tackle, hanging in the market
house. But the negro was a fellow
of great nerve and while his tongue
was protruding from his mouth and his
eyes bulging from their sockets he
made a violent struggle, broke the
cord which bound his arms, and be
fore the mob realized what he was doing
he whipped out a big knife from his
pocket, cut the rope around his neck,
dropped to the ground and ran like a
deer. He was overtaken, but he
turned with his big knife and the crowd
wavered, the negro a chance
to dodge into giving an alley and escape.

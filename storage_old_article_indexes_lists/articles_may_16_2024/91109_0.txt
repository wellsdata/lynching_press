MOB RULE END HOW TO
Governor Noel of Mississippi
has challenged public attention
and admiration by his denuncia-
tion of mob law and his announce.
ment of a determination to use the
military forces of the state if
necessary to put an end to mob
law. After two lynching parties
had recured their victims, Governor
Noel issued this statement:
I am sorry to say it, but the
time has come in Mississippi
when there will have to be an
armed clash between the military
and the citizens. For the
good of the state, conditions cannot
be allowed to continue as they
are, for it will simply resolve itself
into a contest of strength between
the mob and the powers of
the state.
When there was danger of a
lynching at Brookhaven, Governor
Noel was assured by the sheriff
that the prisoner could be protect.
ed without difficulty. The governor
accordingly sent but few troops
who were promptly overwhelmed
by the mob and the lynching took
place. Houston the governor
failed to At send troops to protect two
prisoners because the citizens of
the town assured him that they
would obey the law, but instead
the sheriff's men aided in the
lynching. Now the governor declares
that there will be no more
lynchings while he is governor if
the military in the state are able
to prevent it and uphold the law.
Even more refreshing is Governor
Noel's instructions to the state
troops. They are directed to shoot
if necessary, to protect a prisoner
from a mob and to regard any
person attacking a jail as an enemy
to the state. The South has
needed governors of firmness and
for a long time, and Mississippi is
to be congratulated in having a
Noel instead of a Vardaman
chief executive.- Omaha Bee. as

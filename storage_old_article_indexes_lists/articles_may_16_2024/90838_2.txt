his cell and locked him up. A mob of
500 people gathered at the jail and
while the sheriff was pleading with the
people to let the law take its course a
female prisoner in the corridor called
out from a window that Dougherty had
cut his throat. The sheriff found that
the murderer had taken the steel ends
of his shoe strings, flattened them out
made a two inch incision on each
and side of his throat, causing death.

Let's Help Enforce the Law! Law! the Enforce Help
Mob violence in lynchings is increasing because the mob
meets no opposition from the decent element of the community
when it seeks to execute its own decisions. If the leading citi-
zens of the town or county would fight "fire with fire" many of
these lynchings would stop. lynchings would stop.
All the lynchers are cowards and it
the black and white citizens who be-
lieve in preserving law and order
would get their shotguns and rifles
and offer their services to the sher-
aff, when the news spread that a mob
was about to form, there would be
no lynching.
It is high time for the black man
to make up his mind to help the
law enforcing officers in protecting
himself and family. A thing that is Ä¯
not worth dying for, is not worth liv-
ing for. In Savannah, Ga.. sche
years ago, a Race man was zirested,
charged with killing several white.
women, and a mob formed to lynch
him. Both black and white citizens
surrounded the jail and gave him
protection, and he was not lynched.
He was subsequently tried in court
and it was found that the wrong man
had been arrested.
Some one may say: "Well, there
will be more people killed." I.et
more people be killed; but they will
be killed trying to enforce the law,
not trying to break it. Since the law-
enforcing agency cannot uphold the
enforcement of the law themselves
from mob violence, then let the citi-
:en- who believe in the law organize
acther group to see that the law is
respected.
They are not going to stop lynch-
ing you because you kneel in prayer.
You might as well prepare yourself
to die in decency. Mob violence will
cease when men take a stand for law
enforcement. The first time the citi-
zens wipe out half of the lynchers,
there won't be much more lynching.
God is not going to stop it, nor will
prayers stop it. What the citizens
must use to maintain the law is the
same kind of instruments that the
mob uses in destroying it.

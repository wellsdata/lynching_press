LYNCH LAW IN BAKU.
The Mob Meant Business, but Falled
String Up the Thief.
ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 20.- A despatch from
Baku. on the west coast of the Caspian Sea.
says that a riot occurred there, which had its
origin in the attempts of a mob to lynch&
thief, who had been caught in the act of robbing
a bazaar. The mob got possession of the
thief, and would undoubtedly, have carried
their intentions to lynch him into effect had
not the police charged them. The mob for a
time held fast to their prisoner, and the affair
developed into a general fight.
The prisoner was finally rescued by the police
. The crowd, however, had rapily gained
accessions to their ranks, and in a short time
they turned their attention from the original
cause of the trouble and.devoted themselves
to sacking the shops of the city. The police
were absolutely powerless to prevent these
outrages, and it was found necessary to call
out the Cossack troops. The soldiers made
short work of the rioters. They charged upon
the latter, heedless of consequences, and a
large number in the crowd were injured, some
of them quite seriously.
Order was restored a very short time after
the Cossacks took a hand in in tho affair.

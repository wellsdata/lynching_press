OHIO MURDERER
MOB LYNCHES AN
Springfield, Ohio, March 8.- Richard
Dixon, a negro, was shot to death here
at night by a mob for the alleged fatal
shooting yesterday morning of Po-
ice Sergeant Charles Collins. Dixon
came from Cynthiana, Kentucky.
The mob was composed of 2,000 men,
but those who killed Dixon formed a
number far smaller than that, probably
not more than 250, most of whom entered
the county jall at 11 o'clock,
dragged Dixon to the outside of the
building, fired a number of shots into
his body, killing him, and then tied a
rope about his neck and hung him to
a telegraph pole, where the body was
riddled with bullets.
There have been eleven murders in
Clark county in the last two years and
in no instance has there been a conviction
for first degree murder, and
this fact, more than any other, is responsible
for the event of to- night, the
first lynching in the history of the
county.
There has never yet been a case of
capital punishment from this( Clark
county.)

and threaten", is, perhaps unin-
tentionally. provocative. The
phrase "police 'old" probably
meant little to the average read-
Jer after the dramatic first words.
The story goes on: ""A
white shopkeeper told po-
lice yesterday that a group
of 12 or 14 Negro men
threatened to lynch his son
early yesterday afternoon
but dispersed quickly when
he telenhoned officers of
the law."
DOING BUSINESS AS USUAL
The day after the "mob"
threat" both the intended vic-
tim" and his father, were doing
business as usual in their tavern
They were just not supposed to
be there if a real lynching threa!
had been made.
Both took time out from sel-
ling beer to "mobsters" to talk
with a Guide reporter Here's
what they said: There was no

The reporter suggested that
they slow down and start at the
beginning. They did:
About 1 p. m. Saturday a regu-
ar customer came in and saun-
tered up to the manager. He put
his arm beside the white man's
and said:
"Pops, what color is your arm?"
"It is white," the manager said.
"Uh Huh." said the customer.
"And what color is my arm?‚Äù
"It is black," the manager said.
"Yours is black, mine is white.
but it is all the same Blood is
blood. A man is a man."
The custormer shook his head.
"I'll be g-d-if, that's so." he
THREATENED TO LYNCH SON
said. "We're going to lynch your
boy because he's been going with
our women, If it was me goingi
A
with your women they'd have had
me on a tree long ago, and if you
try to stop us, d- if we don't
lynch you, Pops!"
"Who is going to do all this to
us?" the manager wanted to know.
"Me and about 30 other people"
the regular customer declared.
The manager ran away. First he
called his wife. Then he called
the police, he said. The regular
customer, with whom the manager
used to talk politics, then went out
on the street and made a speech
about races. He asked the passers-
by for lynch action, the manager'
said.
TROUBLE-MAKER LEAVES
} The trouble-maker went away
before police arrived, the manager
said, as did the others who had
been in the tavern. Only this one
man had talked. When asked if
he thought the other customers
were together in a plot against his
son, the manager said: "Oh no!"
"Well what did they do while
the man was talking?" he was
asked.
} "They didn't do or say anything."
he said,
He admitted it was hardly fair
to call persons members of a mob
just because they happened to be
buying when someone made a lyn-
ching threat, He said he had been
working with colored people for
more than 25 years and had always
got along well with them.
CIVIL RIGHTS ADVOCATE
The "intended victim" said: "You
may quote me as being a great ci-
vil rights advocate and I cam-
paigned for Victor J. Ashe!" He
had stayed at home for a few hours
after police "spirited" him away
from the tavern. He was frighten-
ed at first, when his father told
him what the regular customer
had said.
But now, he had nothing to fear
the colored people were his friends!
NORFOLK-The report published in a local paper on Sun-
day that a Negro "mob" threatened to lynch a white man on
Princess Anne road Saturday is not based on fact, an investiga-
tion by the Journal and Guide has revealed.
There was no such mob.
One unthinking resident of
the community was apparent-
ly trying to provoke trouble by
indiscreet falk in a beer tavern
before 12 or 14 other persons|
who, presumably, came there to
drink beer.
This was told the Journal and
Guide by the proprietor of the
tavern, whose son is supposed
to have been the "mob's" in-
tended victim. There had been
a rumor that the son was keep-
colored
ing company with a
woman.
The daily paper apparently
published accurately what a re-
porter took from an inaccurate,
report made in excitement by
the proprietor just after the big
had talk in the tavern.

CASE. HEARS LYNCHING
Supreme Court Considers First Order
of Kind In Its History.
Washington, D. C., Oct. 16.- For the
United
first time in its history the
States supreme court has a lynching
case before it. It comes from Tennes
see, and involves the question whether
august tribunal has been placed
the in contempt.
Ed Johnson, a negro, was lynched at
Chattanooga, Tenn., after the supreme
had issued a stay of excution,
mending court an appeal. The defendants are
Sheriff J. F. Shipp and nine deputies
and seventeen men alleged to have been
in the mob which lyrched Johnson.
Judge McReynolds, who tried Johnson,
the
is giving his moral support to
sheriff, and Judson Harmon, formerly
attorney generai, is the sheriff's counsel
. The alleged lynchers are represented
by Judge Lewis Sheppard, who
defended Johnson during his trial.
i
The answers filed with the court declare
that sheriff and his deputies
had no reason the to expect mob violence.
In the answers of the alleged members
of the mob, aside from raising an is
sue of jurisdiction, each individually
sets an alibi and submits proof to
show up nonparticipation in the lynching.

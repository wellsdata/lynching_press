Say Fictitious Tale Was Cause
Of Near Lynching in Alabama
Birmingham, Al., Jan. 31-, Al., Jan. 31
A quick, sormu mob of seve-
ral hundred men armed with guns.
pistols, knives, and clubs' was per-
suaded from lynching C. C. Sand-
erson. Negro. who was arrested;
after Mrs. Dora Cosby. wife of a.
white Bradford Mines miner, claim
ed that she had been attacked by i
1 Negro who committed a crimi-
nal assault on her and slashed her
wrist with a razor. Later, it was
discovered that there had been
no attack and that the woman in-
flicted the wound herself after an
early morning disagreement with
her husband.
Feeling ran high in the little
mining community which is about
18 miles from Birmingham. Five
Negrocs were arrested after a de-
scription was given officers by the
woman. All of the men were later
released after deputies found dis-
crepancies in the woman's story.
The razor which Ms. Cosby
claimed that she was cut with was
examined under microscopic tests
and it was found that there were
no finger prints other than her
own on the razor. It was found
outside the window wrapped in a
cloth. Her husband although will..
ing to join the mob failed to ex-!
plain to deputies the cause of her
sudden outery of rape. A search
for the alleged assailant continued
in spite of the strong belief that
the woman had used this story
of attack for another purpose.
According to Mrs. Cosby's story
she was attacked around 6:15 A. M.
a few minutes after her husband
had left to go to work in the
mines by a Negro who came into
the room and threw a pillow over
her face and with the aid of an!
accomplice who stood outside the
room, raped her. Her ten year old
daughter who was in the house at
the time was not aware of the at-
tack because the radio was play-
ing. Next door neighbors were not
aware of the attack until the wo-
man had screamed after the at-
tacker had left. He was described
as being a tall mullatto. with al
mustache and Sanderson fitted this
description. Mining authorities how
ever expressed their belief in his
innocence and he was released.
Mrs. Cosby after being examined
was not found to be
raped and
little confidence was placed in her
story by deputies assigned to the
case. Bloodhounds brought to the!
scene of the alleged attack failed
to get the tracks of the attacker.
Approximately 350 miners who had
just entered the mines to go to
work came out to join in the mob
when they heard of the attack. A
manhunt was begun over the en- â€¹
tire neighborhood and no trace was;
found of an attacker.

The community was quiet again
Tuesday morning after it had been
found out that the attack story
was fake and the feeling against

prosecuted for her story was not

day night but it is believed that
steps will be taken to disprove!

Murderers Lynched.
LAWRENCE( Ks.), June 12tb.- Peter Vinegar
, George Robinson and Ike King were
taken from jail here Saturday morning at 1
o'clock by a crowd of vigilantes and hanged
from the bridge. Robinson pleaded for his
life, and fell on his knees three times. King
said when he was about to drop," Boys, let
me down easy.." The men behind him said,
" Did you let Bandsman down easy?" and
gave the plank a shove. The necks of Vinegar
and Robinson were broken, that of King
was not. There is talk of revenge on the
part the colored people, though most of
them of say the punishment was deserved.

Riot at Los Angeles.
Our Los Angeles exchanges of the 25th
ult., come to hand containing the news of a
most appalling riot which occurred the day
previous. It would seem that the emeute
had its origin a matrimonial alliance between
two Celestials in, contrary to the wishes
of the several companies to which they be
longed. Several manifestations of displeasure,
at the union, were evinced during the afternoon
of the 23d, and on the morning of the
24th these gave way to an open ruptare, in
which knives and pistols were used ad libatum ..
At this juncture the authorities interfered,
whereupon the contending Celestials united
their strength for mutual defence against the
white barbarians. A fight ensued in which
one policeman was shot dead and a citizen
mortally wounded. This news had no sooner
spread through the city than an army of citizens
was organized which marched to the
scene of the strife, and, after forming a chain
of sentinels around, so as to prevent all egress
from the buildings in which the Chinamen
had taken refuge, laid siege to the premises.
The Celestials fought bravely, but their determined
resistence served only to strengthen
the feeling of resentment on the part of the
citizens Finally, toward evening, their complete
dislodgment was effected, when they
were disposed of as follows:
Ten were hung on the west side of Los
Angeles street below Commercial. Five
were hung at Tomlinson's Corral, and four
were shot in Negro Alley and vicinity. One
Chinawoman was shot at the commencement
of the row, by a Chinaman.
Besides those who were thus summarily
executed, many of the rioters were locked up
in jail. Some of these are suffering from
which will prove fatal. The papers
justify wounds the summary execution of the rioters.

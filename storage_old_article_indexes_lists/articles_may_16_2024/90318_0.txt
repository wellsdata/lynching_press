Two Negroes Lynched.
SELMA, Ala., April 6.- A gentleman
in from Autauga county reports finding
the bodies of two negro men floating
in Mulberry creek, about nine miles
from Selma. The two were tied together
with a rope, and their ears were
cut off. They are believed to have been
the murderers of Mrs. Jennie Rucker, in
Chilton county, several weeks ago. One
of the bodies was identified as that of a
desperate negro who resided in Chilton
county. The people of Chilton, since
Mrs. Rucker's death, will not allow an
unemployed negro to stop in that por-
tion of the country unless he has a letter
of recommendation.-

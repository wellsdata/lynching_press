Lynchings in 1913.
( The Survey.)
Fifty- two persons, fifty- one colored
and one white, were put to death by
mobs in this country in the year that
has just passed. This is twelve fewer
than the number lynched in 1912. It
is the smallest number of lynchings
in one year since records have been
kept.

Not all of these lynchings
were
merely" a kind of wild justice." Twenty
- one of the persons killed were accused
only; there had been no conviction
, no weighing of evidence.
Several innocent persons were put to
death. In Greenville, Ga., a black
man was lynched for a murder. Another
man confessed to the crime a
few days later. At Houston, Miss., a
negro accused of murder was lynched.
It was later discovered that he was
the wrong man. Two apparently innocent
colored persons were put to
death at Germantown, Ky. At Spar-
tanburg, S. C., the bravery of a
sheriff prevented a mob from lynching
a colored man accused of rape,
who was later acquitted by a white
jury.
In only ten of last year's lynchings
was" the usual crime," proved or alleged
, the crime which roused the
mob's frenzy.
To call the roll of states in this
matter may savor too much of
bringing indictments against whole
peoples. Yet ten lynchings in a single
state, Georgia's record, and nine in
another, Mississippi's, with the other
thirty- three distributed among thirteen
states, suggest that something
than the blind forces of coin-
mor cidence was at work,

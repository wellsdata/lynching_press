SAY ROOSEVELT
LEANS TO BILL
AGAINST MOBS
Anti-lynching Bill's
Supporter Told of
His Attitude
WASHINGTON, Feb. 16.-Presi-
arnt Roosevelt sent word last week
through a White House spokesman
to a Negro leader fighting for the
passage of the anti-lynching bill
that he is in favor of the measure.
it was revealed to The Amsterdam
News. The colored leader, it was
asserted, told the President's spokes-
man, that what was needed was an
open statement by Mr. Roosevelt
that he wanted the bill passed and
that his silence was insufficient.
The behind the scene attempt of
the President to show his interest
in the bill was only one indication
of the attempt of both Democrats.
and Republicans to try to rescue it
from planned oblivion, it was de-
clared.
Life was breathed into the bill
again Monday, when sixteen Sena-
tors signed a petition which is in-
tended to force another cloture vole
Wednesday. The petition was offer-
ed by Senator Minton of Indiana.
The basis for the about face on
the bill is because of the pressure
brought by thousands of white and
colored citizens all over the coun-
try on its Senate backers and ad-
ministration leaders, it was stated.
One Republican Senator who voted
against cloture received more than
100 telegrams protesting his sland.
Unfortunately for the bill is the
fact that the $250.000.000 relief bill
asked for by the President last week
may, througi Senate agreement,
take precedence over it, since may-
ors from scores of cities are clamor-
ing for more money for relief be-
cause of the large increase in t-
employment this winter. Since the
Senate
supporters of the lynch
measure come mainly from the large
industrial centers in the North, they
are now faced with rushing reflet
legislation to take care of the ad-
ditional unemployed, it was asserted.
Meanwhile, the Republican Sena-
tors who voted against cloture have
come in for much condemnation for
their stand. However, it was said
that no cloture vote on the lynch
bill can be successful without the
backing of the Republicans. The
Senate is split into four
five
groups, and, while the Republicans
do not hold the balance of power,
they can prevent a successful clo-
ture vote by siding with the bloc of
twenty-two Southern Senators.
or
It has already been rumored here
that the lynch bill Aght may be the
death of Senator Vanderberg's Pres-
idential aspirations in 1940, and that
it may also defeat any hopes Sen-
ator Lodge have of winning the Re-
pulican Vice-Presidential nomina-
tion that year. All agree that the
Republicans' stand on cloture has
complicated any drive that party
may make for the Negro vote this
year or two years hence.
Supporters of the measure say
that Senator Barkley of Kentucky,
majority leader. has leaned over
backwards in his attempt to be fair
with both sides in the epochal fight.
Meantime, Governor Chandler of
Kentucky, is capitalizing on the in-
ability of Senator Barkley to get
any legislation through the Senate.
The Governor will be Senuior Bark-
ley's opponent in the Democr√°tic
primaries for the latter's seat this
spring. it was said, and therefore
is now fighting against the lynch
bill back home. As a result, the
race issue may be the main one in
the Kentucky elections this year.

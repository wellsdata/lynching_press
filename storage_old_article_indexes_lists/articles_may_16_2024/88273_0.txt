Two People Killed and Many
Wounded- Negro is Charged
With Having Attacked White
Woman.
Winston- Salem, N. C., Nov. 17.
At least two persons are known to
have been killed and probably a score
of others injured, several seriously,
in a riot here tonight, which resulted
from the efforts of a mob of several
thousand men to storm the city jail
and lynch a negro accused of shooting
J. E. Childress and Sheriff Flint and
attacking Mrs. Childress last night.
Late tonight firing still was going
on in different parts of the city, the
mob finally having broken into small
groups. Efforts of the Home Guard
and the police to restore order were
unavailing even at that time and Governor
Byckett was asked to intervene.
He ordered Home Guards here from
Greensboro and arranged to have a
company of regular soldiers sent
Camp Polk near Raleigh. from

NEGRO PROBLEM SOLVED
The Colored Women Tell McKinley
How To Do It
Detroit, Mich., August 22.- The State
federation of colored women this afternoon
adopted a memorial to President McKin-
ley, petitioning him to ask Congress to pay
to the widow of the late Postmaster Baker
, of Lake City, S. C.,$ 40,000, her husband
having lost his life during a race riot in
that place. The memorial also states that
" we would like to ask for a law to be enacted
to this effect, that should any State
be found guilty of mob laws and lynching
it be expelled from the Union. The blacks
could then evacuate and all the negro
haters could have a State of their own
wherein they need not see a black fac√©
Thus we solve the negro problem.".

The south cannot continue these prac-
tices and retain the respect of the outside
world. It cannot continue to permit
such things and retain its own self-
respect. One species of lawlessness begets
another. The increasing number of
these lynchings is a proof of their bane-
ful effect. They do not check crime, but
advertise and encourage it. It is a duty
the southern people owe themselves to
stop this practice. They cannot afford to
stand in the light in which it presents
them to the world at large. They will be
the greatest sufferers ultimately from the
spirit of lawlessness and the disregard of
established authority.
The reputation for barbarity which
these lynchings give the south abroad is
attended by another kind of sinister advertisement
almost as evil in its effects.
The stated cause of these lynchings has
led to the belief outside of the south that
the white women are nowhere safe in
this section. Such a belief is a great exaggeration
of the true conditions, and it
causes the south to be looked upon as a
plague spot to be shunned by many white
people seeking homes. It causes immi-
to dread proximity to the southern
grants
negroes more than the pioneers dreaded
life among the Indian savages. Such
ideas of life in the south are altogether
unwarranted, of course, but they are
the advertisement which
created by
these repeated lynchings give our section

On the 4th Frank Manly was arrested
near Henrietta, Tex., on the charge of kidnaping
Sadie Barton, a pretty sixteen-
year- old girl of Kansas. He threatened
her life if she informed on him, but she
told of her treatment when he
was away.
There was of lynching Manly if the
girl's story talk proved true.

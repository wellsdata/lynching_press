Seized at Capital
Crime Confab
WASHINGTON. Dec. 13.-Protest-
ing against the failure of the na-
tional crime conference here to take
up the matter of lynching, four
pickets of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored
People were arrested here Tuesday.
The arrested men were Roy Wil-
įkinš, assistant secretary of the Na-
itional Association for the Advance-
ment of Colored People: Edward
Lovett, attorney of the Washington
branch of the association: Emmett
Dorsey, professor of political science
at Howard University, and George B..
Murphy, editor of the Washington
office of the Afro-American newg-
paper.
The pickets paraded in front of
the hall where the convention was
being held with banners demanding
that the conference
the
consider
crime of lynchings in its agenda. One
banner read: "Lynching victims
cannot speak for themselves. We
talk for them." Another said: "83
Women Lynched Since 1889."
Police arrested the men on charges
of carrying signs without a permit.
They were later released after post-
ing $5 collateral. The N. A. A. C. P.
had previously protested to Attorney
General Cummings, insisting that the
conference should include lynching
among its topics.
On Thursday, sixty N. A. A. C. P.
pickets carrying small signs, which
do not call for a permit picketed the
building in protest against
against Cum-
ming's action.

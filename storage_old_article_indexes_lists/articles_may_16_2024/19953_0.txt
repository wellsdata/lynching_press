a committee of several gentlemen went
Friday to the neighborhood where the
recent mob violence occurred and held
a joint meeting of whites and blacks to
devise some way of ending the present
troubled state of affairs.
It was not intended as an indirect
way of offering a compromise to the
mob, or securing immunity from them
in the future by promising them immunity
for the past,
The lynching was spoken of plainly
and denounced as a cowardly assassination
.
The idea and purpose was well ex
pressed by Robert Hensin, colored,
who said that he regretted the present
state of affairs; it was hurting the colored
man and hurting the property
owning white citizens. The negro de
pended on his labor; the farm owner
on his soil; their combination gave
plenty and prosperity to both. Any
disturbance of either damaged both,
and it was to the interest of both to
end such disturbance as quietly as possible
. As to what was past, that was
for the law and the officers to attend to,
and he was content to let it rest there,
for he knew their full duty would be
done. The people concerned need only
care for the future.
The negroes were frightened and
there was no pleasant feeling in having
to hurry their wives and children into
wagons and drive off and leave behind
their year's work in order to find
them left alone;
and unjustifiable.
This was done at once and the question
of what measures for future protection
was referred to a meeting
called yesterday evening at the court
house, and in which all whites and
blacks were asked to participate. The
meeting was largely attended and the
people of Lamar county spoke in no, uncertain
tone their opinion of lynch law,
and the strong and united denunciation
will have, it is hoped a good pressure
on the mob A committee of three
whites and two blacks whose names
were not divulged was appointed by the
chair look after measures of protection
jointly to with the officers.

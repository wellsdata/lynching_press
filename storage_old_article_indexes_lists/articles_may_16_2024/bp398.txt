Old French Rule Still Good Strategy French Rule Still Good Strategy

FTEN YOU are not told what
is really behind, or at bottom
of the lynching.
You are
simply told that the "Negro was
lynched for murder but you are
not told that the so-called murder
was really justifiable homicide in E
an effort to protect his wife or to
defend his life after daring to sak
for his wages.
Well, in Florida a little while
ago, they lynched two Negro boys
right under the governor's nose,
and I never learned the truth back
of the motive for the lynching
until I came south, and perhaps
never would have learned it through
any word written from Florida.
But I met a man who knows me,
and whom I have known for over
thirty years, and who was right
there where
lynching took
place, and he
me what he
the
told
would not dare even write even to
me, lest in some accidental way
he should be betrayed. I know you
marvel at such fear, but when you
consider what happened to those
two boys, you will not wonder that
no other person of that barbarous
community would dare tell what
the boys were really lynched for.
Really I cannot tell even the
southern interracial commis-
sion the name of this man:
for he would have no protec-
tion whatever and he occupies
a position which would render
him immediately vulnerable.
Those who know me, will just
have to take my word for it,
for whatever they think my
word is worth,-And this man
who finally
what he
dared not write nor eren pub-
licly tell, is no ignoramus.
He is one of the best educated
men of the south.

(
Yonu read in the papers that
two youths, 18 or 19 years old the
papers said, were lynched in north-
ern Florida, becauss one of them
cut a policeman who was "ques-
tioning them about a robbery."
Well, in the first place, I find, the
report that they were 18 and 19
years old, was made by the white
press just to cover up the horri-
ble truth that the two boys were
only 14 and 16 years old,-mere
kids.
And instead of having cut a
policeman for questioning them,
which must have seemed strange
to you in the first place, they had
simply found the policeman with
a colored woman in whom the
older boy was interested, in the
woman's room, and the two boys
gave the cop a devil of a beating
and one of them struck back at
the fighting officer with his knife,
cutting him slightly. The police-
man was off duty, as you can see,
at the time.
And why did they lynch the
boys, why did the other
policeman and their pals make
up a small mob and take the
boys out of police lockup and
kill them? JUST TO KEEP
THE CASE FROM COMING
INTO COURT WHERE
THESE BOYS COULD TELL
WHAT IT WAS REALLY
ALL ABOUT. In other words,
the
they decided to destroy
evidence, so that no court case
would be necessary.
And then because one of the
boys' fathers, knowing the truth,
was acting as if he wanted to do
something about it, they were go.
ing to put him out of the way and
he h! to flee the state. The last
heard of him, the colored people of
an Alabama town were contacting
him in a freight yard and giving
him his food in his box car, to help
him on his way to oblivion in the
west.
And that gives me occasion to
tell you something else which you
do not know, if you do not live in
the south: that colored women in
the south are being accosted, in-
sulted and annoyed by white men
of the common class now more
than ever before in their common
history of three hundred years in
this country. Really something
ought to be done about it by the
better-class whites, or by the
white women.

A Brownsville mob has lynched
Elbert Williams, 33, as a part of
the terror being imposed upon Ne-
groes for their attempt to register

and operated filling station,
was one of the first a to be driven

his wife and seven children, or to
comfort her while she is awaiting
the eighth child. She is reported
to be in need of medical attention.
No Negro newspapers are permitted
to be sold in Brownsville,
and the colored people there do not
know whether anything is being
done or not. No strange Ne-
groes are allowed in the city.
Despite the terror in
and vicinity and the threats Brownsville a-

parts of Tenn., the local officers
are determined to carry on the
work and have indicated that they

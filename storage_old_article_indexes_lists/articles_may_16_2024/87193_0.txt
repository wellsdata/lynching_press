Denver, Col., March 22.- The News and Tribune's
Alma, Col., special says: W. J. Porter, a
hard character, shot and killed Thomas Carmo-
dy to day. The murder was unprovoked, and in
less than an hour about 50 unmasked citizens
gathered at the jail and hung Porter to the ridge
pole of the jail: He swore until they put the
around his neck. He then spoke a few
rope words and said," Pull up the rope, boys."

NOT JUSTIFIED
Vicksburg, Miss., June 15.- The
Daily Herald is leading the press
of the state in denouncing the
lynching of Lee Fox, a Negro, who
killed Lee Reynolds, white, with
whom he had been shooting craps.
Fox was lynched by 50 men near
Blaine, 10 hours after he had killed
Reynolds. Both men had been
attending a dance, and had been
shooting craps with a crowd of
whites and Negroes all night, and
had been drinking. Reynolds had
won all Fox's money.
Angered at his loss, Fox shot
Reynolds as he walked from the
room at 2 a. m.
Commenting on the lynching,
the Herald says:
" We never before read of so unjustifiable
and revolting a case of
lynching. Certainly the white
men who would lynch a Negro for
killing a white man who had so
grossly violated the color line code,
were not Southern born. And if
tried before a jury of Southern
men these lynchers would surely
be convicted, of murder.

LYNCHING.
According to the Chicago Tribune
of Dec. 31st, 127 persons were
mobbed and lynched in this country
during the year 1898; 122 of
these were males and five males.
Of these lynchings 118 occurred
in the south and 9 in the north;
102 were negroes, 23 whites and
2 Indians. The alleged crimes for
which the victims were lynched
were as follows: Theft, 6; arson,
2; violation of contract, 1; insults,
2; murder, 61; attempted rape, 7;
race prejudice, 3; unknown, 3; rape,
16; miscegenation, 1; resisting arrest
, 1; suspected of murder, 13;
complicity in rape, 1; assaults upon
whites, 4; mistaken identity, 2;
murderous
highway robbery 1;
,
assault, 2; burglary, 1.
Glancing over these figures it
will be observed that seven negroes
were mobbed and lynched for attempting
to rape white women and
one was similarly dealt with upon
the theory that he was aiding his
companion to commit such a rash
act. Therefore, out of the 102
negroes who were mobbed and
lynched the past year, only 24 were
charged with attempting to outrage
white women. Yet those who are
in favor of mob and lynch law
contend this is the only crime
negroes are lynched for. But these
figures prove to the contrary.
The Tribune also gives a detailed
list of the number of lynchings
which have taken place during a
of years, and they are as
series follows:

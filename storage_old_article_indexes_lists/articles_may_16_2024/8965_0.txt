-
When Taken to Drug Store to
Be Identified by Victim, He
Again Drew Revolver, and
Was Knocked Down.
At the Long Island Hospital Albert
Breeze, a conductor on a Brooklyn and
Coney Island street car, is said to be
in a dying condition as the result of
a bullet wound inflicted by Amenello
Crimaldi a saloonkeeper at No. 227
Johnson, street, Brooklyn.
The shooting followed a vicious as-
Bault upon Breeze by Crimaldi. The
latter also attempted to shoot the po-
liceman who arrested him, and was
threatened with lynching by the crowd
that saw his assault on the conductor
and attempted murder of the police-
nan. Only the arrival of Capt. Har-
kins and a squad of police saved the
Italian from the vengeance of the mob.
According to the story of passengers
who were on the car Crimaldi was
standing on the footboard of the car
smoking a cigar. Breeze politely asked
him to step inside, saying it was against
the rules to stand on the footboard.
Crimaldi paid no attention to the request
, and Breeze spoke to him again.
Three times the conductor made the
request in quiet tone, and each time
Crimaldi refused a to obey.
Mob Threatens Lynching.
Before Crimaldi recovered the mob
surrounded Owens and his prisoner and
began shouting." Lynch him!"
As they were about to attack the
Itallan Capt. Harkins and a squad of
police came up and took charge of him.
He was taken back to where Breeze was
lying in a drug store, and on reaching
there he again attempted to draw his
revolver. He was again knocked down
by Owens.
Breeze revived sufficiently to identify
Crimaldi as the man who shot him and
was taken to the Long Island Hospital,
where it was said his chances of recov-
erv were slight.
At the station- house Crimaldi was
searched and a gold badge bearing the
number 554, and showing him to be a
deputy sheriff. was found on him. When
asked why he had shot Breeze he
plied," That's my business." re-

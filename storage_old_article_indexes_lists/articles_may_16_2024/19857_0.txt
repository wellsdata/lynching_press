Of Two Lynchings

Wants Postponement,
To Let Protest Die
TUSCALOOSA, Aug. 24. The
Grand Jury, supposed to be" investigating
" the lynching on Aug. 13 of
Dan Pippen, Jr., and A. T. Harden,
has been recessed again until Sept.
5, in the hope that the general indignation
over the lynchings will
have cooled off, and a whitewash of
Judge Henry B. Foster, Sheriff R. L.
Shamblin, the two deputies and private
detective in charge of the Ne
groes when they were murdered, can
be passed off smoothly.
No attempt has been made to reconcile
or even cover up the obvious
discrepancies in the stories told by
officials. Although a Birmingham
Negro paper has pointed out that a
boy on a bicycle could have reached
Birmingham from Tuscaloosa in less
than the four and a half hours that
went by between the time the sheriff's
car" speeded" out of Tusca
loosa and the time the deputies re
ported the lynching, no effort has
been made to even explain this discrepancy
.
It was a Negro doctor, B. B. Mit
chell, who turned Elmore Clark, accidental
survivor of the lynching, over
to Sheriff Shamblin a second time,
it was learned here.
Attorney General Thomas E.
Knight, Jr., notorious for his stub
born fight to legally lynch the
Scottsboro boys, asked for the recess.
He is in charge of the" investigation
."
In justification for the lynching,
and the violent ejection of International
Labor Defense lawyers, the
Tuscaloosa News, local daily, says
editorially:
" Social equality never has been, is
not now, and never will be recognized
in the South. Those who came
to preach a different order always
have been, are now, and always
be repulsed." will

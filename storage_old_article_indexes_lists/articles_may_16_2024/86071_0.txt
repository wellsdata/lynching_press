EXCITEMENT AT LOUISVILLE, KY.
LOUISVILLE, KY., Feb. 27.- A man calling himself John
Haskell, and hailing from Massachusetts, but who is said
to be an Englishmar and a sailor, from New Orleans,
was arrested in this city on Saturday, for practising an
outrageous crime on three boys.
His examination to- day, was postponed, on account of
the illness of one of the witnesses.
This forenoon, a crowd gathered about the Court
House, increasing in numbers till two o'clock, when the
Mayor ordered a steam fire engine(!) to the spot to drive
away the crowd. This was temporarily successful, but
towards dark the crowd swelled till it numbered several
thousand, and an attack on the jail and application of
lynch law to the prisoner was apprehended.
The military was ordered to hold themselves in readiness
. Two pieces of cannon were placed inside the
jail, and the police marshalled. The latter kept the
square front of the jail clear, and arrested several intoxicated
in and turbulent persons.
This evening Judge Bullock addressed the crowd, saying
that the parents of the victims desired no riotous
proceedings, but were willing that the prisoner should
be dealt with by the law, and councelling moderation.
At this time,( ten o'clock, P. M.,) the crowd is gradually
dispersing, although a spirit of great indignation
exists against the prisoner. The fears of an attack
still on the jail to- night are subsiding.

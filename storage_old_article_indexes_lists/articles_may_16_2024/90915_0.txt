shooting, and however atrocious the
deed committed by Wyatt, the crime
was nothing in comparison to the
crime committed against society, law
and order by the best and most enlightened
citizens or Christians of that
community, for they were not satisfied
of transforming themselves into
bloodthirsty hyenas while seeking the
life- blood of their victim and after he
had fell into their hands he was not
decently shuffled off this mortal coil.
But he was mobbed and lynched.
Then these highly civilized Christians
knocked his brains out with an ax and
his body into a large bonfire,
throwed which had been built near the jail.

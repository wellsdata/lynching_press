The Courier- Journal affects to believe
that the mob which lynched Meara, in
Illinois, for roasting his little son to
death on a hot stove, was a Ku- Klux
gang, and ought to be prosecuted by the
government. There may be something
about Kentucky whisky which befuddles
the editorial reason, or there may be a
constitutional weakness in some men
which makes them Democrats, and we
rather think there is, otherwise it is impossible
to account for the very big streak
of stupidity that runs through the fatness
of the Courier- Journal in general
paper ability. news

NEGRO RAPIST LEWIS HANGED.
Fairfax, Va., June 4.- James Lewis,
colored, who was recently convicted of
criminal assault on Mrs. Reidell, of this
place, was hung at 5:03 this morning in
the jail yard in the presence of about
fifty people. Lewis was quite cool and
walked to the gallows without assistance.
There was no demonstration of violence
on the part of the crowd.
The crime for which Lewis suffered
the extreme penalty of the law was that
of ravishing Mrs. Ida Reidell, a white
woman, who lived with her son, some
miles below Alexandria. The crime was
a brutal one and stirred the indignation
of the people of the surrounding country
almost to the lynching point. Lewis was
soon captured but stoutly maintained his
innocence. A remarkable feature of the

find being unable to agree, and in the
last trial declaring him guilty and imposing
the death penalty. Lewis

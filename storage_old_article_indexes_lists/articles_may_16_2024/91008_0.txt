the stake here ten days ago.
The prisoner Clyde Woodward, 21
years old, who is charged with murder
, was taken to the county jail at
West Chester. The ruling created a
sensation here. It was made in the
case of George Stahl, 16 years, old
whose parents sought his release on
a writ of habeas corpus, in refusing
the application the Judge said:
" One is responsible for his actions
if he associates himself with a mob
even if he gives no physical assistance
but merely sanctions violence.
Then he is just as guilty, of murder
under the law as if he helped to commit
murder Stahl sympathized with

trbulent mob. He cannot complain
now of the justice that he receives."
It is said that a number of persons
who are known to be in the mob, but

who assisted to mob and lynch Zack
Walker, may yet hang up by
until they are dead. necks

Horace Maples in the Supreme Court.
The Horace Maples case has been
advanced the supreme court
upon
docket, and a final decision is expected
at an early day. The case is even
now attracting no little attention in
Virginia and other states.
The broad question raised in it relates
to the fourteenth amendment. A
member of the mob that lynched Hor-
ace Maples was indicted by a federal
grand jury, and he sued out a writ of
habeas corpus on the ground that the
offense for which he was indicted is
one against the state of Alabama, not
the United States.
The contention on the one side is
that, as Horace Maples was a citizen
of the United States and was in jail
awiting trial, he could not be deprived
of life without the formality of a trial,
and if a mob intervenes the members
of that mob can be punished under
the fourteenth amendment. The Rich-
mond Times- Dispatch seems to accept
this view of the case, when it says:
" Under the fourteenth amendment
there is such a thing as a' citizen of
the United States,' and every such
citizen has guaranteed rights which
the government must protect."
The trouble with this view of the
case is, it has no limits. If the mob
that hung Horace Maples can be punished
under the terms of the four-
teenth amendment, it is difficult to see
what is left to the state court. Hor-
ace Maples and the man he killed, and
all the members of the mob at Hunts-
ville lived in this state, and if the matter
from beginning to end is not an
Alabama affair, then we do not know
what would be.
Speculation is, however, idle. The
decision of the supreme court will
doubtless draw the line somewhere.
The fourteenth amendment is not so
the Richmond Times-
boundless as
Dispatch contends it is, and the court
of last resort will perhaps render a
decision that will determine an intricate
problem. The drawing of the
line between state and federal jurisdiction
possibly will render the forthcoming
decision a historic piece
constitutional interpretation. of

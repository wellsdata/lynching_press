Lynch Law in the North
The lynching of a negro in Penn-
sylvania who had shot down a patrolman
and the lynching of another
negro in Oklahoma should not, and
probably will not, encourage lynching
in the south. In this section of the
country lynchings are annually decreasing
, and youthful sports are
looking in other directions for recreation
. As a rule any set of lynchers
is largely made up of boys and young
men, and its brutaliing tendencies
are in that way rendered doubly
.
harmful.
The mob's action in Chester county,
Pennsylvania, was wholly inexcusable
. No crime against women was
involved. A drunken negro shot down
a patrolman who was trying to arrest
him. Chester county lies between
Lancaster and Philadelphia,
and the main line of the Pennsyl-
vania railroad crosses it Coalsville,
the county seat, is a town of about
12,000 people. Why those people
should have permitted a mob to burn
at the stake a wounded who
negro
had tried to commit suicide and who
would have been hung if he had lived,
is a bit remarkable, and Governor
Tener will no doubt strive to bring
the lynchers to punishment.
The entire business simply suggests
a little more mildness of expression
in Pennsylvania papers when a lynch-
ing occurs in the south. It does not
excuse or palliate in the least southern
lynchings, it simply suggests
that human nature is the same in all
states, and that the frailties of one
section would under like circumstances
become the frailties of any
other section.
As things are going, the south may
soon be called upon to become an example
to the east and the west in race
troubles This would not be unreasonable
. in view of the greater experi-
ence of the south in handling questions
involving race distinctions and
prejudices. Step by step the south
is meeting this problem and it will
solve it. It has solved all questions
that have come before it, and it will
solve the one that led to a lynching in
agricultural community descended
from an the Quakers in Pennsylvania.

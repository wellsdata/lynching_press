TRIAL OF
THE MAFIA
It is close to twenty- three years
ago that the death knell of the Mafia
in America was sounded, rung by
the best citizens of New Orleans in
their fury of what they believed was
a miscarriage of justice. This organization
was originally a political
one in Italy, but in this country it
had degenerated into a band of assassins
. New Orleans, in a measure,
was its headquarters, and this city
found the most difficulty in its suppression
, and it was the people and
not the law that brought it about.
The means to the end of the organization
was the murder of Chief
of Police David C. Hennessy of New
Orleans. The Mafia, or rather the
Stopaghera, the proper name of the
order, consisted of a large number of
Italians, mostly Sicilian by birth,
their early leader having been Giu-

made, for so secretly did the body
work that it was impossible to detect
them.
The capture of the brigand Espo-
sito in 1881, and his surrender to the
Italian government, resulted in several
killings. The Stopagherra determined
to avenge the killing of their
comrade. Engrossed in his search to
weed out this murde: ous organiza-
tion, Chief of Police Hennessy had
no idea that he was being watched.
He probably knew nothing of a certain
Italian neighbor of his, Monas-
terio by name, lately arrived from
fifty
abroad, occupying a shanty
yards from his house.
It was nearly time for Hennessy
to spring the trap and to make a
full exposure, when late one evening,
he drew near home, a boy ran in
as front of him and gave a peculiar
Whistle. The next moment the chief
was a dying man. Bullets tore three
cruel rents in his abdomen, his right
knee and his left hand were shot
through, and his face, arms and neck
were frightfully mutilated.
Within ten minutes of the shooting
the immigrant was seized in his
shanty. Other arrests followed, but
only eleven were held and only nine
finally prosecuted. The trial proved
that Hennessy's assassins hid in Mo-
nasterio's cottage and that an Italian
boy was posted to notify them of
Hennessy's approach. The deadly
weapons were found, five with barrels
sawed off and stocks hinged so
that they could be doubled up and
carried under the clothing.
Hennessy had been murdered on
October 15, 1890, and the Italians
who were arrested in connection with
the deed remained in prison until
the early part of March of the fol-
lowing year, when they were placed
on trial before Judge Baker, the
hearing of evidence requiring about a
week. A verdict was rendered. on
Friday, March 13, 1891.
The judge, usually imperturbable,

handed him, to look at it a moment in

a
fiasco was an outrage.
Awaiting a trial upon a second indictment
and joyfully reckoning upon
a similar result next time, the accused
were again locked in their
cells. At the moment the doors closed
behind them a vigilance committee of
well known citizens was writing a

The assemblage was so
this meeting that it blocked the
street cars and climbed upon them.
What was the outcome of this meeting
? The citizens took the law in
their own hands. A mob- but in
good order- started for the Parish
prison, where the prisoners were
confined. They battered down the
doors. Nine of the prisoners were
put to death in various ways by the
mob and two of them were hanged
outside of the prison walls.

nounced the verdict and declared that
the jury had been bought. The grand
jury, even on the day of the killing,
had found indictments against two
men charged with tampering with
the jury. The jurors did not appre-
the
ciate the public sentiment on
outside and were surprised at the
popular indignation. The trial of the
case had cost the city more than
$ 30,000 and then was a miscarriage
of justice.
The incident opened grave international
complications which Secretary
Blaine handled with skill. Twenty-
five thousand dollars was finally distributed
among the families of the
murdered men. On March 17, three
days after the prisoners were disposed
of, several arrests were made
for bribery of the jury, and on May
5, the grand jury, after an investigation
for six weeks, indicted O'Malley
and five associates for jury bribing
and accused three of the jury of being
bribed, but refused to indict the
lynchers. On July 8, Bernard Giaudi
was convicted of offering to bribe a
juror. On July 24, the last Mafia
bribery case was ended with a verdict
of not guilty, and on October 9
the state abandoned the case against
O'Malley, which finally settled the
whole affair

LYNCHED THE RUGGLESES.
Tired of the Law's Delay, a Mob Hangs
the Two Stage Robbers.
REDDING, Cal., July 25.- The wrath of
the people here against tne coddling of
stage robbers and murderers and the needless
delay of their trial burst all bounds
yesterday morning, and ended in the lynching
of John D. and Charles Ruggles, who
robbed the Redding stage in May last, secured
$ 6,000 in bullion and killed Wells-
Fargo Express manager Buck Montgom-
ery. Both men were young and of good
family. They had no motive for their
crime, except the pure deviltry of the elder
brother, who thought he was a dime
hero. novel

DOUGLAS REPLIES
TO EDITORIAL IN
CHICAGO TRIBUNE
Birmingham Man Resents
Unjustified Slur on Whole
South for Lynching of
Leo M. Frank
Angered by an unjustified and uncalled.
for slur on the south as a whole by the
Chicago Tribune, Judge Alvin M. Douglas
of Birmingham, now visiting in the Hli-
nois city, has written a letter to the edi-
tor of the Tribune in which he resents
the fling of the editorial.
Judge Douglas' letter, addressed to the
editor of The Tribune, follows:
" LEO M. FRANK.
" Please allow a few words. from
a
southerner, who feels keenly the attack
you made on the south this morning in
an editorial published under the above
head.
I live in Birmingham, Ala., and
was in Atlanta just after Governor Slaton
commuted the sentence of Frank. Many
people thought Governor Slaton made a
mistake, but they were submissive to the
law and the action taken by Slaton. It was
a rough, lawless and rowdy element that,
at the time
would do violence to the
governor, as it was in those who brutally
murdered Frank.
The good people of
Georgia and the south do not approve of
lawlessness and condemn the actions of
the mob who took the life of the Georgia
prisoner. This act is to be very much
deplored and condemned and, while I was
away from home, returning from the Pacific
coast when I heard of the tragedy.
I am sure I do speak for the south when
I say they do condemn and disapprove
of such acts of lawlessness.
" There may be fault on the part of
the authorities at the prison; there may
have been fault in lack of organization
; there was fault and bad spirit in
the breast of the mob, but does this war
rant you in attacking the southern people
as you have? It is to be regretted that
the editor of a great paper anywhere in
our country should so forget himself in
the heat of passion and attack and convention
demn all the people of any section of his
own country because of the violence and
mob spirit of about 25 men, who were
not willing to let the law take its course.
south is half
It is a region of illiteracy, blatant self-
and violence. Until
it is improved by the invasion of better
blood and better ideas to the American
reproach and a danger to the American
republic.' Shame on you! Do you know
the southern people? Have you ever been
south of the Mason and Dixon line?
Someone has said,' Do the best you can
with what you have where I
'
you are.
grant the south is not as highly educated
as some other sections of our great
country, but have we not done well with
the opportunities given us?
" Blatant self- righteousness. The Lord
have mercy on your soul! Judge not that
ye be not judged." Who put you up to
judge the southern people? Oh, thou self-
appointed judge and critic! Why not
write something on this deplorable affair
that would help the south and the country
to correct the evils of this kind rather
than slap in the face a great people, loyal
and true to state, nation and righteous
ness and good government?
" Better blood!" God forgive you for
this the most unkind words of all I
,.
know not what kind of blood courses
through your veins- and care not. Your
unwise and uncalled for words probably
burst forth from a lack of training and
education and regard for the feelings of
others, rather than from the cause of
blood Moreover I challenge to
. you
,
show in this country any purer Anglo-
Saxon blood than flows through the veins
of our southern people. They are a great
people, though they labored for years under
adverse circumstances. They are loyal
to country: true to state: obedient to
law; chivalrous to women and hospitable
to mankind everywhere.
" As the mob who lynched Frank does
not in any way express the sentiment of
the southern people, I am sure your editorial
does not express the sentiment of
your section of our country. I have heard
expressions this morning in Chicago condemning
the editorial. The mob committed
a great wrong; you have erred. Do
editorials of this kind help to make our
common country better or worse? You
should use your brain for the uplift of
the nation and the betterment of mankind
, rather than expressing sectional
feeling. Think it over.
" I resent with all the force of my soul
this attack on the people among whom
I was born, with whom I live, and with
whom expect to die.
I" ALVIN M. DOUGLAS."

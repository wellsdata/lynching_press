One man said that it started from a remark
dropped by Prosecutor Wiltsie, but
that was hooted at. It was said that Mr.
Wiltsie had said something about Burton
and about lynching while getting shaved.
This could not have been true, however, for
Mr. Wiltsie did not get shaved to- day. While
the rumor has not been given any credence,
and it is believed to have started here from
some idle talk, Sheriff Spiegel thought
enough of it to take some extra precautions
in order to be prepared for any emergency
. Instead of having the one guard
at the jail, who has been on night duty
since Burton was brought here, there will
be twe or more men awake and on guard all
night and others within easy access in case
of an emergency.
There is another, and perhaps a more
sensible, reason for increasing the guard
to- night. Almost at the same time the rumor
was going the rounds about the Indian-
apolis mob that was to lynch Burton there
also floated into life a story of a mob of
the opposite character. It was reported that
some of Burton's friends were coming here
to him. Burton also heard this and
said free:

GREENFIELD, Ind., Nov. 25. James
Burton had quite a scare to- night when the
rumor reached him that a mob was
over from Indianapolis to lynch him. coming

MOB LAW RULES.
Reign of Terror in Indiana Towns
Caused by Desperate Characters.
Versailles, Ind., Nov. 2.- Since the
announcement that Gov. Mount has
abandoned hope of convicting members
of the mob which lynched five men
here some time ago, the lawless element
is becoming vindictive.
The law is not enforced against the
perpetrators of the robberies, barn
burnings and highwaymen, and the
farmers are again becoming very rest
less. An uprising similar to that which
swept Jackson County several years
ago may be the result.
A reign of terror exists near Ellwood,
Ind., owing to mysterious assaults
upon the family and home of Charles
Waymire, a prominent farmer.
His
sons and daughters have been assault-
and his house bombarded at
by bowlders and bullets. night

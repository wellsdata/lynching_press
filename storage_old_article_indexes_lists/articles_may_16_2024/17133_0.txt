WHAT THEY SAY OF US.- We clip the following
paragraph from the Philadelphia North
American's correspondent, dated at Berlin, to
show in what light European Journalist represent
the people of the United States, and the
working of their institutions. Verily, despotism
must rest on an insecure foundation when
its advocates have no resort to such means to
prop it up and make it tolerable:
" It is amusing to read the' news from America
' in European newspapers. With the exception
of a few English journals, they all allow
as little space as possible to the news from the
United States, and their selection of items indicates
very plainly a desire and purpose to
make our country appear as bad as possible.
Every murder, robbery or other atrocious crime;
every steamboat explosion or railroad accident;
every house that falls down and kills the people
under it in New York; every riot attended with
bloodshed at the West
; every fight on the floor
of Congress and every rotten egg thrown at
:
the hat of the President for refusing to take a
drink with a tipsy Representative; every disastrous
failure or peculation; every raging epidemic
, as the cholera or yellow fever, is certain
to be recorded in all the
Such news is sometimes stated when in Europe;
a beautiful
conciseness. A leading Berlin journal, three or
four days ago, chronicled the arrival of a steamer
in New York from California, adding the following
simple summary of its news:" Murders,
robberies, conflagrations, duels and Lynch law
are the order of the day." When one takes up a
journal here to read American news, he can
never expect to find anything more than a cat-
ologue of crimes, excesses and casualities; and
I must do this catologue the justice to say that
it is generally complete, or, at least, no
are spared to make it so." pains

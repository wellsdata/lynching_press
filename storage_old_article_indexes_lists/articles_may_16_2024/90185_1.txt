Negro Chased by a Mob.
Indianapolis Journal.
Special to the
ALEXANDRIA, Ind., July 27.- Only the
fleetfootedness of Daniel Reed, a colored
saloon porter in this city, saved the town
from a lynching last night when he assaulted
and cut Martin Taylor and later attacked
Mrs. Richard Hollis who interfered.
An angry mob soon collected and pursued
with the intention of lynching Reid, who
chased a mile in the country and lost
was in the darkness.

" I have been shocked," he said," by
the attitude of the senator from South
Carolina on more than one occasion
when he has spoken here in justifica-
tion and support of the continuance
of lynching. If there is one man who
.
ought not to encourage it is the man
who sits here as the maker of laws.
" Any man who encourages lynching,
murder and lawlessness will have
much to answer for and the higher
his position and the mightier his influence
the more will he have to answer
for. No man can come here with
good grace to impeach the president
for his dismissal of men because they
were not identified as criminals who
comes to that accusation from
a
lynching bee or who justifies."
Senator Spooner one

Lynchings, which in the last two
years have shown a gratifying decline,
are again on the way up in the United
States. One of the most horrible
crimes in recent years was the triple
lynching of three Negroes in South
Carolina. These victims were taken
from the fall and killed, although one
of them had just been declared inno-
cent after trial, and the other two,
one a woman, had been granted a new
trial. It is alleged that the police
oficers were accomplices in this crime.
The public authorities of South Caro-
lina were as usual doing nothing until
Walter White of the National Associa-
tion for the Advancement of Colored
People and later The New York World
goaded them into action. It is yet
too soon to predict that there is cour-
age enough and decency enough in
South. Carolina to bring the lynchers
to justice.
Not to be behind hand in crime,
Texas reports a triple lynching for
. reasons unknown! Two of the victims
a man and his wife-were burned
to death in their cabin. This in the
country of the Fundamentalists, who
pride themselves on their religious
zoal.
In view of these facts and others
like them, it is high time to revive
agitation for a Federal Anti-Lynching
Law. It would, of course, have been
better if the State had taken care
of this matter. A Federal law will not
be self-enforcing. Nevertheless.
American citizenship means anything.
it means the right to life as against
the mob. The United States is bound
to guarantee that to its Negro citizens.
Undoubtedly the previous agitation
Anti-Lynching Bill_in
responsible for
for the Dyer
Congress was partly
the improvement in the South. This
time support should be given to the
bill in dead earnest. There is no room
for sectional feeling in this matter.
nor can the North, in view of its own
race rlots, assume a holler-than-thou
attitude. All of us as decent citizens
must get together to remove from the
United States a disgrace which not
shared by the most backward n

Labor.

The Register adds:-
Perhaps there never was a case which
more strongly illustrated the want of a Penitentiary
than this. He had a monomania for
stealing, and has been convicted capitally, we
believe, threeseveral times for horse- stealing,
but escaped each time, either by craving the
benefit of clergy or through some defect in
,
the record. He was finally hung for grand
, the article stolen, we think, being a
larceny pair of suspenders from a store.

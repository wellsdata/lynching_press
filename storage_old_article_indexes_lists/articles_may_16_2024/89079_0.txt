AFFAIR PROMISED
TO LOOK VERY UGLY
Sending of Troops to Linden
Seems Justified
BEST CITIZENS REGRET IT
Governor Will Have to Appoint Sheriff
In Macon County and Commissioner
In Lowndes
County.
Montgomery, July 21 .-( Special.)- Evidence
is beginning to come out that there
was something of a county movement to
mob the negro Richardson in jail at Linden
Tuesday night, to prevent which
the governor sent the Selma troop under
command of Maj. V. B. Atkins to
guard the jail. Letters have been received
which go to show that the matter
had been worked up and that the
movement was general. For instance to-
aay a letter reached the office of the
governor from a prominent citizen of
Demopolis to the effect that he knows
that two young men of that town went
to join a mob to lynch the negro, and
it is intimated that others also went.
It is to the lasting credit of Marengo
county, however, that there was none of
its best men so far as known, in the ef-
comfort and it has been shown by the letters
received that the better class of
citizens earnestly regret the occurrence
and will do everything in their power
to keep down anything of the kind in
the future. They feel that the affairs of
this kind in county in the past were
not preventable because they could not be
reached in time to protect the accused,
and will see to it that henceforth
will be no mobbing if they can help there it.

A Rape Fiend Lynched.
MEMPHIS, Tenn., Feb. 11.- A negro
named Fields, who assaulted Mrs. Jack
White a few miles from this city, was
lynched today at Forest Hill by several
hundred citizens. The victim, after recovering
her composure, identified the
negro fully, and it was with difficulty
that the woman's husband was prevented
from shooting him. Field, when
confronted by his accuser, confessed his
crime. He was then taken to a convenient
tree and hanged. No holes were
shot in him. The sheriff and a posse
some hours later, but could do
arrived nothing.

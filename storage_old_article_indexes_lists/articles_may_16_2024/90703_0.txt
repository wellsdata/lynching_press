caps he still moves forward, they imposed
upon him additional tests of
citizenship for the purpose of staying
his onward march; they imposed
many limitations upon his progress-
political, civil, moral and industrial;
but he has met all these tests by accumulating
more than a billion dollars
worth of property, has reduced
his illiteracy 70 per cent in the short
spac of fifty years and he has produced
some of the greatest leaders of
thought and action that this country
has ever seen. But, the more education
he acquire, the more wealth he
obtains, the more he attempts to advance
upwards, the more he is oppressed
, segregated, lynched, disfranchised
and burned at the stake;
and now, his feet bleeding against
the flinty rocks in the pathway of his
progress, he is standing with his back
to the wall and crying out in the
language of the soldier of the cross,
Where do we go from here?"

Grenada is usually a very quite, the
peaceful town, but Wednesday night
was a notable exception. There was a suffer
hurrying to and fro and much excitement
, for a lynching was in the wind.
Between 9 and 10 o'clock there was a
daring attempt on the part of a brutal
negro to commit an outrage on a young
white lady. Alex Anderson, a copper
colored negro about 21 years old, and
with a very unsavory reputation, was
the criminal. He was seen lurking line
about the scene of the attempted outrage
several nights ago, and had been
warned away by a member of his own
race. He returned Wednesday night
and was evidently lying in wait in a have

Place of concealment an opportuni- pose
ty to commit the helish deed, the de-
of which was consuming him. He still
thought he saw his chance when the ning
young lady was just in the act of step- ture
ping into the house from the yard. He both
seized and tripped her and end√©avored
to smother her screams with his hand. less
Fortunately, however, her screams They
were heard by a colored man who hap- tle
pened to be near and ran to her rescue. they
The cowardly instincts of the brute
prompted him to seek safety in rapid ply
flight. In the precipitency of his departure
he neglected to carry away his
cap. It is seldom that a criminal conceals
all his tracks, so in this case the
cap gave a clew that made the detection
of the fiend a matter of slight difficulty
. It was identified as the prop the
erty of Alex Anderson. In fact he was
known to have worn it that very evening
. The authorities were at once notified
of the crime and telegraphed to
Water Valley for blood hounds. In
the meantime a large number of citizens
had been aroused and were out in
search of the black demon A number

of them went to Anderson's home, this
where they found him with many evidences
of recent exertion. His respiration
and perspiration were in a state
of great activity. He was asked where If
his cap was and replied that he had no are
cap, that he wore a hat. His hat was
then demanded, and he produced one
from a trunk which was bran new and
had never been worn. This was evidence
enough to damn him, and he was
hustled away to jail. and
The blood hounds arrived from Water
Valley and were put on the trail.
They followed it by a very circuitous
route and finally brought up to Ander-
son's home. day

The crowd on the streets, which included
some of the very best citizens of
Grenada, had increased in numbers the one
while, and was under pressure of considerable
excitement.
After Anderson had been placed in
jail the evidence which accumulated
against him became so strong as to
amount to certainty of his guilt in the ern
mind of every one, and immediate action
was finally decided upon, and the
crowd proceeded to the jail, where the do
Sheriff and his deputy soon arrived.
They were seized, overpowered and
the jail keye secured.
Anderson, who, up to the last mo For
ment, appeared utterly indifferent as
to his fate, was taken from the jail to

to understand that it was useless to
further protest his innocence, as his
guilt had been beyond all ques
proven-
tion. He then made a full confession,
palliating his offense by saying an evil
spirit prompted him to the commission said
of
of the deed. He evidently expected to
receive a much lighter punishment
than death as he requested to be given
,
a good whipping after making his confession
.
Several places for executing vengeance
were tested, but the wretch was
finally taken to the cotton wood tree at
the southwest corner of the public a
square. The two ends of a rope were
attached to Anderson's neck and a convenient
limb respectively, and in
obedience to a command from one of
his executioners, he climbed the tree
and was then pushed off. He presented

persons to leave the body hanging till
noon.
Alex Anderson has heretofore borne
a very bad reputation. Several years
go he entered and robbed several
private houses besides committing
therein some outrageous acts, and
writing to the inmates obscene and
disgusting notes, at which time he O.
made a narrow escape. He was sent to
the penitentiary about two years ago
for burglary, and returned only a few
weeks ago.
Anderson's body was cut down at
9:45 Thursday morning, and a coroner's to
held, who, after examining a
inquest to
number of witnesses, returned the following
verdict:" We, the jury, find
that Alex Anderson came to his death
by parties unknown, by being hung by
the neck with a rope."
While the SENTINEL, in common
with all good citizens, ordinarily de-
plores lynch law, still we recognize the
fact that it is the only way to deal with
the devlish rape- flend. Any person
guilty of that unspeakable crime must
suffer speedy death. While every one
doubtless deplores the necessity for the
lynching, still every one approves it.
Many of the best colored people them- the
selves have been heard to unqualifiedly
indorse the lynchers of
night. Wednesday lay

Chicago. At 6:30 the other night
sixty- one- year- old William McClean,
1149 West Washington boulevard,
walked into John Bonaris' restaurant
on Aberdeen street. From 6:30 to
6:40 William busied himself eating
some 30- odd cents' worth of food.
At 6:41 William refused to pay for
the food and the trouble started. John
called William names and William
drew a revolver and started to shoot.
John dived behind the counter, came
up with two large pistols of his own
and started in to show William what
real shooting was. William fled north
on Aberdeen street to Madison street.
John followed and shots flew thick
and fast.
There was a Salvation Army meet.
ing on the corner. William landed in
the middle of the drum, kicked his
way clear, spilling the collection, and
fled toward May street with a tambourine
over his left ankle.
A thoughtful citizen on the third
floor of one of the Madison street lodging
houses thought William should
stop. He landed a water pitcher on
William's head. William took a couple
of shots at the man, but his aim was
poor ..
A mob, the Salvation Army and
John closed in rapidly from the rear.
William started west again, not without

bullets, William tried to shoot at the

explode. They grappled and the police
man got the revolver.
John raced up and demanded immediate
execution of William. He waved
his own revolver and threatened to
get justice himself. The patrolman
pushed a regulation revolver into Wil
liam's ribs and made him open the
patrol box, call the Desplaines street
station, and put in a riot call.
Ten minutes later a wagon load of
bluecoats arrived on the scene. They
started to club their way through the
mob. Cries of" Lynch the bandit" had
been started and mingled with the
prayers for" peace" on the part of
the Salvation Army.
It ended with the police forcing a
way through to Bernacchi and his
prisoner. They were put into the
wagon. John also was put in with the
man who had refused to pay for his
food. Both went to the station and
both were locked up on a charge

NEGRO OUTLAW LYNCHED.
Simon Cooper Captured and Hanged
by a Mob.
SUMTER, S. C., Jan. 8.- Simon Cooper
, the negro outlaw, who yesterday
murdered three members of the Wilson
family and a colored servant, was
lynched near here today. Cooper was
captured by the sheriff's posse and
was being taken to Sumter, when the
mob decided to hang him. The deputy
sheriff, aided by two men, resisted the
lynchers, but was overpowered. A rope
was thrown over the limb of a tree,
and as the man swung upward the
body was pierced by more than 150
bullets. One bullet cut the rope and
the corpse fell to the ground, where
the coroner found it some hours later
when he went to hold an inquest.
Cooper was captured about noon in
a cabin five miles from this
place.
About 2 o'clock this morning Jake Dar-
gan, colored, went to the house of W.
S. Burkett, a white neighbor and said
that Cooper was at his house asleep.
Burkett rode to Sumter with the news
and a deputy sheriff, with a posse of
nine men, immediately left for the
place. A woman and a man were in
the house with Cooper. He sent the
woman out and later sent the man to
buy him ammunition in Camden, giving
him a sample shell. Cooper was
well armed with Winchesters and kept
up a continuous fire. The house was
small and on a hill in the open, so that
the posse could not at first come within
range with any degree of safety. Once
Cooper came out of the house with a
gun and was taking aim, when a Mr.
McCown fired at him. Cooper immediately
dropped his gun and seemed to
be wounded. He did not shoot, but
returned to the house.
Cooper's steady fire kept the crowd
under cover for some time. About
noon, however, an advance was mad.
and the posse closed in. After a parley
Cocper agreed to come out. Sev-
eral nien posted themselves at the door
and as the outlaw stepped out he was
seized by the arms, ard. as he stood
facing the crowd, a shot was fired, and
Coper dropped with a rifle ball
through his cheeks. He was not badly
wounded, however, and, as he rolled
over, made an attempt to get his hand
to his trousers. In his shirt a razor
was found, while beneath his trousers
band was a loaded revolver. Cooper
was drunk, and after the shot became
unmanageable.
A search of the cabin revealed a
Winchester rifle, two revolvers, a valise
filled with cartridges and a number of
flasks, some empty and others filled
with whisky. On a page torn from a
blank book was written:" Remember
that I killed myself; there never was a
man that could take me. Simon Coop-
." Cooper
er was placed in a wagon
with Mr. McKagen, of Sumpter, and
Mr. Tuberville, of Florence, and the
party started for town. The crowd of
nearly 100 men followed. There were
mutterings of lynching, but the trouble
did not culminate until Green Swamp
was reached, about two miles from
Sumpter. Then the mob demanded
Cooper's surrender, the officers were
overpowered and the negro lynched as
related.
The coroner's jury returned a verdict
that Cooper" came to his death at the
hands of a mob, whose are
unknown to the jury." members

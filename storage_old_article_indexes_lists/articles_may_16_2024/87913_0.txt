Augusta, June 28.- After an
all- night run through fields and
forests, with a mob of infuriated
citizens ready to lynch their pris-
oner scouring the country, Deputy
Sheriffs J. L. Garrett and
Charles Blackman arrived at New
port early this morning with Ran
dolph Young, a negro, aged about
25 years, who lives at Augusta and
who was placed in jail at Newport,
where he is held on the charge of
attempting to criminally assault
Miss Ira Edwards, aged about 21
or 22 years, daughter of R. F. Ed
wards, a prominent and well
known farmer, who lives four
miles east of Augusta.
Young, it is alleged, attempted
to assault Miss Edwards at her
home yesterday afternoon. He
was frightened away after a fight
with the girl and arrested shortly
afterward by the two deputies. The
sheriff learned that a lynching party
was waiting for the negro at Au-
gusta and that all roads were
guarded by members of the party

mediately sent the negro to New-
port in charge of his two deputies.
The trip was made across country
and took up the entire night. It
is believed that an attempt may
yet be made to lynch Young, as
the feeling among the citizens of
this place is unusually high
tense. and
A negro, alleged to be Young,
passed the Edwards home about
3 o'clock Saturday afternoon. He
repassed the house shortly after
and stepped into the yard. He
asked Miss Edwards, who was
alone, for a drink of water. She
said that she would get him one,
and, taking a dipper, started for
the well. As she did so the negro
seized her by the arm and shoulder.
She screamed and started to run.
As she did so she fell, pulling the
negro down also. The fall broke
the negro's hold and Miss Ed-
wards sprang up and out the back
door toward field where
starting a
,
her father and brother were work-
ing. Realizing his danger the negro
ran in the opposite direction
and made good a temporary escape.
Sheriff Cain and deputies were
immediately notified and they
started toward the Edwards home.
They met a driver on the road who
told of having met a negro of the
description of one who had at-
tempted to assault Miss Edwards.
The negro was seen by the driver
going towards Augusta and the
officers returned to this city, where
they found and arrested Young.
Then they took him out to the Ed-
wards home, where Miss Edwards
identified him as the negro who
had attacked her. The deputies
started back towards Augusta with
the negro, but Sheriff Cain, who
had gone in advance, to observe
the situation, learned that an
organized
mob was waiting to lynch
negro, and that 200 men had
the surrounded the jail.

Lynching of Murderers at Omaha Is
Narrowly Averted.
Omaha, Neb., Jan. 23.- Enraged to
bitterness by the details of one of the
most cold- blooded murders ever committed
in this state, an armed mob
gathered in front of the jail here to
lynch Jack O'Hearn, Roy Nelson, Leo
Angus and Joe Warran, the self- confessed
slayers of Nels Lausten, a saloon
keeper. A soore of extra officers
were pressed into service by the sheriff
and the chief of police and the order
to shoot to kill in case the
mob given attempted to rush the jail.

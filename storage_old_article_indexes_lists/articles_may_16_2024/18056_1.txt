NEW ORLEAN'S MAFIA SUITS.
The Jury Brings in a Sealed Verdict in
the Abagnatto Case.
New Orleans, La., Dec. 6.- The Abag
natto case against the city of New
Orleans for$ 30,000 damages, a case growing
out of the lynching of the Italian
Mafia, at the Parish prison, in this city
about three years ago, was argued before
Judge Boarman, in the United States
circuit court to- day.
Hon, A. H. Leonard, for the plaintiff,
opened the argument with a brief statement
of the claims of the plaintiff. Both
sides then sent up typewritten instructions
which they desired the court to
give the jury. The court ordered the removal
of the jury from the court room
while the instructions were being dis
cussed
The city denies that it is responsible
for either actual or punitive damage, and
the plaintiff contends the reverse.
The plaintiff to- day submitted that the
actual damages based on the earning capacity
of the deceased during the time he
would probably have lived, if he had not
been killed, would have amounted to
$ 10,000.
A VERDICT REACHED IN AN HOUR.
The case was given to the jury quite
late, and soon thereafter the court adjourned
until 11 o'clock a. m. to- morrow.
The jury had been out about an hour
when a verdict was agreed upon, but the
court having adjourned the jury delivered
a sealed verdict into the hands of the
clerk, and it will not be opened until 11
o'clock to- morrow.
Judge Boarman virtually decided that
Abagnatto was an Italian citizen and
that damages should be given for the
suffering of the prisoner during the at
tack on the prison, and the lynching. It
is thought that the jury gave a verdict
against the city for several thousand dollars
, although the plaintiff asked for$ 30
00.,

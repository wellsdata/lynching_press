POINT FOR DEFENSE.
Case of the Lynchers Is Nearly Ready
for the Jury.
Charlotte, N. C., July 22.- The defense
in the case of Zeke Lewis, who
with lynching John V.
is charged
Johnson at Wadesboro last summer,
scored a signal point today in the introduction
of evidence pointing to the
fact that Battle Lewis, brother of the
defendant, and not Zeke, was the ringleader
of the mob that lynched John-
son. Battle Lewis is one of the three
alleged lynchers who fled the state
after the grand jury returned indictments
.
The state concluded its testimony
before the noon recess today and the
defense immediately began the introduction
of testimony. Practically the
same witnesses that testified in the
Jones case were put on by the state
and no new evidence was developed
on either side beyond the alibi for the
defendant, Lewis. Nearly all of the
witnesses for the defense admitted
either relationship to some of the
under indictment or of having
men contributed to the defense fund.

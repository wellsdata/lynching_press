The press agent of the mob that hanged Leo Frank hastens
to deny that the body was mutilated or that there was any intention
to mutilate it. We are given to understand that the
mob's dignified and orderly aim merely was to carry out the
order of the court which had condemned Frank to death, and
that it was not overriding the law, but the governor's order.
There are many who will accept this as a squaring up of the
mob's course with the law of God all and man.

MURDERER LYNCHED.
White Man Pursued by an Arkansas
Mob and Hanged.
DERMOTT, Ark., Oct. 17.- A lynching in
which the victim was a white man named
Cole occurred near Wilmot early Friday
morning. Cole had committed a cold- blooded
murder and was pursued, captured and
strung up by a posse composed of the murdered
man's friends. Cole was of unsavory
reputation and a habitual loafer. He was
arrested on Wednesday by Constable James
Jones on the charge of having committed
some slight misdemeanor. When taken before
a justice of the peace Cole was placed
under bond, which he succeeded in giving
and was released. As he walked out of
court he muttered a threat against the con-
saying that he was be-
stable,
ing unjustly persecuted and would
even with the officer. Later
get
Cole secured a double- barreled shotgun
and, slipping up behind Jones, fired both
barrels into the constable's back, killing
him instantly. In the excitement Cole made
his escape, but a large posse was soon organized
and started in pursuit. Bloodhounds
were secured and the search for
Cole was continued until early Friday
morning, when he was found in the woods
eight miles from Wilmot. The mob made
quick work of him. A rope was tied about
his neck and he was swung up without ceremony
. The mob returned to Wilmot, leaving
the body of Cole swinging to a tree.
Jones was an old officer and stood high
the community. in

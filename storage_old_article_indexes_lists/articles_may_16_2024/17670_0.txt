Memphis, July 25.- A special from
Little Rock, Ark., says Osceola, county
seat of Mississippi county, is practically
in a state of insurrection on account
of Governor Davis having revoked
the commissions of Sheriff Bow
en and Circuit Clerk Driver. Bowen
and Driver have taken possession of
the courthouse, supported by a crowd
of determined followers, and refuse to
vacate. Practically the whole town is
under Rhodes and Lovewall
arms.,
appointed to succeed Bowen and Driv
, have a following of several thou
sand and though an actual clash
has thus far been avoided one is momentarily
expected. An appeal is to
be made to Governor Davis to put
county under martial law. th
The lynching of a negro last Friday
near Osceola, after he had been taken
from one Sheriff Bowen's deputies,
has added of to the excitement.

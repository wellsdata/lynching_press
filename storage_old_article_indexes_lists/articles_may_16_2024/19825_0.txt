BY ASSOCIATED PRESS.
Milledgeville, Ga., July 24.- Wil
liam Creen stabbed Leo M. Frank in
the prison here last Saturday night
because he feared the prison would
be attacked by a mob bent on lynching
Frank, he told Governor Harris
today. The governor came here with
a committee of the legislature- to investigate
prison conditions and to get
Creen's statement as Frank's assail
ant had said he would tell his story
only to the governor and B. H. Har
ady of Macon. Harady has not been
in Georgia since the attack.
Creen said he alone planned the at
tack several days before it took place
but said nothing to anyone about it.
He said the knife he used was not the
one he used when killing hogs that
Saturday as reported, but that he had
stolen the weapon from the kitchen
Friday before the attack. He hid it
in his bunk, he told the governor.
" I felt that as long as he( Frank)
was here there was danger of
prison being attacked," Creen said the.

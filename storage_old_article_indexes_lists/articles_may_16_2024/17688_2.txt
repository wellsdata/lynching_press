Lynched For Derailing a Train
Near Dunellon.
The Negro, Norman McKinney, Implicates Two
Others Who Are Being Hunted and
May Share His Fate.
( By the Associated Press.)
Ocala, Fla .. an. 16.- Norman McKin
ney, colored, has been lynched for
wrecking the Plant System fast train
near Dunnellon Sunday night and the
victim implicated two others who may
share the same fate if they are caught.
In less than two hours after the wreck
in which the engineer was killed, the
Citrus County officers were on the trail
of the wreckers and a dozen arrests
were made before Monday at noon. All
of the arrests were on suspicion and
several of them were liberated, proving
conclusive that they were not the
guilty parties. Monday afternoon Mc-
Kinney seemed to be taking a deep
interest in the affair and was promptly
arrested by the officers also on suspl-
eion. That night he was questioned so
closely and told so many conflicting
stories that it was decided to carry him
to Inverness to the county jail.
On the way a mob of 50 or more over
powered the officers and took the prisoner
. He was taken back to the scene
of the wreck and there confessed to the
crime, implicating and describing the
two others who have escaped, but are
now being inted. After the confes-
sion, in which he stated that the train
was wrecked for the purpose of robbery
, he was hanged to a tree. The
coroner's jury returned the verdict that
met death at the hands of parties
unknown he.

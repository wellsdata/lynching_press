Jury Hits
By Indictments Mobs
RETURNED FOR ELEVEN
SECRET INDICTMENTS
St. Joseph, Mo., Jan. 3.- The Bu-
chanan County grand jury last Fri-
day returned eleven secret indictments
in connection with the lynching
here recently of Lloyd Warner, 19-
year- old youth accused of having attacked
a young woman.
The grand jury composed of a group
of representative white citizens
a statement which read: issued
" In the lynching of Lloyd Warner
we wish to state that our act should
not be taken as final in closing the
investigation of this inhuman orgy,
but we feel that only a beginning has
been made which should be pursued
further by the law enforcement agencies
of the state and county, and
wherever the facts would justify other
arrests and prosecutions than those
already in progress, we earnestly suggest
that guilty parties speedily
brought to justice." be

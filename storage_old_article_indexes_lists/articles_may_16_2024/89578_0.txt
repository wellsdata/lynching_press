A Mississippi Murderer Lynched.
Ben Pierce, a well- to- do farmer of
Battlefield, Neosho County, Miss., was
brutally murdered by John Bull, an
Indian. Bull entered Pierce's house
and cut his throat from ear to ear.
Death resulted instantly. Justice was
meted out to the Indian that evening by
his neighbors, who swung him from a
of the nearest tree. No cause as
limb signed for the murder.

THE CHEROKEE NATION. The National Council
met on the 2d instant, and on the 3d instant, in joint
ballot, elected judges and solicitors for the rospective
districts. On the 4th, the acting principal chief,
George Lowrey, sent in a message, brief and business
like. It acknowledges, in fitting and grateful language
, the Divine goodness as shown to the Chero-
kee nation the abundance of the and the in-
, crops,
creasing industry and general prosperity of the people
; regrets the killing of the notorious Starr boys,
and says that they ought to have been tried by jury,
and strongly deprecates the system of Lynch law;
lays the blame of such local disturbances as have occurred
upon the use of intoxicating drinks; says the
mission to Washington, on the affairs of the nation,
had been attended with no certain results; and ex-
the Council in its deliberations to be influenced
horts only by patriotism.

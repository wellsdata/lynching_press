An Outlaw Saved from a Mob.
CINCINNATI, July 22.- A mob of armed men
rode into Sandy Hook, Ky., in the night and took Clay
Mobry, an outlaw, from jail, and carried him to a tree,
where a mob had previously hanged two men. They
were preparing to swing him, but his yells and piteous
screams brought the people off out and he was saved.

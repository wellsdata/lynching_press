There is no reason to despair over the
reign of the lynchers in the South when
a man is convicted by an Alabama jury
of murder in the first degree for being
a member of a mob that lynched a
man, and the court sentences him to
life imprisonment. And the man
lynched was a negro and the man convicted
was a man. Surely the
world does not white go backwards.

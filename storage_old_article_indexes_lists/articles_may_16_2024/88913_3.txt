ten
stabbed a young man in the back because
he changed his telephone ring in
some way not to Mr. Richards' liking.
They arrested Richards and took him
to Bedford. Some of the neighbors
wanted to lynch Richards last night,
but some of the older ones prevailed on
the crowd to let him go to jail. The
boy was badly cut across the face and
neck and across his breast, probably
not fatally but very badly. Richards
had only a, jack knife.

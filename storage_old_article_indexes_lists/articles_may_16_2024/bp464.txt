HOW TO RESTRAIN THE
NEGRO CRIMINAL
Governor Huey Long, in his re-
cent interview given to the Edi-
tor cf the Crisis, adroitly side-
steps the issue of lynching but
glozes over this horrible lynching
at Franklinton. Louisiana, with
the remark that the Negro was
"guilty as hell." Mob violence op-
erates with equal atrocity whether
the victim be innocent or guilty.
Senator Long contends that it
the
would be useless for him. as Dic-
tarer of Louisiana, to pursue this
tragic instance any further, be-
cause it would only result in
lynching of hundreds of other Ne-
grees. The guilt or innocence of
a lynched Negro is never after-
wards judicially determined. In
cases of conflict between the races.

ed that the white man is the ag-
gressor. The over-awed and
timidated Negro would hardly as-
sault a white man unless goaded
on beyond the point of human en-
durance. The burden of guilt is
always imposed upon the weaker
vessel. The wolf abore always
blames the lamb for muddying the
water below.

criminal tendency is more glaring
in the North where the courts are
presumably fair than in the
South. The criminal record of the
Negro is a standing menace to the
community for which white and
blark are alike responsible. The
Negro is suppressed below the ler-
el of decent human existence and
reduced to a status where vice and
crime breed and fester. For this
the whites are chiefly responsible,
for they control the industrial, po-
litical and social machinery which
keeps the Negro in a status c
comparative ignorance and poverty
-the feeding ground of vice ana
crime. The whites are also
control of the Government and of
the courts of law and thus it be-
comes their bounding duty to en-
courage all the people along the
lines of good citizenship. The Ne
To has no governmental or con-
stituted authority over his own
race. It is only the bond of blood
and ties of sympathy that actuate
him to voluntary advice and coun-
sel of good behavior. Upon the
Negro teacher, preacher, editcr
and general leader, devolves 1
heavy, though a voluntary respor-
sibility. Those who assume Gor-
ernmental authority cannot throw
their whole responsibility upon
Negro leadership, deprived of pow-

which confronted the Jew under
Roman over-lordship when Jesus
uttered His Sermon on the Mount.
His advice to His Hebrew fellow-
sufferers was based on practical
prudence and
salutary
cau-
tion."Agree with thine adversary
quickly while thou art in the way
with him. If thine enemy compl
thee to go with him one mile, go
with him twain, if he takes away
thy coat let him have thy cloak
also." Unless the Hebrew peasant
thus conduct himself, at the be-
hest of the Roman Officer, he
would deliver him to the Judge who
would cast him into prison, front e
which he would not be released
Â¦ until he had paid his utmost farth-
ing. Te Negro in the South, out
of a self-protecting caution, had
better agree quickly with an offi-
cer of the law when he is in the
way with him. else he runs the
risk, not only of being cast into
prison, but lynched on the nearest
lamp post, after
there is no recourse.

The whites who hold all power
in their hands, should use every
kindly endeavor to persuade anu
convince the Negro of the benefi-
cent purpose and function of the
law, that it is calculated to pro-
tect and safeguard their interest
and wellbeing, and not merely as a
means of humiliating and degrad-
ing them. Too often the police-
mens club is the only instrument
of the law with which the Negro
comes into contact. This engen-
ders in him a disirust and resent-
ful attitude toward all public au-
thorities and law officers. None
can doubt that such a kindly at-
titude would go far to convince
the Negro of the value to himself
and advantage of law obedience
and good citizenship.
On the other hand those Ne-
groes who stand in high places of
intellectual, morril and spiritual
leadership and authority among
their own race, shoud never cease
to inculcate practical wisdom of
observance of, and obedience to
the law and constituted social
authorities. They that sin with-
out the law, shall perish without
the alw. Too often, alas, Negrocs
who may or may not sin against
the law. are condignly punished
withcut the law.
Lynching is the acme of all j
villainy. It is the common duty
f white and black alike to unite !
in a common endeavor to stamp
cut this evil which is gnawing at
the vitals of the Nation,

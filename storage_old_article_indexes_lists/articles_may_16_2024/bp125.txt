was on duty the night of the
incident and initially told
officers that the men over-
powered him in the jail.
The men, dressed in white
robes and hoods similar to
those worn by Ku Klux
Klansmen, allegedly took
Jackson from his cell into a
hallway of the jail. Jackson
had been arrested by Plamp-
kin Saturday on a disorder-

and allegedly resisted arrest.
THE HOODED men alleg-
edly told the youth that he
was a "troublemaker" and
would be punished if he ever
gave a policeman trouble a-
gain. After being slapped
two or three times Jackson
was returned to his cell.

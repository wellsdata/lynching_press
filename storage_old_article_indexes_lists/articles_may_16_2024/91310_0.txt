NORTHERN CHARITY .-- A Ku Klux committee is
greatly needed in the town of Cadiz, Ohio. A
young man stopping at a hotel there was taken with
the small- pox, whereupon some of the citizens entered
his room, sewed him up in a blanket, and took
him out through a back window, after which they
placed him in a wagon and drew him to an old deserted
house without roof or windows. Here they
left him to the care of a negro, the rain pouring
down on him the while. Of course the poor fellow
died, and while his body was being thrust into a
hole dug in an open field, some of the neighbors
stood on the hills and shot at the men engaged in
the proceeding. The negro nurse was then given
his choice either to leave town or be shot; and so
the people got rid of the man who was apparently
the most decent inhabitant of the place.- Witming-

Yes, the people who permitted such inhuman
conduct now rolling their eyes in holy horror
at reported are Southern outrages!

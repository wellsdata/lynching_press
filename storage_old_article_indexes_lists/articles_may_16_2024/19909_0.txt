Sinful Siftings.
A crowd of 100 armed men went to the
house of Mr. W. Slaughter, about four
miles north of Smith lake in the town of
Middleville and demanded of him that
,
he should leave the country. A written
notice was served on Slaughter stating
that his family had become annoying to
respectable citizens, and that they had
determined to apply lynch law in case the
family did not dissappear. The Slaughters
, parents, sons and daughters are
said to be a hard crowd.,

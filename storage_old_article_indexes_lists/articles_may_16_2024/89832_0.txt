" SUNSHINE"
By Mrs. Nellie Maye Taylor
Hello there, here and everywhere
. Oh! how I hate to get up
in the morning. These mornings
are so nice and cool, it is brutal,
it's murder it is a crime to be
awaken from a snoozy peaceful
slumber and have to get out in
the heat on an old job. Don't you
think so? Did you hear the President's
great speech at the thirty-
eighth National Convention of the
N. A. A. C. P. His words were
broadcast to the Nation over the
four major networks and to all
other countries by short wave especially
arranged by the State
Dept. The President condemned
racial prejudice and discrimination
and pledged that the federal government
" would show the way" to
backward states and communities
which fail to safeguard the rights
of all Americans. And he went on
to say a whole big lot of good
things, it sounded mighty good, and
I believe he is sincere. If he isn't
I believe he is any way. Because
it took a lot of grit and guts to
stand before the world and repeat
all of those good things for a Minority
group. It is a wonder he
isn't called a Communist. Most
people who speak in our behalf, are
called N- lovers or Communists.
They tell me only four Countries
of any size that do not Discriminate
against the Negro. They are
Old Mexico, Russia, Canada and
France. Where in our home land
can we go, feel free and enjoy ourselves
without Discrimination. Discrimination
hangs over us like a
shroud, a shroud in dreary black.
And it is never shed until our body
goes back to mother dust,( in a
jim crow grave- yard) and our souls
to the God that giveth( in a jim
crow Church). Many noted and
common Negroes have been known
to die, for the lack of medical aid
or admission to a hospital. Because
of discrimination. Did you read
where another Negro was lynched
in Ga., yes for the same thing,
raping a white woman, well he
wasen't exactly lynched, he was
electricuted. Poor fellow he didn't
have a half a chance down there,
as thousands of others, who were
unfortunate enough to have been
born there. Well there is nothing
we can say about out here to boast
about. There are only two or three
places down town, where we can
go and be served, to a refreshing
drink or a tasty sandwich. And at
the shows you are sure to sit in
the balcolony. I was told things
only got that way when all of
these Olka. cotton pickers came
out here. They are supposed to
have ruined things in this
valley of the sun. However I lovely have
noticed, no Negroes live out on
Palm Lane, and I am sure there
are some here who can afford it.
No Negroes are employed at Camel
Back Inn. Negroes have never been
allowed at W. H. hotel only to
work. If my husband would like to
take me out to dine and dance, I
wouldn't be welcome at any of the
fine exclusive Clubs. And if your
husband should like to take me
out to a nice quiet nook, just
where would we go. Do you dig
me? Now if the Oklahoma Cotton|
pickers are responsible for all of
this Discrimination in this lovely
city may they all go back to Okla.
and stay there. But I don't believe
that do you? If that be true there
are Okie Cotton pickers everywhere
. Discrimination is like
slavery let us hope and pray that
it will be abolished some day
Bye Now So long-' til then..

FIVE NEGROES LYNCHED.
Near Greenville, Ala., an Angry Mob Hangs
the Supposed Murderers of a White
Man.
MONTGOMERY, Ala., April 22.- A man
who arrived at 9 o'clock last night
from Greenville, Ala., 40 miles south of
here reports that five negroes were
lynched near there Saturday night.
Just before his train left Greenville
the sheriff of the county came into
town and reported that in passing
Buckalow plantation, 3 miles from
town, he had found the five negroes,
three men and two women hanging
,
by their necks to some trees, their
bodies cold, evidently having been
dead for some hours.
Saturday night news reached Green-
ville of the brutal murder, near Butler
, in that county, of Watts Murphy,
a popular young white man, by the
negroes. Murphy was a prominent
young farmer, being a nephew of the
late Gov. Watts, of this city. After
murdering him the negroes placed his
body in a brush heap and burned
the heap. The debris was examined
and the teeth, liver and
heart of the victim were found.
The balance of the body had been con-
sumed. An investigation was instituted
. Three negroes were arrested.
Finally yesterday one of the negroes
gave way and confessed the crime, implicating
two other negro men and
two women. The officers secured and
were closely guarding the prisoners
when last heard of Saturday night.
The report last night does not give the
details of how the mob secured the
murderers, except that they were taken
by force. A telegram from
confirms the story. Greenville

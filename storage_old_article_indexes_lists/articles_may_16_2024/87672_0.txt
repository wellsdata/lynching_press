Ohio was disgraced last week by a
negro lynching that would have put
the South shame
most sections of to.
The victim committed a fiendish crime,
was given a hurried trial and sentenced
to twenty years' imprisonment. Even
this did not satisfy the public demand
and before he could be committed to
the penitentiary the jail was besieged
by an angry mob. A militia company
was called out to protect the prisoner
and fired into the crowd, killing three
and wounding several. Resistance
was then abandoned, the mob gained
an entrance to the jail and the negro
was quickly hung to the nearest tree.
All this took place in broad daylight, in
to
the small town of Urbana, not far from
Columbus. It is said that many of the
leading citizens of the place participated
. We have often maintained that,
given the same provocation, the white
people of the North would indulge in
negro lynching as freely as the white
people of the South. There is something
in the nameless crime frequently
perpetrated by black fiends on respectable
white women that stirs many
men's passions beyond all control. It
is more revolting than murder. The
law does not provide adequate punishment
, which would be nothing short of
hanging. When the offense is especially
loathsome the people take the law
into their own hands and make a punishment
that fits the crime. We do not
defend such actions. The law should
be kept paramount. But nobody
tell just what he would do under like can
provocation. Without doubt the citizens
of Urbana are ordinarily as peaceable
and order- loving as those of any
Vermont town. The remedy would
seem to be to add one more crime to
list punishable by death, according
the to the nature of the offense.

SAVED BY STEEL DOORS
A BRUTAL MURDERER
The Futile Effort of a Los Animas, Gol
Mob to Hold a Lynching.
The Butchery of a Farmer by a Tramp Who After-
Iward Boasted That He
His Victim.
Las Animas, Dec. 26- After several
hours of diligent effort at storming
the county jail here, a mob which
gathered after dark for the purpose of
lynching Lawrence Leberg, a tramp
who yesterday brutally murdered Henry
Lavenmeyer, a prominent farmer,
it is not thought there will be any further
attempt to carry out the plans of
vengeance. The mob worked its way
into the jail as far as the steel doors
by breaking down the wooden doors,
but was met with a stern refusal by
the jail keepers to turn over the prisoner
.
Leberg's crime was the work of a
fiend.
Alighting from a Santa Fe
freight train yesterday afternoon at
Robinson station, near this city, he
crossed the river, and secured a meal
from a farmer named George Purvis
.
He set fire to a hay stack belonging
to Hey Lavenmeyer who took Leberg.
into custody, allowing him to ride behind
him on a horse. Lavenmeyer dismounted
to open a gate. Leberg killed
him with a hammer, which he found
tied to Lavenmeyer's saddle.
Leberg left his victim lying on the
road, returned soon after and with a
pocket knife cut Lavenmeyer's throat
from ear to ear and attempted to scalp
him. Neighbors found the body and
posse was formed. Leberg was caught
riding Lavenmeyer's horse. He submitted
to arrase quietly, and boasted of
his crime, saying the he had drunk the
blood of his victim. Leberg was
brought here and lodged in jail.
At noon today Sheriff Brown started
for Pueblo with his prisoner
better protection but was met by for
crowd of three hundred people who
protested against Leberg's removal,
and he was again placed in jail here.
Soon after dark several hundred. men
and boys appeared at the jail, but were
refused admittance. Almost immediately
they began an attack on the jail.

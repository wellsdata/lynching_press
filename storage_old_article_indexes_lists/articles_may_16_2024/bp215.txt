Ga. Attorney
General Against
Anti-Lynch Law
ATLANTA, Ga.—(ANP)—Attor-
ney General Eugene Cook last
week cited the Walton county
lynching of four Negroes as proof
of the federal government's in-
effectiveness in dealing with lynch-
ing as he went on record as op-
posing the Case anti-lynching bill
at an Emory University law school
assemblage.
Cook particularly opposes the
section of the measure which
would fine the state if a lynching
occurred. Cook views that the
various states would punish any
lynchers if they could find them.
The attorney general insists that
the federal government would
usurp state duties under the pro-
posed anti-lynching bill.
U. S. INEFFECTIVE
In the Walton county lynching,
Cook noted that the federal gov-
ernment with all of its powers had,
been ineffective in clearing up the
case. Federal legislation would
take over state police powers and
prosecute any private citizen for
failing to prevent mob action since
any citizen of Georgia had au-
thority to apprehend any person
seen committing a felony, Cook
contended.
He also said Georgia already has
laws to require police to prevent
lynchings and that federal laws
can do no more.
Through all his address, the at-
torney general failed to point out
just how seriously the Georgia
Bureau of Investigation and local
police went into the Monroe lynch-
ings.

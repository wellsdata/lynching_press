QUIET AT MIDNIGHT.
Springfield. Mo., April 15.- At midnight
the militia had cleared the
public square of all people and are
sleeping around the tower where
the three negroes were lynched
lynched last night. Other squads of
militia, are parading the negro dis-
âœ¦tricts. The streets otherwise are
deserted. There is a feeling now
that the trouble over. Tonight
a reaction set in and most people
condemn the action of the mob.
The authorities tonight assert that
Copeland and Duncan, two of the
victims, were innocent This is the
general belief..

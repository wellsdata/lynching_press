ESCAPE FROM MOB.
White Man Who Shot His Former Wife
Is Jailed.
Memphis, April 20.- A speedy run to
Bartlett, Tenn., 10 miles from Memphis,
by Sheriff Monteverde and several deputies
in an automobile and another quick
trip back to this city with Hardiman F.
Deeson, who shot and probably fatally
wounded his former wife, Bessie Ellis
Deeson, today put an end to a demonstration
which for a time threatened to develop
into a lynching. The shooting of
Mrs. Deeson occurred at her home at
Bartlett, and was a sequel to domestic
troubles of a year ago, which at the time
brought about a shooting affray in which
the man was shot and seriously wounded
by the woman after he had fired a fusillade
at the house in which she had taken
quarters. Some months ago Mrs. Deeson
I was granted a divorce.
According to the statement of the woman
she was accosted by Deeson today as
she was entering a barn early in the
morning, the man announcing that he intended
taking her life. When she started
to run Deeson opened fire, each of the
three bullets fired taking effect. Deeson
escaped, but was soon captured. Crowds
began to gather, and when the sheriff's
posse arrived they found a small- sized
mob clamoring for an instant hanging,
and apparently only awaiting a leader to
attempt the carrying out of their threat.
Deeson was quickly secured, and was
finally landed safely in the county jail
here. He refuses to make any statement
as to the shooting.
Mrs. Deeson is the daughter of a well-
known contractor of this city, and the
man is the son of a prominent
of Lake Providence, La. planter

Brookhaven, Miss., Dec. 11.- Additional
dictails of the murder of Mrs. Brown
Smith and her four children in Lawrence
county, about twenty- four miles west of
here, last Monday, and the subsequent
lynching of the murderer, were received
here today.
After capturing Charlie Lewis, the alleged
murderer, the mob placed him
talongside the cither negroes and asked
the title girl who was spared by the
murderer, to pick out the one who killed
her micitihier. She at once pointed to
Charles Lewis. This strong evidence to
the mob made it difficult for Sheriff Gas-
sel, of Monticello, to induce the people
Jo turn Lewis over to him for safe keep-
dinig. He assured them he would produce
the at Bankston at 10 o'clock for
trial negro. 1

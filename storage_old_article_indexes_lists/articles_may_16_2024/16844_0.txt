The Mob at Washington.
Our readers have seen, in our Telegraphic
Despatches, as well as elsewhere, notices of the
proceedings of a tolerably numerous Mob, in
Washington who took themselves to con-
, upon
nect the National Era newspaper of that city
with the absconding of some seventy slaves, a
few days ago, and to threaten its proprietors
with the judgment and execution of a Law that
is widely in vogue among the" chivalry" of
the South, and is known as" Lynch law," un-
they should think proper to remove their
less establishment from the District of Columbia.

June 13.- News
Meridian, Miss ..
reached here tonight of the murder of
five negroes in the extreme northwestern
portion of Kemper county.
A negro man named Sibley, while
crazy drunk on" blind tiger" whisky,
secured a gun and started out to kill
person he met. The first he
every
came across happened to be five ne-
groes, three women and two- children,
and the fiend shot them down and left
them dead where they fell. He also
shot at six other negroes, who narrowly
escaped. As soon as the bloody
work of Sibley was discovered, the most
intense excitement prevailed, and a
mob was organized to lynch the murderer
. Sibley took to the woods, carrying
his shot gun with him, and at last
accounts the mob had surrounded him
Word comes from DeKalb that the
sheriff of Kemper has gone to
the scene with a large county posse.

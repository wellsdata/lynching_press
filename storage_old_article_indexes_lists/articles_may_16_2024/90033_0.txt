As It Was.
ZIONSVILLE, Nov. 15.- Special.- The
report sent out from Lebanon that a
lynching mob was forming here last night
is a lie. Wednesday night an irate party
of citizens called on Mrs. White, to whom
Conrad had been paying attentions, and
informed her that she must leave the
town at once or her house would be blown
up with dynamite. Thursday morning
she is reported to have been missing and
it is presumed that she has fled.
The White woman and Motts had had
an argument over the payment of a gas
bill and Motts had called at her house a
time or two. This made Conrad jealous
and he shot on sight. Motts's condition
is very Motts precarious.

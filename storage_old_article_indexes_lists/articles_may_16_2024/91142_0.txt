West Chester, Pa., March 14.-
A severe blow was struck at the
traffic in Chester County
this morning when Judge Hemp-
hill and Butler, after a conference,
unexpectedly handed down a joint
opinion revoking all licenses of
of hotels in Coatesville, Pa. They
also refuse one- half those in Phoe-
nixville and West Chester, and the
one in Valley Forge. Notice
only was served at once by the court
officers upon the proprietors of all
the hotels involved, and the bars
were closed for at least a year.
The lynching of Walker, a colored
man, at Coatesville, in August,
1911, is said to be responsible for
the judges' action
Coatesville. concerning

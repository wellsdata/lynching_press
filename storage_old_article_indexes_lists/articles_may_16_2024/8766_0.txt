TWO NEGROES LYNCHED.
Murderers of a Missouri
Constable
Hanged by a Mob.
Clarksville, Mo., June 6.- An excursion
boat from Louisiana, Hannibal and
Quincy reached here
yesterday with
about 200 negroes aboard. Scarcely had
they arrived when there was a disturbance
, and City Marshal Walter McLean
I was called. He boarded the boat, and
was about to make an arrest, when he
was grasped by one of the drunken ne-
groes in front, while another from behind
shot him in the head, killing him
almost instantly. The men
paraded the
streets all day, flourishing guns, rifles,
and revolvers.
Four of the negroes were arrested and
Sam and Curtis Young, the two who murdered
Marshal McLean, of Clarkesville,
were taken from the officers early this
morning by a mob and hanged to
tree a mile north of the city. a

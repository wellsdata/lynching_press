Texas and Pacific rallroad, shot him
killing him instantly, and
down, fatally
wounding his two sons, 14 and 13

years of age. Botto was
at but escaped and gave the alarm.
While she was gone they robbed the
place and escaped. Two armed negroes
were arrested at Port Allen tonight, and
a committee sent to secure them. If they
prove they are the right parties they
will be lynched by morning, as the county
is aroused and up in arms. The negroes
were big, burly fellows and came to the
settlement with avowed intention of
robbing the railroad the depot.

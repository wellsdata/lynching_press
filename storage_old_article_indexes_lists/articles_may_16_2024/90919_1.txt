it. They know that national control
would not stop lynching and
mobbing. The remedy is not for
one part of the people to control
another part, but for the people
everywhere to control themselves.
And the colored people have their
and the
part in this work. They must
learn the lesson of toleration and
respect for law as well as the
whites, though they are not so
much to be blamed as the whites,
from whom they learned mobbing
and lynching. Unless this is done
American civilization will become
a byword and a reproach throughout
the world. This feature of our
existence is not civilization. It is
barbarism of the worst type, no
matter in what cause it may be exercised

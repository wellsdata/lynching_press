at
Penalty Inflicted by Members of
Their Own Race.
HOUSTON, Tex., April 30.- For three mur-
W.
ders and burning down the humble home of
their victims, six- perhaps seven- negroes
last night suffered the death penalty at the
hands of a mob of their own race. Last night
12 o'clock a mob of negroes took from a
room at Sunnyside, Tex., where they were
being guarded, Fayette Rhone, aged twenty-
one; Will Gates, thirty- five; Lewis Thomas,
twenty; Aaron Thomas, thirteen; Jim Thom-
, fourteen; Benny Thomas, fifteen, the
four latter being brothers, and Will Williams,
all negroes, and hanged the first six named
an oak tree. The seventh was hanged, but
has disappeared. Several shots were heard
shortly after the mob took them from the
room, and he may have tried to escape. The
negroes all confessed to having murdered
Henry Daniels, an old negro, his stepdaughter
and a seven- year- old child, burning the
bodies of the two oldest by setting fire to
the cabin where the crime occurred and
throwing the little one's body intb a well.
Old man Daniels had the proceeds of a robbery
which the Thomas boys had committed
and they demanded it of him under pain of
death

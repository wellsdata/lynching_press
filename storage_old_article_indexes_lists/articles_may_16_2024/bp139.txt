Reports Fear, Guilt
Dominate Poplarville
The white population of Poplarville, Miss., is "wrenched by
conflict betwen dread and guilt" over the lynching of Negro Mack
Parker, a magazine editor declared this week.
Writing in the current issue of
Look Magazine, Georgia-born ed-|
itor George Leonard, Jr. said he!
found during a recent visit to
Poplarville that people
"trying desperately to force the
ugly matter from their conscious
minds."
were
(Editor's Note: А federal
grand jury was impaneled Mon-
day in Bilozi, Miss. to hear evi-
dence that a deputy sheriff, a
former deputy sheriff and an or-
dained minister took part in the
Parker lynching last spring.)
"The people of
Poplarville
were obviously trying to fool
themselves. Some of the less ed-
ucated already has woven a web
of fantasy to protect them from
their own feelings," Leonard
wrote.
NAACP Frame-Up
He said he was told by one
man that “most people" in Pop-
larville think that the Parker
case was "a frame-up by the
NAACP" and that "there wasn't.
no rape and there wasn't no;
lynching."

The Parker case made interna.
tional headlines last April when
Parker was dragged from a Pop.
larville jail by a band of masked
men two days before he was to
go on trial for raping a pregnant
white women. Nine days later,
his bullet-ridden boy was recov-
cred from the Pearl River.
Leonard said in Look that he
was told by a Southern newspa.¡
perman that the local attitude
supporting the lynching was far
more general when the story
broke than most of the local
leaders are now willing to admit.

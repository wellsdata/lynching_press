Angry Mob Lynches White
Rayville, La., July 10.- Aroused by the
fact that an appeal to the supreme court
had been taken, following his condemnation
to death here Friday on the charge
of having murdered Town Marshal C. C.
Chenault, a mob battered down the doors
of the parish jail at Rayville today and,
dragging J. D. Freeman, a white man,
from his cell, hanged him on the same
spot where he had slain the marshal.
The fact that a deep gash was found in
Freeman's throat led to the theory
he attempted suicide, probably with that a
piece of glass, when he heard the mob's
approach.
The lynching occurred shortly after 2
o'clock this morning. Late Saturday afternoon
an appeal to the supreme court
in Freeman's behalf had been granted.
" This is the outcome of the appeal," was
the note found pinned to the dead man's
clothing.
Freeman, who was a blacksmith, shot
and killed Chenault three weeks ago when
the latter attempted to arrest him for
a minor offense. The officer was one
of the most popular residents of this
community and feeling against his
was intense. slayer

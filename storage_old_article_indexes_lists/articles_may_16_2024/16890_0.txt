LYNCH LAW IN ARKANSAS. The overseer
of Col. Walworth, a rich planter of Chicot
county, Ark. was murdered about a year ago,
by one of his slaves, who was tried and convicted
of the offence, but subsequently obtained a
new trial. The populace, fearing he would
thus escape punishment, took the law into their
own hands, and on the 4th inst. a mob repaired
to the jail, cut down the door, notwsthstanding
the remonstrance and resistance of the sheriff,
entered the prison and forcibly took the prisoner
, led him forth with a halter round his neck,
in cold blood hung him to a tree within 100
yards and of the jail.

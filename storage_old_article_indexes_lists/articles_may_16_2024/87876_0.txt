A negro has been lynched in Lit-
tle River county. It is stated that
he confessed to the murder of a
prominent planter and it may be
true that he was guilty. The men
who took the law into their own
hands will feel licensed to do so
again should a crime of any kind be
committed in their vicinity, and after
while they will want to urob
anyone who happens to incur their
displeasure. Thus the evil effects
of mob violence is made apparent
and the ever- increasing tendency to
discredit our legal institutions is a
for consideration
subject grave,
Why has the legislature neglected a
matter of so much importance to
the people? It is not too late even
to enact a law that would les
now sen mob violence.- Ark. Democrat,

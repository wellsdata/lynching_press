Armed and determined
men are
searching the Dans mountains for the
assailant of pretty Eva Lowrey, aged
14 years, who was brutally maltreated
in her home late yesterday afternoon,
by a negro. The men armed as soon
as the crime was known, with clubs,
revolvers, shotguns and
carrying
ropes. A systematic search was
continued
all night, despite the heavy
downpour of rain.
When daylight
came the men continued the search
with renewed vigor and they threaten
a lynching if the negro is captured

Noah Hendley sent a posse
of deputies out after the
negro, but
the reports the sheriff received this
morning indicate that if the men are
successful in their quest, his deputies
will have difficulty in preventing
mary action. sum-

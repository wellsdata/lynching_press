A serious conflict between negro
mill hands and strikers occurred at
Homestead, Pa., on the 14th. The
strikers attacked the negroes who
drew revolvers and opened fire on their
assailants. Several
persons were
wounded by bullets and missiles. Some
500 persons engaged in the riot and
the negroes narrowly escaped lynching
. This outbreak shows the serious
condition of affairs at Homestead, and
the necessity for a renewal of
surveillance. military

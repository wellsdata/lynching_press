Lynch Law Applied to a Negro.
BALTIMORE, Nov. 3.
The American has a letter from Dutton, in
Caroline county, in this State, giving an account
of the lynching of a negro under arrest
for the outrage and murder of a little girl,
daughter of Edgar Plummer. On Saturday
night a large number of excited people came
into the town, surrounded the jail, forced open
the doors and took the prisoner and hung him.
While suspended fifteen bullets perforated his
body. He was then cut down and his throat
cut by the infuriated mob. The body was
dragged through the streets and finally taken
to the front of the church, where it was cut
pieces and burnt. to

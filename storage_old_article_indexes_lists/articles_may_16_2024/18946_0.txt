THIS IS SAD.
A Suggestion to Northern Republicans Who
Defeated the Force Bill.
CHARLESTON, May 25.- Further particulars of
the lynching of the Harmon murderers show that
the execution took place in Edgefield county, near
the Abbeville line. Their crime was one of extraordinary
brutality, six negro men and three
women being directly concerned in it. The proof
of their guilt was so clear that the prisoners made
full confession. The six men were shot by the
citizens, white and colored, in broad daylight, at
the conclusion of the coroner's inquest over their
victims. The women remain in custody of the
sheriff. The constant failure of the courts to
bring murderers to justice is the reason
for the lynching. assigned

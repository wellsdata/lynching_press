Judge Baker of the United States district
court of Indianapolis has decided
that a sheriff is responsible for the life
of a prisoner placed in his charge as
he is for the property confided to his
care. The case comes up on a suit for
damages brought against an Indiana
sheriff by the administrator of the estate
of a man who had been taken from
the sheriff by a mob and lynched. It
is alleged that the sheriff was careless
and negligent, and permitted a mob to
assemble and left the jail without a
proper guard. On such a showing, according
to Judge Baker, the sheriff is
civilly liable damages resulting
from a breach for of official duty.

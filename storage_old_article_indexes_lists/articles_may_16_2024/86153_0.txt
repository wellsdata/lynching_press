THE Maine Standard, speaking of the removal
al of the negro, Harris, to Thomaston, styles
him" this successful and highly popular murderer
." The Arg us quotes this neat hit at the
811
condemned man, and it will undoubtedly go
the rounds of the Democratic press. What
would the Standard and Argus have? Are
they not satisfied that he has been tried, convicted
and sentenced to undergo the death
penalty? Do they consider the fact that he
has not been lynched an evidence of populari-
ty? Do they want him crucified or burnt at
the stake in the summarry manner formerly in
Dovogue in the South? The malignity of the repudiators
toward the black race is a disgrace
on to our common humanity. In this case, a negro
, who has committed an atrocious crime,
has been dealt with according to the strictest
requirements of the law. No disposition to
A treat him with any degree of partiality has
been manifested." That black demon." as
Verrill's counsel'styled him, has received as little
sympathy as any criminal who has ever
been arraigned before a court of justice. He
.deserved none and received none. We remember
white criminals however who have been
at the same time" successful" and" popular."
The Standard also no doubt remembers the
facts, but does not remember to comment upon
them. How about" Neddy McGuire" of Bow-
doinham fame? He and his associates
were
favorites with the ladies of Augusta, and the
ladies of Bath begged the honor of an introduction
after their conviction. So flagrant an
outrage upon decency as this invited 1 comment
but the oracles were silent.,

WHAT WILL THE JURY DO?
Members of a Mob that Lynched a
White Man Are Positively Identified
in Court.
Charlotte, N. C., July 17.- The trial
of twenty citizens of Anson county,
this state, charged with lynching J.
V. Johnson, which has been begun at
Monroe, is developing strong testi-
mony against the members of the
mob. Miss Alice Bogan, daughter of
the sheriff, resumed her testimony, detailing
how the mob broke into the
jail on the plea of having a prisoner
to commit, and how they seized and
held her father, took the keys to John-
sou's cell away from him, released
Johnson, and after tying him with
ropes dragged him off down the road
to the point where he was lynched.
She positively identified several of
the defendants as being members of
the mob. The cross examination of
Sheriff Bogan, who was recalled, failed
to shake his testimony in any particular
. He recognized many of the mem-
bers of the mob and called
names. their

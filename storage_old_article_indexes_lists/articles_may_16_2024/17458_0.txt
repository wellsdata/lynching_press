Alludes to Hughes.
After a series of pointed remarks, as
" Brief terms of office are one of the
safeguards of democracy" and" Hasty
legislation is often if not always a
step backward," Justice Brewer again
referred to Governor Hughes, saying:
" Let it be ever remembered that justice
is essential, but constant shifting
from one plan to another in search of
ideal justice often defeats itself in
purpose. Justice is never secure while
order and stability are destroyed. The
mob puts civilization back; lynching
is a step toward barbarism. Many a
bill needs executive veto, and in New
York state it gets it. If the legislation
was always wise, then the constitution
is a mistake, for that attempts
to confine legislation within certain
limits and not infrequently prevents
that from being done which
existing public opinion calls for present.

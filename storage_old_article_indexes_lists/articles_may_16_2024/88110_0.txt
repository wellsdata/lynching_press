VIEW POINT OF SECTIONAL HATE
The Chicago Chronicle and the New
York Sun are very much wrought up
over the recent lynching of negro
brutes in Georgia who murdered
whole family after outraging the mother
of the family, says an exchange.
The Chronicle and Sun in the blindness
of their sectional hate scores
the entire south for mob violence in
the little Georgia town and very nat-
urally finds nothing to criticize in
the treatment of the negro in the
north. One day last week a press dis
patch Chicago contained the following
from item of news:
home depending upon his labor
their daily bread and he was brutally
murdered because he worked.
The Cheiago Chronicle finds nothing
to condemn in northern mobs for
killing negroes because they want to
earn a living, but it heaps abuse on
the entire south because a maddened
mob lynches a colored murderer and
rapist. In the north the negro has
no rights which mobs should respect,
but in the south, according to the
Chronicle, there is no chastity or life
which colored murderers should
made to respect. be

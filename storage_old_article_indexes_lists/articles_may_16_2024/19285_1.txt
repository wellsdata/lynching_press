The Lynchers.
NEBRASKA CITY, Neb., July 25.- For
two days rumors have been rife that an
organized mob would make an attempt
to lynch Lee Sheilenberger, the murderer
of his little daughter. On Friday
night an attempt was to have been
made to lynch him, but the sheriff,
having been forewarned, had the mob
dispersed by the militia. It was sup
posed to have been the end of the
matter, and therefore citizens were
rather surprised when it was learned
this morning that the vigilantes had
secured an entrance into the jail last
night and hung Shellenberger. An eye
witness says the mob approached the
court house about 2.30 a.m., noiselessly,
masked and well armed
. The guards
being taken completely by surprise,
were easily overpowered. An effort to
break in the heavy iron doors of the
corridors was fruitless and the sheriff's
office was entered; an opening was
made in the floor through which part
of the mob entered. The
prisoner was
dragged out in the court yard and a
rope fastened round his neck. He declared
his innocence of the crime of
which he was charged and convicted,
requested that his body be buried on the
old homestead until he was proven innocent
, when he should be removed to
the side of his dead father and buried
like other people. He never broke
down and remained nervy to the last.
He was strung up dying with a curse
on his lips, as he said:" I'll haunt you
if I can." The mob was composed
chiefly of German farmers from the vicinity
of the murderer's home. It then
dispersed, singing loudly German
song. a

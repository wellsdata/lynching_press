do with the massacre at Kishineff. It would
be as reasonable to hold President Roose-
velt responsible for the lynching of negroes
in the South, of whom many more are
lynched in every decade than there were
Jews murdered at Kishineff. Let Americans
raise money for the relief of the Russian
Jews coming to this country, and let them
express sympathy with the victims of persecution
in Russia, but let them not commit
the folly of demanding that the United
government meddle in a matter that
States in no way appertains to it.

BURLINGTON, Ia., Jan. 31.- Abe Storms
has confessed the murder of Mrs. Fanny
Rathbun and her daughter Mary. The confession
was made to Chief of Police Grenier
and the county attorney. Storms says he
committed the deed Sunday night, Jan. 23.
He killed the mother first in the cellar.
Then he enticed the little girl into the bedroom
above and, after a terrible struggle to
criminally assault her, cut her throat, The
confession was obtained after a long siege
of sweet- box examination. Then Storms
was taken to the morgue, although he
begged not to see the bodies of his victims.
He turned sickly pale and trembled violently
when he gazed on his victims.
Storms and Cox, an alleged accomplice,
are now locked up in the county jail and
strongly guarded by deputies armed with
Winchester rifles. Sheriff Smith has issued
a proclamation to the effect that any attempt
to break into he jail and lynch
Storms will be met with summary treatment
by the deputies, who will not hesitate
to shoot.
All is quiet to- night, though
threats of lynching were made during the
afternoon. Storm's mother was in Burling-
ton to- day. She is a fine looking, intelligent
woman and was much horrified by her
son's predicament. She exclaimed when first
hearing of the murder:" The man who did
that deed ought to be hung, no matter if
he is my son." Cox is held as an accessory
to the crime, although he has not confessed
. His preliminary hearing is set
Wednesday. for

Pontiac, Mich., Aug. 29.-The Influx.
to this city of people from the South,
who state they are seeking shores of:
safety from mob rule and lynch law,
has caused Mayor F. G. Ely and Man-
ager Wm. Otto of the hoard of com-
merce, together with other prominent
white business mer, to call a con-
ierence of both races for the purpose
of providing suitable houses for the
laboring class of people. A mass meet-
ing was recently held at Trinity Bap-
tist church, at which ume the ques-
tion of segregation came up. The dis-
cussion consumed several minutes of
heated debate, but was finally adjust-
ed satisfactorily to all parties present.
Segregation Doomed
The idea of segregation received a
severe blow when a committee ap-
pointed to handle the situation de-
clared that "the Colored people should
be permitted to buy homes wherover
they can finance the deat' and should
be given equal opportunity in business
and industry with white men of Pon-
tiac." A housing campaign which will
provide modest homes that can be sold
to our people on a small payment down
is being considered.)

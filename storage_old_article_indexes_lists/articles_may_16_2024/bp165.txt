Justice-Mississippi Style- Mississippi Style
Mississippi Gov. J. P. Coleman's ex-
pressions of horror over the kidnapping
and undoubted lynching of a young
Negro accused-only accused of rap-
ing a pregnant white woman comes a
little late.Gov.
Coleman and the backward State he
has the prime responsibility for are
only reaping the reward of years of
instilling in corn, pone-fed rabble the
fairy tale that the sanctity of south-
ern white women (when a Negro'is in-
volved) is more blessed than the Cre-
ator.
Governor Coleman, surely, is a dis-
turbed man. He has a right to be. He
was trying his utmost to convince con-
gressmen considering stronger civil
rights measures that his State is a
land of sunshine and honey (correction
magnolia blossoms) and that colored
and white folks there are closer than
kissing cousins.
Peaceful, law abiding Mississippi?
A 23-year-old Negro facing trial the
next day on' a rape charge was beaten
and dragged from an unguarded jail
by a group of self-appointed judges,
jurofs, and executioners, and hustled
off to a familiar fate.
The unfortunate Negro's accuser
said, upon facing him, that he looked
like her attacker, but he didn't sound
like him. This, we submit, is far from
positive identification.
It's enough for a Mississippi mob.
Whatever the justification, the
facts remain unchanged. Governor
Coleman's statement that he had not
been informed of any high feeling over
the crime, is high comedy.
Some Negro-any Negro-must pay
for a white woman's compromised
honor in Mississippi. Governor Cole-
man knows that.
If the young mother was forced to
submit to a sexu√°l indignity, this was a
tragedy in itself. It always is, but it
doesn't justify taking the law and
tearing it to shreds.
Beyond the governor's grandstand
play of indignation lies' the probable
truth that he is actually sore at a mob
that didn't have sense enough to re-
alize that the poor Negro was going to
get the gas chamber for his "crime"
anyway, and all tied up with pretty
legal ribbon, too.
But, mob violence has had its day.
There's an ironic twist, too, if the
coin could be reversed. There is scar-
cely enough acreage in Mississippi to
bury the degenerates who have abused
Negro women down the generations-
and gone scot free.
That, we suppose, is beside the
point.
A miserable crime has been aveng-
ed by the probable death of a man
whose guilt or innocence will never be
known.
That is the worst of all crimes.

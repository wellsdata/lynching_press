" A Negro was lynched at Valdasta,
Ga .. last Thursday, and another was
lynched at Little Rock, Ark., Saturday
night. Still Gov. Northen, of Georgia
, and Gov. Fi- hback, of Arka sas,
challenge the English Anti- Lynching
league to find more law- abiding people
than those over whom they rule. Had
Northen and Fi- hback lived before the
days of the printing press and the telegraph
they would have been regarded
as great and good and most truthful
men. But the English Anti- Lynching
would never have heard of
league them." -- Inter Ocean.

The flashy illustrated papers East give
pictorial accounts of a lynch law execution
in Nashville. The one now before us give
ex- Gov. Neill S. Brown credit for the cou-
ciliatory and sensible speech of the occasion
, when in fact that gentleman knew
nothing of the occurrence until next morning
, it being Gov. John C. Brown who ad-
the rioters and persuaded them to
used disperse.

Sheriff Matais said he had been in
formed that a mob was forming at
Eldorado and Harrisburg and had
planned to go to Vienna on a freight
train.
At Viensa it was planned, so he reported
, to proceed to the jail and lynch
if possible the three negroes. According
to advices received here from
Sheriff Mathis, a rural mail carrier,
Allen Clark, was shot last Saturday
night on a train en route from Vienna
to Harrisburg by a trio of negroes.
To further forestall the repoted
mob, Governor Deneen telegraphed immediately

him not to transport over his
road any crowd of persons such as
described by Sheriff Mathis.

A GREAT VILLAIN.- John B. Harden was
lately hung by lynch law in Milton, Fla., with
a negro, for murder. He confessed the crime
and said he richly deserved death, for he had
been a villain all his life. He had twenty
wives living and had killed sixteen men, and
all he was sorry for was that he was not permitted
to live long enough to kill four more.
Repentance and remorse were strangers to
. He said his father and brother were
him both hung ..

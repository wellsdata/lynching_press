RICHARDSON LYNCHED.
" Quiet and Orderly Mob" Hangs the
Kentucky Murderer.
IRVINE DEPOT, Ky., Oct. 9.- Last night
at 11:30 o'clock Alexander Richardson, who
murdered Mrs. Wiley White Saturday afternoon
near Irvine, was taken from the
jail by 100 determined men, who took him
to a bridge a mile out of town and hung
him. Richardson's examining trial was to
have been held today. The mob was a
very quiet and orderly one. Richardson
protested his innocence to the last and
told the mob if they hung him they would
hang an innocent man. He was hanged at
12:15 this morning and then the mob quickly
dispersed. He was dead in fifteen minutes
.-

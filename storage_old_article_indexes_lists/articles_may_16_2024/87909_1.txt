Fate has laid a heavy hand upon
the South by giving her the burden of
the negro population of the nation,
and while it is true that she frequently
puts a crimp in the race by taking

animal instincts and passions by
preaching social equality to him- and
the next minute turn around and try
to erase him from the face of the earth,
following the tacit suggestions of
for his preceptor.

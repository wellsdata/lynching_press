Robt. T. Frazier, Policeman of
Nashville, the Victim.
His Murderer Lynched by an
Enraged Mob.
At one o'clock Friday last officer
Robt. Frazier, of Nashville, was called
upon to quella disturbance between Jo. is
Reed, colored, and his wife. With his
sual alacrity he responded to the call,
and found it necessary to arrest Reed,
and mildly informed him that he would
have to take him to the work house,
Reed said that no one policeman could
arrest him, and immediately drew a pistol
and shot Mr. Frazier dead. He at
tempted to escape, but was captured,
and taken to jail. At night a frenzied
mob attacked the jail, secured the prison
er, and with a rope around his neck
hurried him off toward the suspension
bridge. On the way some one placed a
pistol against his head and fired, but
the mob halted not. On they went
with their bleeding victim. Reaching
the bridge, they raised the half dead
murderer to the railing to thrust
him over, one end of the rope having
been fastened to the bridge, when an
other ball was sent crashing through
his brain, and he fell head foremost to
the bluff below and rolled into
the river. thence

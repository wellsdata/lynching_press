SOW HATRED
THRU EUROPE
NEW YORK CITY, Sept. 9.
" Wherever a certain class of Ameri-
can tourists go in Europe they continually
and industriously endeavor to
convince Europeans that the Negro in
the United States is ignorant, criminal
, vicious, and above all a rapist
ever ready to criminally assault white
women and restrained only by sheer
brute force in the form of lynching.
was the statement made by Arthur T.
Long, Principal of a large public
school in Indianapolis, Ind., who has
just returned after spending more than
two months in France, Germany, Italy
and Switzerland, according to

Some years ago a great commotion
was created in Louisville
because a man had been caught
coming from the apartments of a
wealthy society white woman by
the irate husband who had unexpectedly
returned home. To the
added horror of the husband the
man was black, who finding his escape
from the inside of the house
blocked, rushed through a window
and slid down a porch post. only
to be shot to death by a passer- by,
who thought the man a Negro
burglar. A crowd gathered& some
suggested burning the" Nigger,"
and when they were about to carry
the suggestion into effect it was
discovered that the" nigger" was
not only a blackened white man
but the husband's own brother.,

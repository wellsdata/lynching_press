ANOTHER BRUTE LYNCHED.
And still the brutish work of Judge
Lynch goes on. But this time a white
man is lynched by colored men, for an
outrage upon a colored woman. We
have always contended that lynching
is wrong and should be stopped.
Heretofore such outrages have been
almost exclusively against colored
men. We condemn white men for
lynching and we condemn colored
men for the same. But what can the
white press of the South say about it?
The Chronicle starts out by saying it
.
Don't
was a weak minded man
the
Chronicle know that any" negro
brute" who attempts such an outrage
is weak minded?" The Chronicle
and its brothers of the quill will learn
some day how to treat these cases.
Men who commit outrages upon wo
men must be punished, but not by
lynch law. Lynchers must be punished
and the press must condemn
them- white as well as black.
If white men are justifiable in
lynching a negro for a certain crime,
then black men
are justifiable in
lynching a white man for the same.
Colored men have borne these great
wrongs very patiently many years. A
spirit of retaliation is growing- and
who can blame the colored man?
Don't we love our women as dearly as
the white men love theirs? And
should we not give life and take life
for them if necessary? If it is right
for white men to kill and die for their
women, it is right for the black man
to kill and die for his own.
Let us see that we respect our own
and all other women and that our
women respect themselves and deserve
the respect of men, then let us do
our duty by them as white men do
by theirs- let us respect them. All
rapers should be hung. Our intelligence
is worth nothing to us if we
havs not manhood to protect our
females.
We do not advise nor encourage
lynching, because it is a crime, but
we advise and urge upon colored men
everywhere to see that our women are
protected against the vile of our own
and low" weak minded" white men.
When one of our ladies is insulted,
see that the brute is punished, whether
he be black or white. We have in
our towns some colored brutish pimps
who deserve a rope about their necks
- they should be watched,
and driven out of the community spurned.

THE PLEA OF INSANITY seems to be the favorite
mode of getting murderers off from a deserved
fate. Gov. Gardner, of Massachusetts, has respited
James Wilson, who was to have been hung in Bos
ton, Friday, for murder, for sixty days, in order to
give him time to evidence of his insanity
at the time of the produce commission of the deed.

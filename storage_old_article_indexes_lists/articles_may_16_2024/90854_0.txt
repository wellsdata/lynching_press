Mob Tries to Lynch.
Webster Grove, the St. Louis suburb,
was wildly excited over the tragedy, when
Bertram A. Atwater, the young Chicago
artist who had gone to visit his betrothed
, was waylaid by highwaymen. One
of the robbers, John Schmidt, wounded
to death by the plucky Chicagoan, will
die. The other thug, Sam Foster, a colored
ex- convict, who fired the fatal shots,
and Peter Schmidt, who arranged the
trap into which Mr. Atwater was unsus-
expectingly lured and then slain, are in
custody. At their examination they tried
to escape, and only determined action by
officers prevented a mob from lynch-
the ing them.

THE practice of running off with a
prisoner to a jail somewhere else in order
to protect him from mob violence
has been brought to a short stop by
Judge Cantrell at Frankfort. Threats
of lynching a Negro murderer and rapist
being made the county judge ordered
him to be taken to Lexington,
but Judge Cantrell countermanded the
order and told the sheriff that it was
his duty to protect the prisoner and he
must do so at all hazards, summoning
as many men as he needed, the judge
himself among the number if necessary
." This no child's play," he
continued," No man shall be lynched
here while this court is in session.
That prisoner must be protected. He
shall not be mobbed. He will not be
mobbed." And he was not mobbed,
nor will he be. All that is necessary
to protect prisoners is for the officers
have some backbone and a judge
to who means business.

FELDER WANTS TO
MEET GOV. BLEASE
Atlanta Attorney Stirred
By Offer of South Caro-
lina Governor
Atlanta, July 14 .-" I am neither a bully
nor a braggart, but I am willing to meet
Blease anywhere outside the state of
South Carolina and gave him any personal
satisfaction he desires." This statement
was made today by Thomas B. Fel-
der on his return to Atlanta after testifying
before the special investigating
committee of the South Carolina legislature
, probing the old state dispensary
case at Augusta. The statement was in
answer to a declaration made yesterday
at Bamberg, S. C., by Gov. Cole L
Blease in which he said" I will give any
man$ 1000 who will get Tom Felder two
feet on this side of the Savannah river
and let me be present."
In this statement Governor Blease also
excoriated the members of the investigating
committee in bitter terms, adding," It
is against the law to send challenges in
South Carolina, but if any member of
that committee will come to me and tell
me that he believes what Tom Felder
said, you won't need any duelling law,
and Charlie Smith will be your governor."
C. A. Smith is lieutenant governor of
South Carolina.
Continuing, the governor referred to the
lynching of three negroes recently in
Olar, S. C., and is quoted as follows:
" You did like men and defended your
neighbors and put their black bodies under
the ground."
On his return to Atlanta today Mr.
Felder was accompanied by E. S. Seed,
the detective whose evidence secured with
,
a telephonic device, created a sensation
at the Augusta hearing.
Mr. Felder stated that he would press
even greater charges against Governor
Blease when his term as governor
South Carolina expired. of

formally charged with the murder of Carroty
Nell, the greatest excitement has prevailed
in and about Whitechapel. The
police station where the prisoner is detained
is surrounded by a vast crowd of
people, mostly women. The women are
eager for a sight of the prisoner. Wild
threats of lynching and tearing the prisoner
to pieses were uttered by the most
excited of these.
When the man was removed to the
police court an immerse force of police
was employed and every precaution was
necessary in order to prevent the White-
chapel mob from lynching the blood-
stained prisoner. Opinions differ as to
whether the man charged with the tour-
der of Carroty Nell is the murderer known
as" Jack the Ripper." The inhabitants of
Whitechapel believe that he is, but the
themselves to
police have committed
an opinion on not the subject.

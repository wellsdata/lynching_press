No Troops Needed
To Protect Rapist;
He Is A White Man
In Lexington,
Kentucky,
where
1,000 state troops were called out re-
cently to prevent lynching of a col-
ored man accused of murder, a white
man has been arrested charged with
rape of an 11-year-old colored girl, .
and attack upon a 17-year-old girl,
according to reports received by the
National Association for the Advance-
ment of Colored People. To date no
call for troops has been sent out
to protect the white rapist from mob
violenco.
The Lexington Leader, a local white
dally, states that the young white
man was accused by two colored
girls, one 17 and one 11 years old,
of forcing them at the point of a
revolver to accompany him into a
laundry, where he tore off their
clothes and assaulted the younger
girl.
A doctor who examined the younger
girl shortly after the attack, is re-
ported to have found she bore traces
of having been criminally assaulted.
Both girls identified the young white
as their attacker, after he had
been found and arrested.
The attack occurred 6 days prior
to the hanging of the Negro whom
It had been nocessary to protect from
a mob with 1,000 state troops.
The National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People has
hdvised its Lexington Branch to
bring all possible pressure upon the
state authorities to enforce the law
equally against the white criminal;
colored people having stood for law
enforcement against the colored mur-
derer who was convicted in court and
hanged.

GOVERNOR NOT ANXIOUS
TO PUNISH LYNCHERS
Frankfort, Ky., Jan. 16 .-" There's
no use for a physician to prescribe
for a patient after he's dead," said
Governor Wilson, when asked what
course he would take relative to the
lynching of the three negroes in
Shelbyville yesterday morning.
Invitations to attend the lynching
are said to have been extended a
theatrical company which was playing
in Shelbyville
Saturday night.
Members of the company say they
were told that if they would remain
up until 2 or 3 a. m. they" would see
some fun." Later a stage hand told
them
some negroes were to be lynched
. The members of the mob, they
say, included many negroes.
Governor Willson said, from reports
the lynching was talked about
to strangers
in Shelbyville several
hours before it occurred and the governor
was not notified.
He says if he had heard about it
three hours before it happened he
would have prevented lynching if
It took all the soldiers the in the state.

New Orleans, July 20.- Three negroes,
one a minister, have been lynched near
Jonesville, Catahoula Parish, for burning
a cotton gin in a spirit of religious
frenzy. For some time past Rev. Albert
Godlin has been preaching the end of the
world to the negroes of Catahoula Parish.
He began at Harrisonburg, but being
driven from there, he moved near Jones-
ville, where he renewed his preaching.
Here, assisted by a negro woman, he
preached that he was Christ; that the
world would soon come to an end, and
the wicked would be punished. Among
the wicked, in his declaration, was Capt.
J. W. Swayzee, a white farmer, who, he
sald, would be soon visited by a great
misfortune. His sermons caused great
a
deal of demoralization among the ne-
groes, many of whom left work to await
the coming of the end of the world.
Authorities Aroused.
The burning of the cotton gin of Capt.
Swayzee by incendiaries aroused the
suspicion of the authorities. They arrested
two negroes, Miller Gaines and
Sam Gaines, who confessed that they
had, with the assistance and at the suggestion
of Rev. Albert Godlin, burned
the gin, expecting to arous: the negroes
thereby and to point to the destruction
of the gin as evidence of the truth of
his prophecies. The men were placed
in the Jonesville jail, which was broken
into by a mob and the men hanged to a
neighboring tree.
The woman who was mixed up in
affair escaped. the

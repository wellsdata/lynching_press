COMPARES LYNCHING WITH NAZI OUTRAGES LYNCHING WITH NAZI OUTRAGES
HALDEMAN-JULIUS,
publisher of
J. the Little Blue Books, who usually
strikes the bull's-eye on almost every ques-
tion, compares Jewish presecution in Ger
many and the lynching of Negroes in Amer-
ica in the American Freeman for September,
1934. He says:
He says
"The cases are not similar at all. Lynch-
ings in the United States are committed by
the lowest elements of our inhabitants in
sections that are notoriously backward. . . These lynch-
ings are not provoked by our Federal or state govern-
ments. The White House does not conduct a lynch pro-
paganda. Congress has passed no laws authorizing the
lynching of Negroes. The Supreme Court has never said
that lynchings are legal. Our philosophers have never
outlined a theory of justifying racial persecution. .
"In Germany, on the other hand, racial persecution
is part of a nation's law. Hitler has made racial persecu-
tion a perfectly legal procedure. The courts defend such
behavior. The professors write 'learned' books on the
necessity for racial persecution. The powers of the state
are used to provoke acts of discrimination and violence
against racial minorities."
WORD JUGGLING
This is mere juggling with words,
and had it been some other question,
Haldeman-Julius, himself, would have
been among the first to call it that.
The barbarous Nazis openly declare
that the Jew is not their equal and
him
promptly proceed to treat
such. Good. moral, Christian Amer-
ica writes in her Constitution that
the so-called Negro is an equal, and
then proceeds to treat him far more
barbarously than the most barbarous
Nazi has ever treated a Jew. The
treatment of the Jew in
Germany-
and this is no attempt to condone it-
has been greatly exaggerated by cer-
tain Jewish editors and leaders

AMERICANS MORE BAKBAROUS
The Nazis ,so far, have yet to
take a Jew, unsex him, and toss the
gruesome objects to the women and
children in the crowd, or to burn a
Jew alive and drag his charred
mails through the town,

When it comes to real downright
savagery the Nazis will have to come
to America for lessons.
Helleman-Julius is quite
wrong
when he says lynching is confined to
backward communities. Certainly

have never advocated lynching, but
what is just as bad or worse than
the Nazis they have done nothing to
prevent it, though it is their sworn
duty to do so. Were it dogs that
were being lynched in America, the
Christita churches which are so anx-
ious to make America good an
moral in every other respect would
have raisell such a howl that the
forces of law from the White House
downwards would get busy at once
to stop it.
BEGINS AT THE TOP
Further, lynching has been openly
advocated on the floors of Congress,
which, woreover, has resolutely r
fused to pass a law making it illegal.
One turns in vain the darkest pages
of history for a parallel to this. Con-
rary to Haldeman-Julius, American
philosophers by the scores have
written in justification of racial per
secution, among them no less a ore
than the great Lester F. Ward. The
Federal government itself, in direct
violation of the document from which
it derives its authority, has evolved
a philosophy of racial discrimination
and practics it. Lynching begins at
the top.
It begins in the Federal
and state governments, the churches,
the universities and centers of cul-
ture, and works its way downwards.
The lynchers are merely carrying out
what many of the upper classes feel,
and would like to do themselves. The
lynchers are but the bouncers

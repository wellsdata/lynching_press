TO SOUTH
( By Staff Correspondent.)
OZARK, ALA., Aug. 25.- Evidence
that the economic pressure being
brought to bear on account of the
wave of lynching now prevailing in
the South is bearing fruit was apparent
at the Dale County Circuit Court
when Judge J. S. Williams, presiding
over the fall session, instructed the
grand jury to go to the very roots of
the lynching of two colored men, Sill
and Juster Jenkins, on the
Spinks night of July 30, near Grimes, Ala.

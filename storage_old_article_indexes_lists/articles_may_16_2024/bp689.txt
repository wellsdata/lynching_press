MOBS
and
Atlanta, Ga., Aug. 10.-Immediate
suppression of mob violence and
lynching, more generous provision
for education, and the employment
of farm and home demonstration
agents to teach the people how to
make a living under holl weevil con-
ditions, were the most important
steps urged by the Georgia Race Re-
lations committee, not only as mat-
ters of justice, but also as essential
to stop the northward migration of
our people. The committee, in ses-
sion here a few days ago, called
upon the authorities to do their ut-
most to put down mol, violence, and
all good citizens were urged to stand
behind the officers and the courts
in all efforts to this end. Attention
was called also to the need of giv-
ing the governor authority to deal
effectively with sheriffs, who are de-
linquent in their duties.
The legislature was asked to pro-
vide more generously for schools of
higher grade and each county was
urged to build at least one good.
school of this character. The com-
mittee called attention to the val-
uable work done by the few farm
and home demonstration agents in
the state, and the employment of
such agents in every county was
recommended as a means of teach-
ing the people how to make a living
under boll weevil conditions.

women's section of the committee
had secured funds for the employ-
ment of a public health nurse

ing and training groups to look after
maternal and infant welfare.
During the past two years the
committee, through its secretary, Dr.
T. J. Woofter, Jr., has directed its
efforts largely to the suppression of
mob violence, through public senti-
ment and court procedure. During
that time the number of lynchings
has greatly decreased, one only hav-
ing occurred in the first half of 1923.
A great deal has been done also in
the way of supplying legal aid to
helpless victims of mobs and other
injustice. Many of Georgia's best
people are active in the committee's
membership.

If Walton County Georgia nua
done what it should have done in
1946 when four Negrues were
lynched in cold blood by some un-
godly white men, this state, coun-
try and world would have been
better off.
Instead, no one has ever been
tried and convicted for this aw-
ful crime. America must learn
that "sin must be paid for." It
may be short or long as far as
time goes, but sin must be paid
for. The committer may be white
or black, rich or poor, learned or
unlearned the fact still remains
that sin must be paid for.
It is hard to believe that four
people could have been lynched
in Walton County and no one pun-
ished for the crime. Yet, that's
what happened in this Christian
land of ours. A land where its
leaders are now telling other na-
tions about treatment of minority
groups. A nation who sets itself
up to tell others about wrong do-
ings.
Sin begets sin. A lie must be
backed up with a lie. Now our
fair state has once again been
disgraced. In this self-same coun-
ty, Walton, at a place called Lo-
ganville and other points in the
county, perhaps, Negro churches
and schools have been burned.
They were not all burned at the
same time. Yet one man is sup-
posed to have done this nasty act.
And that man is said to have been
a Negro.
This whole situation, it seems
to me, has many loop holes in it.
It is hard to make some of the
things in this case make sense.
We hope the accused man's law-
yer will see to that. And may I
compliment the Rev. Charles C.
Britton, fearless pastor of the
AME Zion church burned at Lo-
ganville. He deserves praise for
his stand. Some preachers in such
cases as the pastor take the cold
feet in issues like the Loganville
quixup.
Every minister who heads a Ne-
gro church organization in this
state and country should get be-
hind this cuse. There is something
funny about the whole thing. Now
is the time for every pastor, min-
ister. both white and colored, es-
pecially colored to support the
leaders who have thus far taken
the lead in this case and try to
see that justice is done,
THE ston!!
attention of the Baptist and
Methodist churches in this state
and country. What has happened
in Walton County could happen in
any county. The possibilities are
here. I hope I shall never hear of
a church and school house being
burned in Georgia again.
What are the preachers in Geor-
gia going to do about this case?
The fair name of the church and
race has been hit in that it is said
that whiskey was found under the
burnt church, and that the people
around the church had lived un-
worthy of decent people. If they
found whiskey after the church
was burned why didn't somebody
find it before it was destroyed by
fire. It seems reasonable to believe
that somebody in Loganville knew
about that liquor before the fire.
Then on second thought, whose
liquor was it?
The preachers should take the
lead in raising money to help re-
build these churches of stone or
brick, fire proof, in the same lo-
eation. If there is no racial ill
will in Loganville, the rebuilding
of these editices will be perfect-
ly all right with the City Fathers.
Personally. I am willing to give
of my meager carthly holdings to
see that justice is done in this
case. Let the heads of Negro
church organizations speak out
strongly and boldly. Then let them
raise some money. Don't say it,
let's do it!

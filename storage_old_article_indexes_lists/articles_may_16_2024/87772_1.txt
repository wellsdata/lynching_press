Gov. Slaton branded Frank's
lynching as a deep blot on his
State." The act is a consum-
+ mate outrage," he said," and
+ every man engaged in the
lynching should be hanged,
for he is an assassin. Such an
act is contrary to the civilization
of Georgia, and one
which every citizen will
condemn." good

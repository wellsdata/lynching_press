Elmore Cases to Date.
Three cases in all were tried before
Judge Denson and a jury, and three
were continued until the fall term of
the court Of the three cases that
were tried, George Howard was found
guilty of murder in the first degree
and sentenced to the penitentiary for
life; Martin Fuller was found guilty
of murder in the second degree, and
sentenced to the penitentiary for ten
years; John Strength was found guilty
of murder in the second degree, and
sentenced to the penitentiary for ten
years. Lem Strengtn, Will Still and
Ben Martin, Jr., are to be tried at the
fall term of the court.
The customary trouble in proving
that the men were actually present as
participants in the lynching occurred,
but Solicitor Brewer urged that all
were guilty who were seen at Thomas'
store on the morning the negro Bob
White was taken from there by the
bailiffs and who were seen later six
or seven miles away, where the lynching
took place. He held that such ap
accidental,
pearances were not but
that they were parts of a prearranged
plan, and that they corroborated How
ard's testimony or confession.
These trials were stoutly contested,
and every effort was made by the
lawyers engaged by the prisoners to
prejudice the minds of the jurors, but
they were held to their duty, guided
as they were by Juage Denson, whose
mind is as clear as his courage is superb
. Judge and jury have alike
earned the gratitude or all friends of
law and order in the State, for they
have demonstrated the possibility of
the punishment of law breakers by
their own neighbors. These cases in
Emore will long stand as a bright ex
ample, and it is safe to say that there
will not soon be another lynching in
that county. Similar convictions are
needed in every county in which a
lynching occurs, and if judge, solicitor
and juries will do their duty up to the
Eimore standard there will be no
trouble in putting an end to the lynching
habit in this Sate. points
the way. Elmore

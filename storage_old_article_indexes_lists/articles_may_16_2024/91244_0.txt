A Pharisalcal Reproof.
The New York Times rebukes the citizens of one
of the interior towns of that State for an attempt to
put in operation the code of Judge Lynch, and re-
or minds them that they dwell in a section of country
We
where the standard of morality is or should be rather
hail- higher than in ordinary places, and may be regarded
. therefore as exponents of a higher civilization. We L.
ac- quote a single paragraph:
The citizens of Ithaca seem disposed to bring on
New York a portion of the stain of barbarism which
was Lynch law has inflicted upon so many of our South-
with ern and Western neighbors, and without the faintest
the show of reason or even of excuse. We had to record J.
the other day the murder of a man in cold blood in a
or jail in Kentucky by persons who feared that if he
, were liberated he would probably do them some in-
and jury, and, stranger still, the justification of the act
by a formal presentment of the Grand Jury. But
upon Kentucky is, after all, Kentucky, and nobody expects
with to see it in the tenacious adherence of the forms of
, law on which communities like our own, which claim
any credit for a higher stage of civilization and more
it regulated impulses, generally pride themselves.
just The claims of New York and Boston to having
to reached a" higher stage of civilization" than their
Southern and Western neighbors are about as well
large
, founded as their pretentions to a more refined litera-
, ture. We will admit the former when the excess of
these crime in New York city in proportion to its popular
, tion is reduced to the decent limits of other cities'
and the latter when Boston publishes an enterprising
and readable newspaper
more.

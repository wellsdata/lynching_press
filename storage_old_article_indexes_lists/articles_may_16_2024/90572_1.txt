Will Punish Mob Leaders
COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., Sept.
13.- Whatever power the governor has
to apprehend the punish the leaders of
the mob which lynched the alleged
slayers of Patrolman Evans at Pueblo
tonight will be used to the limit, Governor
Shoup said here tonight. The
Associated Press story gave him first
news of the lynching and he expressed
the deepest indignation at the outrage.
" Such action as this cannot but be
deplored" he said." I hesitate to say
what action I shall take until I can
confer with the attorney general to determine
my powers, but you can say
that I will use all the powers at my
command to run down the mob leaders
and to see that they are adequately
punished. In times fo unrest such as
these through which we are passing,
outbreaks such as this at Pueblo can
only serve to undermine public respec
for the orderly processes of law and endanger
the peace and safety of the
nation. They must not be permitted to
pass unpunished."
The governor is preparing for a trip
to western Colorado but may be forced
to delay his trip to meet this
gency. emer-

MOB RULE STILL IS
QUITE POPULAR IN
STATE OF GEORGIA
( Special to The Tribune)
MACON, Ga., Aug. 18 .-" Lynch Law
Must Go." They are still at it in
Georgia, which seems destined to sink
to much lower levels in the scale of
civilization.
An extra heavy guard was ready to
be thrown around the Bibb county
jail to protect three men held in connection
with the murder of several
months ago of A. L. Allgood, a street
car conductor.
The guard was assembled early
when the word that several hundred
persons had gathered in Central City
park and were planning an attack on
the county jail. Later reports, said,
however, that the crowd had dispersed
without making any sort of demonstration
.
Fear Race Riot
The precautionary steps followed a
day of excitement in Macon and uneasiness
on the part of the authorities,
who expressed fears of a serious race
clash growing out of the lynching at
Holton, near here, of John Glover,
charged with the murder here of Deputy
Sheriff Walter C. Byrd. Glover
was taken from an Atlanta train at
Griffin and shot to death.
Scenes of disorer and the display of
uncertain temperaments were witnessed
when the body was brought back
to Macon and dumped into the street
in front of a colored theater, where it
remained in a half upright position
for some time. Men of all ages jammed
into Broadway and fought their
way to the body, seeking souveiners.
Will Probe Lynching
Officers believe that the prompt
closing of the business section of
Broadway, the scene of the recent disorders
in which Deputy Byrd was
killed, prevented a race clash.
Judge W. E. H. Searcy of the Mon-
roe circuit announced that he would
call a special session of the grand
jury at Forsyth for the fourth Monday
in August to investigate the
of Glover. lynching

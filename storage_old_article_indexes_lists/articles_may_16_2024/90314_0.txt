RACE TROUBLE IN MEXICO
Nine Negroes Lynched, Four of Them
Americans.
Cincinnati, O., May 23.- A special
to the Enquirer from Diaz, Mexico,
says: There is great excitement in
the town of San Dialo, ten miles from
here, over the lynching of seven colored
men, laborers on the Mexican
Central railroad. Jose Santo, a Span-
ish negro, attempted to assault the
wife of Sencr Dupley, a ranch owner,
and escaping from the plantation was
tracked by bloodhounds and in ccm-
pany with nine others was captured in
a hut on the river bank opposite
Eagle Pass.
The regulators did not attempt to
prove the guilt of any of the negroes,
but hung three of thera and shot four
more who were attempting to escape.
Officials are swearing in deputies, as a
race trouble is threatened in the colored
quarter. Four of the negroes
killed were Americans and all had
served sentences in the Texas penitentiary

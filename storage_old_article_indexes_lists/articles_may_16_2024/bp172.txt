Chicago NAACP Urges:
'Send Troops To Miss."
By ROBERT L. BIRCHMAN BIRCHMAN ROBERT L.
Occupation of Mississippi with
Federal troops to halt the wave of
terror, intimidation and lynching of
Negroes who refuse to bow to the
Jim Crow system was called for
this week by the Chicago branch
of the NAACP at a special meet-
ng of its executive committee.
The resolution,
introduced by
terald D. Bullock, chairman of the
legislative committee of the as-
sociation, called upon the national
officials of the NAACP to urge
pon Congress "the early with-
drawal of the right of Federal and
local franchise from the State of
Mississippi," and its occupation
by Federal troops for an indeterm-
inate time, "during which an in-
vestigation of the causes and re-
sults of abrogations of citizens
rights in violation of the Consti-
ution shall be thoroughly prose-
ented by the present Hennings
Committee of the Senate, or by
: Committee especially appointed
by the Congress.”
Suspension of Mississippi's rep:
resentatives in the U. S. Congress,
and its state and local govern-
ments was called for with the af-
fairs of the State to be in charge
of a Federal administrator, sup-
ported by Federal troops until such
time a "it becomes the judgment
of Congress" that Mississippi has
"demonstrated an understanding
:nd practical grasp of such fund-
amentals of democracy as may
cause her to become a fit and
proper associate of the other
States of our Nation."
LONG RECORD
The Chicago NAACP pointed out
that Mississippi has a "long his-
tory and record of State-condoned
disregard" for the democratic
principles upon which this nation
was founded and has permitted its
citizens to indulge in "subversion
of basic human rights" through
'murder by mob action of citi-
zens not yet legally adjudged
guilty of any crime," and by
"holding an entire section of citi-
zenry in a state bordering on slav-
ery by the use of threats, intimi-
dation, violence, unfair and gen-
erally uncountenanced economic
practices, refusal of the right to
free access and use of the ballot
box, the use of cultural and ed-
ucational facilities supported by
the taxation of all."
DEFIES U. S.
The NAACP further charged that
"the State of Mississippi has sub-
verted the Constitution of the
United States" by defiance of the
rulings of the Supreme Court and
by repeated instances of State ac-
tions in violation of the Constitu-
tion and that all sections of author-
ity-legislative, executive and ju-
dicial in Mississippi "have long
been tolerant, in condonment or
openly guilty" of such violations.
"These acts and attitudes," on
the part of Mississippi, "have re-
sulted in disrepute for our nation
in the eyes of the world an d
have caused the world to have “a
just and natural suspicion con-
cerning our racial attitudes a n d
policies,” said the NAACP resolu-
tion. These charges the NAACP
stated weight "heavily against her
right to sovereignity among the
States of this Nation."

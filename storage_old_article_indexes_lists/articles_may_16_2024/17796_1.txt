Details of the Lynching.
The lynching of Drummond took place at
o clock this morning. Drummond was
boarding at the house of Esquire Landrum
and was working in the Shamrock mines.
About 1 o'clock, the militia surrounded
the house and demanded Drummond.
There were twenty- five or thirty soldiers
dressed in uniform and carrying guns with
fixed bayonets. They went to Drummond's
room. He had gone down stairs in the
kitchen where he locked the door and re
fused to surrender except to a sheriff and
he was told the authority for his arrest
was higher than a sheriff.
At last he agreed to surrender and did.
He was once a soldier in the marine service
. He was marched from his boarding
house and a teamster in the militia camps,
it was noticed, carried a hemp rope.
At day this morning Drummond's body
was found hanging from a railroad trestle
a few hundred yards from where he was
arrested. The motive for lynching him was
that he had been one of a party that ran
the soldiers off from a house of illfame a
few weeks ago, and it is further charged.
he was with the party that killed Laugherty.
With so many idle the danger of trouble
becomes greater. If all remain sober further
trouble may be averted, but too much
whisky might provoke disastrous collision.
The striking miners assert posively
they will not work at the proposed redue
tion while the operators are just as posi
they will not yield. There is no tell
tive will be.

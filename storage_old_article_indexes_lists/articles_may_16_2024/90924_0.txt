lowing the election of 1896, that Col.
William Jennings de-
Bryan was
feated and that William Mc
Kinley would be the next
President of the United States:
For they labored under the hallucination
that he would not permit any
more Colered people to be mobbed
and lynched in any section of this
republic.
While delivering his first inaugural
address the 4th of March, 1897 he declared
" that mob and lynch law must
not be tolerated in this highly civi.
Hi- zed country;" but as a matter of
fact he never put forth the slightest
effort to suppress mob and lynch law,
and more victims fell under its sway
during the first four years of his Lily
White Administration than during the
administrations of any of his predecessors
. He repeatedly declared, and also
his Attorney- General shortly after the
burning of Sam Hose down in Georgia
in 1892, that" the Federal Government
would not interfere no matter if one
hundred or one thousand Negroes were
mobbed and lynched each week."

NEGRO OFFENDS ONE
KILLS ANOTHER AND
IS THEN LYNCHED
[ Republican A. P. Leased Wire]
GREEN RIVER, Wyo., Dec. 10.- A
mob of 500 persons today lynched" Joe"
Woodson, a negro, hanging him from a
telephone pole in front of the courthouse
, after he had shot and killed Al-
bert Miller, a switchman for the Union
Pacific railway, and wounded another
railroad man.
The shooting followed the ejection of
the negro from the dining room at the
Union Pacific station. It was said that
the negro, who was employed there as
a porter, had made an offensive remark
in the hearing of the railroad men, to
a white girl, a waitress. Woodson later
returned to the dining room, armed
with a revolver, and began firing.
Miller fell at the first shot. Another
bullet struck his companion, Curtis,
entering one arm.
Deputy sheriffs reached the place
shortly afterward and arrested Wood-
son, taking him to the county jail.
In the meantime the mob, which consisted
partly of railroad men, began
forming. It marched to the jail and,
after overpowering the guards seized
the negro nad hanged him.
Efforts of Arthur Dixon, sheriff of
Sweetwater county, to learn the identity
of any member of the mob, have
proved fruitless, he telephoned to Governor
Houx at Cheyenne this afternoon.
None of the mob members wore masks
but the sheriff was not able to identify
any of them.
The last lynching in Wyoming occurred
in this county about one year
ago, when a negro was hanged for an
attack upon a white woman. Only four
persons participated in hanging
but their identity never was the learned.

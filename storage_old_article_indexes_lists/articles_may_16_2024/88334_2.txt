Says Lynching Was Justified.
" I wouldn't spend one cent to prosecute
the members of the mob," declared
District Attorney Shackleford.
" I think the lynching was perfectly
justifiable and so far as I am con.
cerned the members of the mob may
rest in peace. A lynching is a nasty
affair, but where a crime like this
man committed is involved lynch law
is perfectly justifiable."
Everything was quiet at Muldrow.
Reports that negroes were being ordered
out of town met with emphatic
denial, as did reports that negroes
arming themselves. In fact, ne.
were groes helped to lynch Turner.

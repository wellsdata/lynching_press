TWO NEGROES LYNCHED.
Run Down and Shot for Killing a Planter
-Mob After a Third Man
MEMPHIS, Tenn., Feb. 4.- Two negroes
have been lynched for the murder of James
Eastland, one of the best known planters
of Sun Flower county, Miss. A posse of
men with bloodhounds is hunting a third
fugitive, Luther Holbert, for whom a re
ward of$ 1,500 has been offered.
Eastland interfered in a quarrel be
tween Holbert and another man, ordering
Holbert to leave his place. This enraged
Holbert, and he conspired with two other
negroes, John Winters and John Watson,
to kill Eastland. Yesterday the three
men came on the planter and his servant
unarmed in a field. The negroes at once
opened fire, the first shot killing Eastland
and the second his servant. Posses at
once started in pursuit.
Winters was the first to fall into the hands
of the pursuers, and he was at once shot
to death. Watson was captured later in
the day and was lynched by a mob of
persons. 500

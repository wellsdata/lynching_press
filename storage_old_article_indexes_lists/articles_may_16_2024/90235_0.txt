TUG OF WAR
A Suspected Negro Lost the
Contest
The Lynching of a Man Only Suspected
, but Protesting His Innocence of
the Killing of a Policeman.
Joplin, Mo., April 15.- An infuriated
mob took an unknown tramp negro
from the city jail tonight and hanged
him to a telephone pole, two blocks
from the jail. The negro was charged
with having murdered Policeman C.
Leslie, who was shot dead last night
in the Kansas City Southern railroad
yard while. endeavoring to arrest several
negroes suspected of theft. Les-
lie had ordered several negroes, who
had taken refuge in a box car to surrender
, and when they failed to do so
he fired several shots at the car. During
the shooting a negro slipped from
the car and coming up behind the policeman
, shot him through the head.
The negro then fled and within a short
time posses were after him.
About 3 o'clock this afternoon Lee
Fullerton, aged twenty- one, located
the fugitive in a slaughter house just
east of Joplin. The negro was armed
with a rifle and defied arrest. Fuller-
ton slipped into the structure unob-
served and crept up behind the negro.
Suddenly he sprang at the unsuspecting
fugitive and before resistance
could be made, he had the negro on
his back with a knife at his throat.
The negro then surrendered his rifle,
and pointing the weapon at him, Ful-
lerton marched him out of the build-
ing. With the assistance of another
man the negro was brought to Joplin
and placed in the jail.
News of the capture spread rapidly
and the jail was speedily surrounded
by hundreds of people. There were
cries of" lynch him," and City Attorney
Decker mounted the jail and
steps
made a strong plea in behalf of law
and order. This served to temporarily
stay the mob, but did not appease it,
and a short time after Decker's speech
the mob started in to batter in the
side of the jail. Every effort was made
to prevent the entrance of the mob
without avail, and within fifteen minutes
, the infuriated men had gained
entrance to the jail and secured the
trembling negro.
As he was dragged forth City Attorney
Decker again interfered and urged
that the negro be given a trial and for
an hour he spoke and the mob listened
to him with the negre in their custody.
At one time it seemed that the city
attorney would win, as members of the
mob began dispersing, but suddenly a
rush was made for the spot where the
negro was being held, and he was dragged
two blocks from the jail, a rope
fastened around his neck, and after the
rope had been thrown over the cross
arm of a telegraph pole a score of men
attempted to pull the negro from the
ground.
As many more seized the negro and
pulled to prevent him from being hanged
. For some moments it was a veritable
tug of war, but reinforcements
on the free end of the rope proved
stronger, and the negro, despite his
protestations of innocence, was finally
swung into the air and strangled to
death, while shouts of satisfaction
went up from the mob. The name of
the negro was not known, and he is a
stranger in Joplin. As soon as the negro
was dead, the mob dispersed, and
later the body was cut down and taken
in charge by the coroner.
The lynching of the negro served
to only temporarily satisfy the indig-
nation of the mob, and later tonight
hundreds of men again assembled and
rioted through the negro section of the
city, burning houses and stoning ne-
groes, and finally drove every negro
from the confines of Joplin. The pelice
were powerless. The first act of the
mob after hanging the negro was to
demand the release from jail of a local
Bill
"
character known" Hickory
,
as
who was under arrest on the charge of
assaulting a negro In the hope that
.
this would appease the mob, the prisoner
was set free. But the mob did not
disperse. Instead, a rush was made
through the main street, the principal
street of Joplin, and every negro was
frightene doff the street and fled to the
north part of the city where the colored
population resides. In this way
the negroes were driven from all parts
of the city to the negro section.
Then the mob charged down on that
section. Stones were thrown, doors
and winodws of negro houses were
broken in and finally several houses
were fired. The department responded
but many of the houses were burned
to the ground. The mot made endeavors
to prevent the fire department
from extinguishing the flames, and
were partially successful. All the officers
of the city, township and county
were called out, but the mob swept
the maside, and proceeded with the
rioting.
Mayor Trigg ran from corner to corner
and, mounting boxes, made earnest appeals
to the mob to cease but beyond
cheering the mayor vociferously, the
mob swept on and the depredations
continued. The saloons were hurriedly
closed by the mayor.
After the hundreds of frenzied men
composing the mob vented their wrath
in the north end of the city, the rush-
ed to the southern end, where lived a
number of negroes. Their houses were
vacant, and not a negro could be found.
Three more houses were fired, and two
consumed. All efforts
were to reason
with the rioters were futile as appar-
ently a frenzy had seized upon them.
The streets were thronged and at 11:15
o'clock the whole city was in an uproar
. So far as known at that hour no
fatalities had occurred, although
persons had received minor injuries many.

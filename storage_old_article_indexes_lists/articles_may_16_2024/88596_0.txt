Danville, Ill., July 25.- The city of Dan-
ville, about one hundred and fifty miles
south of Chicago, has witnessed an uprising
by white against black, and at 11
o'clock tonight, with one negro lynched
and a white man dead as the result of
a ball from an Ethiopian's pistol, a mob
clamors at the county jail for the life
of a second negro. Severat blacks have
been badly beaten, many of them are
arming, while others are leaving town by
the less frequented streets.
The name of the negro who was lynched
is not known, but it is understood he is
from Evansville. The mob is after James
Wilson, a negro, who has confessed to a
brutal assault on Mrs. Thomas Burgess.
wife of a farmer at Alvin, Ill., just
north of here. The unknown negro met
his fate while the mob was on the way
to lynch Wilson. The angry throng was
passing down East Main street when the
negro became involved in an altercation
with some of its members. They started
after him and he pulled a gun, firing into
the crowd.

Henry Gatterman, a young
who has recently returned from Fortress
Monroe, fell mortally wounded and expired
in a few seconds. The negro turned
and fled but was caught by the officers
within a block of the scene of the tragedy
, and hurried to the police station with
the mob in hot pursuit, temporarily diverted
from their march to the county
jail. The officers with their prisoner took
refuge in the city building, barricad-
themselves behind the door of one
ing of the offices.
Jail Stormed.
They could not check the mob, however
, for it secured a long pole and proceeded
to batter down a section of the
wall and the door, both of which were
very thin. On account of the overwhelming
numbers of the mob, it was useless
for the officers to resist. The negro was
seized and rushed to the spot where he
had shot down Gatterman.
It was the work of an instant to throw
a rope around his neck and swing him up
to the nearest telephone pole. The mob
did not delay long but waited to see that
their victim was dead. His life was slowly
strangled out and he was left hanging.
while the mob proceeded to the county
jail where it is now preparing to storm
and capture Wilson. It does

not seem that the officers can successfully
resist long and the only hope is
that they may be able to save the second
negro by some ruse.
Wilson, it is charged, went to the Burgess
farm house while Mrs. Burgess was
alone and told her he was hungry.
While she was getting something to
eat he entered the kitchen door and
seized her. He fled, leaving her half dead.
Afterwards she managed to crawl to
house where she told
the nearest farm
her story. A posse of officers started in
pursuit of the negro and when Wilson
captured was hurried the

11 P. M.- The mob changed its mind bc-

and cut down the body of the negro,
whose name is Mayfield. They rushed it
to the public square and burned it in a
bonfire, hacking it to pieces with knives
as it burned.
Then they charged the jail and the
sheriff and deputies fired, wounding several

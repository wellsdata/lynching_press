, Pa.- Recently I
from the
the smug cold aloof manner
which these writers exhibited towards
this very serious question.
One of these writers, a reporter on a
southern white daily, wrote for the
New Republic a weekly magazine that
pretends to survey intelligently and
impartially the group and class prob-
lems of this country.
This individual had often seen with
his own eyes a mob in action. He
had often seen the terrible results of
the mob's blind fury. He had sen
the bullet ridden bodies of black men
outlined against the sky, while white
women and children exulted over the
glory and fruition of man's most bru-
tal passions.
He had seen the curious crowds that
afterwards thronged the cross road's]
store to get a glimpse of the dead
man's fingers or toes, or to hear the
intimate details of the achievement
which brought these trophies hither.
And having seen all of this our wri-
ter reflects deeply and comprehensive-
ly. Then, emerging from his state of
thought and meditation, he offers to
the world a "sure solution" of this
vexing problem.
"What South Needs"
What the south needs, he tells the
world, to civilize it and to keep it
from mobbing and burning and lynch-
ing the black man are groater oppor-
tuities and facilities for a more varied
lelsure! It needs, he specifios, more
autos more radios, more horse racing.
more movie houses, and more things
in general to interest and charm the
southern gentlemen and his family.
Negroes, he avers, are mobbed and
lynched because the mobbing and mur-
dering of black men affords a thrilling
out-door sport and pastime.
Negroes, on the other hand, will
cease to be murdered in this manner
when other recreational and pleasur-
able amusements are put within reach
of these naive fun-loving Nordics of
Georgia and Alabama.
But friends it's not nearly so sim-
ple as all that.
In the world of sport, just as in the
world of real life, what is one man's
meat is very often another man's pol-
gon.
What manner of amusement or sport,
for an example, could you offer to a
man who gets a thrill from setting a
torch to the pyre that encircles the
writhing body of a human being.
Why Lynching Power
Negroes are lynched and mobbed and
burned because lynchers and mobbists
are ignorant and bestial and uncivi-
lized.
They are mobbed and lynched be-
catuse laws against murder and ather
civilizational restraints, which ordin-
arily hold in check ignorant and be-
stial groups, are ineffective in the par-
ticular locality or where the lynching
takes place.
And yet this observer-philosopher is
not altogether in a class by himself.
A white woman writing in the At-
Jantic Monthly last month is, if any.
thing, even more irrational and hope-
less towards the maniacal fury of the
mob.
She recounts the action of a mob
in an Oaklahoma town a few years
ago when some forty Negroes
massacred, and according to her testi-
mony, just one lone white man was
killed.
were
Her account of this affair is written
in that pseudo subtle manner so highly
prized by some high-brow monthlies.
It is objective and detached to the
point of silliness. The writer strives
too hard not to show any feeling over
the matter that she ends by showing
less than the necessary capacity for
sympathetic thought and reflection.
The article goes into numerous details
about the white man's awful, albelt
brutal, power and the black man's mere
gesture of resistance. Then it stresses
the big-hearted goodness of a little
fringe of whites who hide a few Negro
servants in their protecting clothes
closets.
It even recites in detail the manner
in which brutal whites shot down fee-
ble old Negro men; how they burned
practically every house in the Negro
section, and left hundreds of women!
and children not only husbandless!
and fatherless, but without the privacy
of town that breed and nutured them.
clothes as they had grabbed in their
flight.
What, But No Why
Everything in a way is told about
what happened but nothing is told :-
bout why it happened. Not one word
is told about the kind of people who
did these things, or about the kind
of town that beed and nutured them.
Nothing is told about the white back-
ground that framed this unrighteous
outburst, and nothing about the bar-
barism which all along must have
been evident in men's ways of think-
ing and living.
Indeed not one word of enlighten-
ment is ventured about the low, brutal
ideas and ideals of the town's little
merchants and professional men,
about those narrow editors and equ-
vocating white preachers and leaders
who were in part responsible for every
single dastardly deed done
done on that
occasion.
No one knew just what to do about
such things. That is her empty, in-
ept conclusion.
No one knew and it should be fit-
tingly added that no one cared.
Christianity
civilization and
and
brotherhood trampled upon and flout-
edt
! Law and order, and the protective
an punitive powers of the state, de-
fled openly, derisively and with im-
punity.
Only the white man remains jubilant
and triumphant as he gloats over the
bruised and desecrated bodies of his
forty dead Negroes,
No one really knew just what to do
about such things:
Surely these evasive, meaningless
words carry their own sufficient indict-
ment of a writer who dared not to
tell the whole truth.

colored men, accused of being
implicated in the killing of
Deputy Sheriff James Gibson

day, were taken from the jail
by a mob to night and lynched
in front of the court house.
A first attempt to lynch one
of the men immediately after
their capture was frustrated
by the Rev. Perry E. Pierce, a
Methodist minister.
The mob dispersed but public
feeling was not allayed
and the mob reformed later,
with the announced intention
of lynching the two men, who
had been returned to jail.
When the prisoners had been
taken from the jail short work
was made of putting them to
death.
One of the men, John Fore
man, alleged to have been the
man who killed Gibson, was
wounded when taken into custody
and was not molested.
but the unwounded colored
man was seized by the mob,
which had grown to large pro
portions, and a parade thru
the principal streets began.
When the mob reached the
Methodist Church a large
tree offered the opportunity
which the rope suggested.
" Let's lynch the Negro on
holy ground!" shouted some
one. Rev. Pierce. attracted
by the screams, appeared and
pleaded with the mob not to
perpetrate the lynching, but
his effect did not save them.

infuriated mob of more than
500 persons stormed the county
jail here shortly after noon
today and lynched two Ne-
groes within two miles of the
city. After the bodies were
cut down they were thrown on
a burning brush heap and
cremated.
One of the Negroes, Frank
Kinley, was accused of having
attacked Mrs. Etta Rose last
Friday night. The mob took
him to the Rose home, two
miles from the city, and she
identified him as her assailant
. The other Negro, Jessc
Thornhill, was hanged because
he bodly declared that
he would have committed the
same crime.
The mob which lynched the
two Negroes formed early this
morning. With its ranks constantly
increasing as it marched
to the jail, the leaders demanded
that Kinley be turned
over to them. The sheriff
turned in a call for the police
reserves, Judge Reed of the
circuit court was also sent- for
he came hurriedly and addressed
them for more than
an hour, speakers from the
ranks of the mob came forward
and talked in the Ne-
behalf but they harran-
groes
gu√®d the crowd to finish the
task begun, rendering all aid
powerless in the face of the
mob's overwhelming numbers
All during the forenoon the
disorder and turmoil waxed
hot and many Negroes were
beaten on the streets. The
sheriff, in the meanwhile, had
tried to get his charge away
for safe keeping, but failed.
The climax was reached
shortly afternoon when the
mob broke the bonds of re.
straint and took out the Ne-
groes who were taken in automobiles
to the Rose home.
There Kinley was identified.
After they were hanged to a
tree the bodies were cut down
a fire started. The bodies were
thrown in the flames and more
wood piled on.
Then, its work completed

gled back the two miles to
city. the

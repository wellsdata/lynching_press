Springfield, Ill.- Two white men
were killed and one negro was lynch.
ed, more than half a hundred persons
were injured and two score of houses,
mostly occupied by negroes were
burned Friday night as the result of
Ian attempt by a mob to lynch a negro
who had assautled a white woman.
After a night of riot, arson and
slaughter, the state troops, called out
by the governor, succeeded early Sat.
urday in restoring a sembiance of order
. One thousand militiamen, in.
cluding three companies from this city
and companies from Bloomington, De
catur, Perkin and Pontiac, were set
patrolling the streets.
Despite the presence of the troops
another victim was added to the list
on Saturday night, when William Don-
igan, an aged negro, was killed. Doni
gan was a cobbler and respected as a
simple and inoffensive citizen. His
shop was within two blocks of the
state house. In the absence of a patrol
, the mob set fire to the shop and
the venerable negro was compelled by
the smoke to run into the street. His
appearance was greeted by a shower
of stones and bricks, and as he staggered
under the fusillade he was seized
and his throat cut. A rope was
then run through the wound and the
victim bound to a tree. There he was
found later, unconscious and dying.
The rioting was precipitated by an
assault committed by a negro upon
Mrs. Mabel Hallam, wife of a street
car conductor. While the woman
slept, alone in her home on a populous
residence street, awaiting the return
of her husband, the man broke into
the house, dragged her into the rear
yard and assaulted her. Before noon
George Richardson, a young negro,
was arrested by the sheriff's force,
victim
charged with the crime. The
partially identified the prisoner.
Crowds quickly gathered about the
jail, but Richardson was spirited
away to Bloomington for safe keeping
.
Balked of their prey, the members
of the mob wreaked vengeance upon
a restaurant keeper who had assisted
in spiriting away the suspected negro,
by completely wrecking his restaurant
and burning his automobile. Lewis
Johnson, a white boy, aged 17, was
killed during the rioting at the restaurant
.
After burning many houses in the
negro quarter the mob, which became
more and more despe: ate as the night
passed, finally gratified its thirst for
blood when Charley Hunter, a negro,
was lynched at the corner of Twelfth
and Madison streets, right in the heart
of the district called" Bad Lands."
Troops arrived at the scene too late
to prevent the lynching. Some of the
members of the mob declare that the
had shot two white
lynched
negro men.

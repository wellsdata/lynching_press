The Marshal of Saucier returned the
fire, wounding the negro, who was then
locked up in the town jail.
An attempt was made to lynch him,
but was prevented by the Marshal.
As it was feared that the mob would
return, the Marshal hurried the prisoner
away in the night, intending to
take him to the County Jail at Me-
Henry, which is safe against attacks,
but he was waylaid in the pine woods
by the mob and the prisoner was

BARELY ESCAPED LYNCHING
He had been arrested in Paris on
March 11 after the police throughout
France had sought him for several
months. A mob tried to lynch him
while he was on the way to the police
station.
He was known as one of the most
desperate criminals in the country.
During his incarceration he confessed
to the murder of Ducret and admitted
killing a postmaster at Bezons and a
railroad cashier at Les Aubrais, near
Orleans. A special guard was kept on
him in jail.
This morning while Lacombe was
talking with his lawyer in an enclosed
courtyard inside the prison
his guards stood a few yards off.
Suddenly Lacombe, who was an all
around athlete and a professional
former of feats of strength at county per-
fairs, sprang forward and grasped
the lower rungs of an iron ladder leading
to the upper part of the building.
He had clambered past tier after tier
of cells and had mounted swiftly to
the roof before the guards
from their astonishment. recovered

MYSTERIOUS MURDER.
The Body of a Jewess Found
in a New York Cellar.
A Mob of Would- be Lynchers,
Armed With a Cannon,
Repulsed by the Mayor of
Spartansburg, S. C.
A Ghastly Find.
NEW YORK March 10.- A mysterious
murder was discovered by Blurmah Levi,
a feeble, tottering woman 70 years old, in
the grimy cellar of No. 3 Eldridge street,
this afternoon. The murdered
one was
young, good- looking and evidently a
Jewess. The body was covered with
bruises and the skull fractured. Shreds
of human skin were found hanging in
light threads from her finger nails, mute
evidence of an awful struggle with her
murderer. No one had occasion to use
the cellar for six months before to- day,
Mrs. Levi going down to get a beer keg
to preserve pickles, discovered the body.
For the past year Mrs. Levi's son used
the ground floor as a place of business
and rented the floor above to two rich
Hebrews, who founded a Hebrew school.
Isaac Jacob, a crazy Hebrew, who recently
shot and killed Herman Rogozinksi, and
shot but did not kill Mrs. Rogozinski, and
when pursued shot and killed himself,
was janitor of the school. It was he
had a number of wives, and the police
think the murdered woman was one of
wives and he killed her before his
Jacob's onslaught on the Rogozinski family.

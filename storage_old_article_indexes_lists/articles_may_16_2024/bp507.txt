In reply. Governor Sholtz wired:
"The deplorable lynching which!
took place in Tampa early this
morning came out of a fair skyi

So there was no occasion or oppor-t
tunity to prevent it by the use of
troops. I have directed both the,
ther and the state's attorney to
make a speedy and complete in-
vestigation to the end that justic
may be meted out to these mu-
derers in accordance with the laws!
of the state and I will use every
power at my command to the end
that the perpetrators of this crime"
are punished and to prevent fur-'
the lynching in Florida.

THREATS AGAINST A NEGRO,
Ohio Farmers Said to Be Anxious to
Lynch Jefferson Kelly.
CLEVELAND, O., May 22.- A message
just received from Painesville says that no
mob has collected to lynch Jefferson Kelly,
the negro charged with assault upon Mrs.
Wilhelmina Tucker. Considerable talk
against the prisoner has been indulged in,
however, and it is said that masks and revolvers
have been displayed. No trouble is
anticipated unless a mob is collected after
the saloons close. Sheriff St. John is said to
have sworn in deputies, but the report cannot
be verified. It developed to- day that
Kelly attempted another assault on Sunday
morning before he was arrested. He met
Mrs. Chilson and her daughter, Mrs. Man-
chester, while they were on their way to
church. He tried to get into the buggy in
which they were riding, but he was beaten
off by the women.
COLUMBUS, O., May 22- A special to the
Journal from Painesville, says:" To- night
a big crowd of farmers have got together
in the country and, it is reported, will make
an attack some time to- night on the jail.
The sheriff is aware of the threats and is
said to be forming a posse of deputies to
guard the jail. He refuses to say anything
about the matter, but denies that fears
a lynching." he

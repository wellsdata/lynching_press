Rumored Lynching.
A report is in circulation that Alfred W.
Archer, basket maker, late of Milford, formerly
of this town, was recently hung in Westmore
land co., Virginia, where he had gone a few
weeks since to clerk for a man named Massy,
at a place called Royal Oak. He is represented
in the Del. Inquirer as an orderly, quiet
man, so much so that his friends did not know
what his party predilictions were, and adds:
" Shortly after his removal there a letter was
placed in the post office at Milford addressed
to him. The postmaster took this letter and
placed a slip of paper upon the outside of it, to
this effect:" Look out for him he is an Abolitionist
." This paper was intended for the eye
of the postmaster in Virginia alone. It did its
work, The postmaster communicated the fact
to man of his kidney, that a live abolitionist
was them, next
of a mob has taken him out and hanged him."
We give the above as we find it. There
good reason for discrediting the whole story. is

In 1894 there were 9,800 murders
committed and 132 were hanged. In
the same year there were 190 persons
Jynched, shot or burned, 166 of whom
were in the South and 134 were Ne-
groes. A few days ago the Democratic
house refused to investigate lynching
in the United States, claiming it had
no jurisdiction. The United States
turns its face away from the
crimes of its own to those of Armenia octociousness.

MURDERER NEGRO LYNCHED.
Taken From Jail by a Mob and Lynched
Yesterday.
Terre Haute, Ind., Feb. 26.- George
Ward, the negro who confessed to the
nurder of Miss Ida Finkelstein, was
taken from the Vigo county jail by a
mob at 12:36 o'clock today. The mob,
which had been once repulsed by the
deputy sheriffs with shotguns, broke
into the jail while the sheriff was at
the court house. A rope was placed
around the negro's neck, and he was
dragged to a wagon bridge across the
Wabash river, three blocks away, and
hanged to the draw bridge. A crowd
variously estimated at from 2,000 to
3,000 gathered at the jail immediately
after it became known the murderer
was under arrest. The mob used a
large piece of timber for a battering
ram and broke in the jail door and
with clubs guns and revolvers drove
back the few, deputies on guard.

A lawless reign of terror in the State of South Carolina in the
vieluity of the lynching city of Aiken is disclosed by the daring
investigation just completed by the N. A. A. C. P. Assistant Secre-"
dary, which brings to light the following startling facts:
1. The lynching was planned and executed by members of tho
Ku Klux Klan.
2., Officers of the law took part in the lynching and a number
of them aeted as "official executioners" of the mob victims.
3. The prisoners were turned oyer to the mob by the Sheriff
and his assistants, who were parties to the crime.
4. Reputable white citizens living in that vicinity are in terror
of their lives from the lawiess Ku Klux Klan ring, and go heavily
armed, bar their doors at night, and have been "praying to God"
for some person from outside the State to come in and bare the facts.

of a White man named. Hartley, 18 miles from Aiken. As a result of a
quarrel between, this man and another white man, the latter sought to
embaijass Hartley by notifying the Sherif that the Lowmans were selling
whiskoy. Ttalked with a number of white people and withoout exception
they declared that the Lowmans were an entirely industrious, law-abad-

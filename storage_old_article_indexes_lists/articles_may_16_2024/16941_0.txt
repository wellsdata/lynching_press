There were about 100 vessels lying at San
Francisco, entirely deserted by their crows.
Sailors were very scarce and wages were
from$ 100 to$ 200 per month. Nearly every
sailor that arrives runs away to the mines and
works a while, but soon returns to San Francis-
co to take a spree and spend his money.

none were needed:
There will be more specie sent to the

NEGRO LYNCHED.
Brookhaven, Miss., Feb. 10- Eli
Pigot, a Negro, who attacked Miss
Williams in this country a few
weeks ago, was taken from the custody
of a Jackson milliary company
and a posse of deputies and
hanged early to day. The military
company was overpowered by a
mob of more than 2.000 citizens.
A number of shots were fired and
two members of the mob were
wounded. Pigot was to have been
tried today for his crime.
The prisoner reached Brookhav-
en from Jackson in custody of
Sheriff Frank Greer, and under
the armed escort of the Capital
Light guards, ordered into service
by Governor Noel to protect the
Negro during the trial. When the
soldiers and Negro alighted from
the train the mob surged around
and a fierce hand to hand fight ensued
, in which fists were freely
used. The soldiers clubbed the
members of the mob with their
guns. The fight lasted five minutes
and the military started with
the prisoner to the court house,
when the mob, reinforsed and reorganized
. made another attack,
secured the prisoner, dragged him
to a telegraph pole and hanged him.
Captain A. L. Sairley, who commanded
the Jackson company, has
the affair to the governor
reported and is now awaiting orders.

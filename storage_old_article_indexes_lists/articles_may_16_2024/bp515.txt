Miss. To Extradited Are Assailants
Tennesseeans Request That Delta State Governor Give
His Assurance of Legal Procedure-Want Criminals
Punished In Proper Manner For Offense.
(Special to The Courier) Courier) The Special to
mob
were allowed to see the
alleged
admit-
criminals, they voluntarily
ted said confession in full, as is re-
ported in the daily press. The in-
terviewers noted that the desper-
adoes had not been beaten or mis-
authorities,
used by the police
which disclaims any pressure for
their admitting the crime. It is
learned that the three youths were
all employed and gave no reason
for their desperation. They show
no signs of fright or emotion and
hardly realize the untimely signif- !
:cance of their acts.

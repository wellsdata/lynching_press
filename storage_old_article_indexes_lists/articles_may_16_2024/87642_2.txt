MOB CAPTURES A NEGRO.
The Sheriff Begged Them to Be Good, but
They Wouldn't.
COLUMBIA, S. C., July 23.- Henry Gray, a
negro, was arrested yesterday at Ora for an
assault on the three- year- old daughter of one of
the citizens, and was sent to jail. Last night, by
order of the Judge, a deputy Sheriff started
with him through the country to catch a train
at Goldville, so as to take him to the penitentiary
here for safe keeping. A party of men
boarded the train early this morning from
Laurens. It was known they intended to lynch
Gray, and the Sheriff went along to attempt to
dissuade them. He tried to have the train run
by Goldville. The conductor refused, and Gray
and the deputy were waiting on the platform
as the train slowed down.
The lynchers jumped off with drawn pistols.
Gray broke away and ran. He was fired on,
wounded, and captured. The party started with
him across the country He has probably been
lynched..

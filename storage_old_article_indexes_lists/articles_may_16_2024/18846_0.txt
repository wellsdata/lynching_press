Hanged For Attempted Outrage.
( By the Associated Press.)
Camden, Ark., July 31.- After twice escaping
from the hands of the law, according
to word received here today, Lee
Newton, a negro, has been lynched in
Columbia county.
Newton was caught a month ago in the
room of two young ladies belonging to a
prominent Columbia county family. Their
screams brought quick assistance, but by
a desperate effort the negro escaped. He
was captured by the authorities but again
escaped. Last week the police located
him and with the aid of bloodhounds
captured him. Saturday night while
prisoner was being taken to jail at Mag the
nolia, a mob of 25 men set upon the es
cort and hanged the negro to a tree.

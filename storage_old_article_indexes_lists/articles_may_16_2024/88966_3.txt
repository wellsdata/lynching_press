One Lynched. One Shot,
James Scott, was struck by a stray
bullet and almost instantly killed. Af-
' ter burning many a house in the negro
quarter the mob became more
and more desperate and finally gratified
its thirst for blood at 3 o'clock
this morning, when Charles Hunter, a
negro, was lynched right in the heart
of" bad land." Troops arrived at
the scene too late to prevent the lynch-
ing. Some members of the mob declared
Hunter had two white men
during a quarrel in shot a saloon.

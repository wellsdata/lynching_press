Why Nobody Goes To
Church

I am in Sloux Falls, S. D. It is
Sunday, and yesterday and today the
newspapers were full of reports of the
latest lynch murder in Oklahoma. A
colored man was accused of raping
a white man's wife; the thing was
never proven. Have you not noticed
that they are afraid to bring such
charges into court? Yes, because they
fear something else may be proven.
But the "National Guard" allowed
itself to be "overpowered" by the mob;
then the officers allowed the woman's
husband to come into the pail and stab
the trapped and bound Negro to death.
This white man is not even being held
under bond.
Well, with all this big human news
in the papers, we "po' cullud fokes"
in Sioux Falls worked the dials of our
radios all Sunday morning, turning on
one great preacher after the other, in
many different cities, trying to see if
any of them were attacking this sav-
age situation. And what do you think?
There was not a word mentioned on
this subject by even the greatest fire-
caters or the mightiest "heavies" of
all the pulpits. But what were their
"texts" and "subjects of the morn-.
ing?" Here are a few of them:
"Brotherly Love"
"Christ in You"
"Foreign Missions"
"Civilizing China"
(China ought to sue for slander).
"Beyond the Veil"
"The Faith of Our Fathers"
Etc., etc.
Why, a poor listener from the moon
would have thought we were living in
an ideal world here. This is all that
the white preachers of America dared
to talk about, while the stench of Tex-
as and Oklahoma was offending the
nostrils of even the heathen gods.
And what were the black preachers
doing? If they had been broadcast-
ed, some of them would have been
discussing the following topics:
"The Railroad Train to Heaven"
The Gospel Ship"
"Dry Bones in the Valley"
"The Eagle Stirred Her Nest"
The Horse Pawed in the Valley"
And most pertinently of all:
"Death in the Pot"
And yet religious boards continue to
wonder why church 'attendance grows
smaller and Smaller.

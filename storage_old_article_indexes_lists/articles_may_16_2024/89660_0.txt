tion concerning why
They were directed to his farm and there
they arrested him and started back to Mis-
souri with him and Cornelia Street accompanied
them. Shortly afterwards papers
from Missouri arrived giving details of the
murder of Gilbert Gates by Alexander Jester
, and related the story of the long chase
the officers had to catch the murderer. Subsequently
the papers stated that the officers
had arrived with their prisoner and that a
mob was forming to lynch him. Nothing
further was learned of the case for twenty-
eight years, and it was supposed that Alex-
ander Jester had been killed by the mob.
Recent developments, however, show that
Jester escaped from the mob that was
forming to lynch him and was landed in
jail. He escaped and made his way into the
Indian Territory, where he was afterwards
joined by his, Cornelia Street. They
have lived there sister ever since.

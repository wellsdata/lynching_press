Lawlessness grows by what it feeds and
upon; and when mobs begin to lynch velop
for rape they speedily extend the
sphere for their operations and lynch first
for many other kinds of crimes, so woman
that two- thirds of the lynchings are went
not for rape at all; while a consider- to
able proportion of the indviduals
lynched are innocent of all crime. for
Governor Chandler, of Georgia, the
stated on one occasion some years of
ago:" I can say of a verity that I count
have, within the last month saved in
the lives of half a dozen innocent
negroes who were pursued by the
mob, and brought them to trial in a the
court of a law in which they were fused
acquitted." As Bishop Galloway, of
Mississippi, has finely said:" When

"
Governor Jelks, of Alabama, has recently
spoken follows The
as
lynching of any person for whatever
crime is inexcusable anywhere- it is
a defiance of orderly government:
but the killing of innocent people under
any provocation is infinitely more
horrible; and yet innocent people are
likely to die when a mobs' terrible
lust is once aroused. The lesson is
this:" No good citizen can afford to of
countenance a defiance of the statutes
, no matter what the provocation
. The innocent frequently suffer
, and, it is my observation, more
- usually suffer than the guilty. The
white people of the south indict the
whole colored race on the ground
that even the better elements lend
no assistance whatever to ferreting
is out criminals of their own color.
The respectable colored people must
learn not to harbor their criminals,
but to assist the officers in bringing
them to justice. This is the larger
crime, and it provokes such atrocious
offenses as the one at Atlanta. The
of two races can never get on until there
of is an understanding on the part of
both to make common cause with
law- abiding against criminals of
the any color."

Omaha, Neb., Sept. 30.- Mayor Ed
P. Smith was nearly lynched when he
refused to surrender William Brown,
colored, to a mob of bloodthirsty hoodlums
here Sunday night. The mayor
was strung up with a rope, the end
of which was thrown over a telegraph
pole. When cut down by policemen
he was unconscious.
The new$ 1,500,000 court house is
badly damaged, having been fired by
the mob when it was denied possession
of William Brown, who was charged
with a criminal attack on a white girl.
The mob, not satisfied with almost
killing the city's chief executive,
marched toward the home of Police
Commissioner Dean Ringer. In order
to get to the home of the chief the
mob had to pass through a colored
neighborhood. They got within three
blocks of the said Negro section when
the cowardly mob, led by more cow-
ardly leaders, thought that it would
be safer if they turn back. This they
did
Brown. is one of the many race men

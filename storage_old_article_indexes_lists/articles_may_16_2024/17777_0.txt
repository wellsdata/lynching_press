THE NEGRO BURNINGS.
( From the Springfield Republican.)
The ordinary negro lynching by
hanging no longer attracts much attention
. This is because it proceeds
in undiminished frequency, and also
because the method of burning at the
stake has come to be more generally
employed than formerly, and produces
horrors and agonies so much in ex
cess of the lynching by rope and
bullet that the latter tends necessarily
to the character of the commonplace,
neither startling to the country nor
sufficiently agonizing to satisfy the
savagery of the mob. But meantime
the lynching by fire in turn drifts to
ward the ordinary, and to such an ex
tent, that the discovery on behalf
of the mob of some new and more
awful way of inflicting slow death
and torture would seem to be demanded
.
When some seven years ago a negro
was burned at Paris, Tex., the whole
country was moved by the performance
and the newspapers employed
columns to describe the awful spectacle
, while comment on it extended
even to the European journals and
magazines. But within two or three
years burnings have become so frequent
as to draw only passing attention
. On Wednesday of last week a
negro was burned at the stake in Ala
bama, and on Saturday another, the
son of a well- known local colored
preacher, was burned in Georgia. And
these two affairs have received no
more attention in the news of the
country than the recent lynchings by
bullet and rope in Mississippi which
so worked upon the nerves of one innocent
colored man that he killed him
self to escape the torturing fear that
his turn at the hands of the white
mob might come next.
Is the country finally to come to the
point of accepting in silence all that
goes on in the way of expressing the
deadly race prejudices of white mobs?
The North has been silenced, so far
as the South is concerned, by recent
negro burnings of its own- in Colorado
, in Kansas and in Indiana. The
Alabama and Georgia affairs of last
week brought out a display of no
greater savage fury or eagerness to
secure from the garments and charred
flesh and bones of the victim souvenirs
of the ocasion than did the Terre
Haute burning in Indiana only a few
months back. The two sections stand
on a level in this matter, and neither
is now in a position to taunt the other.
And so a boasted Christian civilization
is evidently to submit in silence to
these repeated revelations of itself as
a ghastly mockery.
The plain fact of the matter is that
white hatred of people of a dark
color seems to be increasing in the
United States, and contempt for their
rights is at the
growing
moment a
quantity. How much this has been
stimulated by a national display of
disregard for the rights of so- called
inferior people we shall not under
take to say; but that something has
happened to stir white savagery to
unusual depths of ferocity in dealing
with the criminal black, and white prejudice
to renewed and broadened efforts
for race oppression, must
evident to all. be

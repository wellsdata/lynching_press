COLLINSVILLE(, Ill., April 5.-
Kneeling with his arms crossed, Robert
P. Prager, who was lynched by a mob
last night at midnight for alleged disloyal
utterances, prayed in German for
three minutes before he was strung
up, according to statements today by
members of the lynching party.
Prager was a coal miner and yesterday
at Maryville, Ill., in an address to
the miners on socialism, is said to have
made remarks derogatory to President
Wilson. Miners there became angry
and when they threatened to do him
bodily harm he escaped to Collinsville,
his home. Some of the miners, however
, followed him, collected a crowd,
took Prager from his home and led him
through the street waving an
barefoot American flag.

NEGRO PREVENTABLE LYNCHING
ARKANSAS GOVERNOR CONVINCED
LITTLE ROCK, Ark., May 5.( P)
-While a grand jury investigated
the lynching of John Carter,
negro, and subsequent disorders
by a mob here last night, Governor
Martineau ordered state
troops to remain an guard duty
in the city.
The order was issued after he
had summoned Mayor Charles E.
Moyer and Sheriff J. M. Haynie
to the capitol and discussed the
situation with them. While he
did not issue a formal statement,
he said he was convinced that
police and sheriff's forces could
have averted the disorders and
might have prevented the lynching
. The governor said it was not
within his province to remove any
officials from office even should
he believe their failure to act
justified.,
Carter it was hanged and riddled
with bullets by a mob of several
hundred men following his capture
in a tree near the city and
an alleged confession that he attacked
two white women yesterday
. Later his body was attached
to an automobile and dragged
through downtown streets and
then burned. A wild orgy of
rioting and indiscriminate gun-
firing followed. This was subdued
when state troops were ordered
out.
Severe criticism of peace officers
came from different quarters
today, daily newspapers carrying
editorials in which the city
and county law officials were
blamed for the disorders. Mayor
Moyer declared that decision of
the city council in not ordering
the police to attack the mob
probably saved the lives of
persons, 250

mob of United States soldiers, and hung on a
gallows erected upon the public plaza. Lin-
ton, it is said, was on board the United States
brig Somers when young Spencer was hung
by Commander McKenzie. The two men who
were killed were Achiles Centro, an Italian,
and band master of the fifth regiment of infantry
, and Don Pedro Carera, a Mexican. It
is alleged that the difficulty grew out of an
insult by Linton to the wife of the band master
. Linton, in attempting to shoot Centro,
killed Carera, who was endeavoring to quiet
the parties. Centro was killed at the
fire. second

A QUIET investigation into the Eatontown,
N. J., lynching affair has been going on since
its occurrence a few weeks ago, and has resulted
in the arrest of two or three" prominent
citizens," one of whom has confessed
that he was a participant. Jsrsey justice is
likely to be meted out to those who took the
law into their own hands as impartially as it
would have been to the wretch on whom the
mob worked its will." Hanging bees" will
not gain in popularity in that State if those
taking part in them are not allowed to go
free By the has ever heard of
. way anyone
,
investigation into the lynching of the
an Archers at Shoals?

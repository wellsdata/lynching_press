The mob during the process of lynching
observed order; none were allowed
to fire at him except the one.
A member of the mob made a brief
speech, in which he said they were
there with an unfortunate wretch, not
in a spirit of malice, but to make an
example of him and teach his race they
must the women of Frederick county
alone let.

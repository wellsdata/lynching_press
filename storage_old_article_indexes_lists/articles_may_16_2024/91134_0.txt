One of the strong
the movement is the Rev. A. Mark
Harris, pastor of the Union Street
Baptist church, Jersey City, N. J.,
who made the following statement
:
Recent disgraceful happenings
in these parts demonstrate conclusively
that the Negro problem is
no longer confined to the South.

broad land is the Negro safe when
thugs and hoodlums go on the
warpath. No one ever dreamed or
thought of the possibility of such
an act of savagery being committed
in the old Quaker commonwealth
of Pennsylvania, founded
by William Penn on Brotherly
Love. But it did happen, and on
the Lord's Day.
The quiet of that Holy Day was
broken by the multitudious howl
of a bloodthirsty crowd of demons,
disguised in the form of human
beings, led on to their ghastly work
by some of the so called best white
citizens of Coatesville, and unless
we rise up and vigorously protest
against the commission of these
barbaric deeds, the time will come
when the dying groans of a Negro
will be heard coming from the
flames of his funeral pyre, on the
very spot where Crispus Attucks
fell, and the fair name of Massachu-
setts will become a stench in the
nostrils of men.

will tell you that the only thing
lacking is some one brave enough
to lead the crowd, and the world
will be startled with the news of a
Negro burned in Broadway,' and
another about' Negro Lynched on
Boston Commons.' Washington,
the capitol of the nation, has tried
to' Jim Crow' the Negro; Balti-
more has its' Jim Crow' streets
Deleware has lynched Negroes;
Pennsylvania is stifled with the
smoke of a recent burning; New
Jersey joined the ranks some
years ago, when a minister preached
a sermon which resulted in the
lynching of a Negro; New York
City has for years refused to serve
colored men in certain places, and
the wave sweeps on like the rushing
of a mighty wave, leaving the
dead and wounded in its wake.

members of the Senate and the

and is in a state of anarchy.
If the men whom we have sent to
the Senate and to Congress fail
to do their full duty in bringing
about these reforms, we shall meet
them at the polls and defeat them.
Every race under the sun can
get a hearing at Washington and
have their demands granted but the
Negro race. We have sent committees
of ten, of twenty, of thirty
and of fifty, but they have been
looked upon as self appointed
leaders, and ere the door had closed
behind them, their appeal had
its way to the waste basket,
found and nothing was done. But when
five thousand of us shall march
up to the White House, after holding
a half hour prayer service in
every church in the capitol city,
there will be no question of leadership
. The world will know that
at last the race has decided to demand
its rights, and will not take
no for an answer.
It is certain that no one who has
red blood in their veins and a
conscience will say that they are
satisfied with the conditions in th s
country, of which we form no small
part, and for which we have given
our lives on the field of battle.
There are those who contend that
the white people of the South know
best how to deal with the Negro,
and that they are among his
friends. If to be hung to a convenient
limb and to be burned at
the stake are acts of friendship,
then may God deliver us from our
friends.
Although this movement had its
birth in a Baptist convention it is
by no means confined to the Baptists
alone. Indeed, it is a race
movement and we therefore call on
every man and woman of the race
to write at once to the Senator and
Congressman of their district, telling
them of the movement and request
them to meet our delegation
of five thousand at the gates
of the capitol, on the morning of
May 7 next, and head the line of
march up to the White House. It
is confidently expected that every
pastor regardless of denomination
,
will at once get in touch with
headquarters and arrange for
meetings to be held in their church
We have secured the services
of some of the best orators in the
race, and their voices will be heard
now until the close of the
campaign from.- New York Age.

Tuesday night given by the Ala-
bama Democrats in honor of Gest-
ner McCorvey, state Democratic
executive chairman. The 12 electors
of Alabama were special
guests and the dinner was at-
tended by approximately 400 persons
including ex- Goxernor Dixon

dy Ellis. Han-
Mr. Colmer spoke on" states
rights against civil rights", emphasizing
that this is a continuation
of the struggle started in
the formation of the Republic- a
strong central government as advocated
by Alexander Hamilton
as against local self government
as advocated by Jefferson. He
pointed out that the abolition of
the poll tax, anti- lynch laws and
FEPC are infringements on the
sovereign rights of the states.

Congressman and Mrs. Colmer
was Mrs. Hermes F. Gautier who
was introduced to the Alabam-
ians as the newly elected Missis-
sippi national Democratic committeewoman

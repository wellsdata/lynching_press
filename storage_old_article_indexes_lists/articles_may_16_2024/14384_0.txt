FRANK'S RING RESTORED
VICTIM OF MOB ASKED THAT IT
BE SENT WIDOW.
Unidentified Messenger Delivers It to
Atlanta Newspaper- Mother
Asks Forgiveness.
Atlanta, Georgia. It was Leo
M. Frank's last request that the wedding
ring he wore be delivered to his
wife. It is in the hands of O. B.
Keeler, a member of the staff of an
Atlanta newspaper, who is a resident,
however, of Marrietta.
A messenger, supposed to be a member
of the mob of lynchers, delivered
the little gold circlet at Keeler's home
Wednesday night with the following
note:
" Frank's dying request was that his
wedding ring be given to his wife.
Will you not see that this request is
carried out?
" This note will be delivered to you
by a man you do not know and who
does not know you Make no effort
to find out his identity.
" Your article in the paper of the
17th is good- very good.
" You are expected to destroy this
note after reading it."
The message was unsigned.
" God Forgive Them," Says Mother.
New York, N. Y.- The Nazarene
once said when he was dying on the
cross,' God forgive them, for they
know not what they do.' Some day
these men may know also. Leo told
me that after he had been condemned.
My only wish is that these men some
day may realize what they did. Don't
ask me whether I forgive them.
Some day maybe I can."
Sobbing and shaking from her grief.
the mother of Leo F. Frank, murdered
by Georgia lynch law, passionately reiterated
her belief in her son's inno-
cense and refrained from
her son's slayers. excoriating

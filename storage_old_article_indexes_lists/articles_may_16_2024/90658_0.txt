Guthrie, Ok .. November 18.- Both
Governor Ferguson and, United States

negro prisoners and appeals were made
to these officers for assistance in protecting
the prisoners, for the alleged
reason that the city officials refused
to act. No further particulars were
given. But the governor and the marshal
have taken the matter up by wire
with the county authorities and
ordered them Greer to do their duty.

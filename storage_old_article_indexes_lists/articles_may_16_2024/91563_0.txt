INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Jan. 28.- A special
to the Sentinel from Evansville, Ind.,
says: Cities and towns along the Ohio
kiver have begun a crusade against the
negroes. The entire trouble dates back
to the lynchings of the negroes at Rock-
port and Booneville for the murder of the
white barber, Simmons, at Rockport, one
night last month.
The Board of Safety of this city has ordered
the police to arrest all strange ne-
groes and bring them before the City Police
Judge. If they cannot give any reason
for being here, they will be sentenced
to the rockpile. The object of this order
is to rid the town of an obnoxious class
of negroes. It is estimated that there are
2000 colored men in this city who absolutely
refuse to work. They spend their
time in the colored saicons and low dives
of the city. The Board of Safety was
prompted to this step by the action of the
Spencer County Grand Jury in indicting
139 negroes of Rockport for selling their
votes on last election day. The citizens
have been actively at work for the past
month arranging the preliminary evidence
to be presented to the Grand Jury.
It is said an attempt will be made to have
the blacks who are indicted arraigned in
court at one time, and it is the desire that
they be sent to State Prison at the
time. same

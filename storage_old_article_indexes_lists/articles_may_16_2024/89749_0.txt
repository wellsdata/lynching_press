A Fiendish Crime.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Oct. 23.- One of the most
barbarious crimes ever perpetrated in this city
was committed last night by a colored man
named Cy Lafferty. He engaged in a quarrel
with his wife, knocked her down and beat her
to insensibility. The fiend then saturated her
clothing with kerosene, set fire to it, and left
her, making his escape by the back door of the
house. It was several minutes before the neigh-
bors discovered the woman's awful condition.
When the flames were extinguished her body
was burned to a crisp, and she died to- day. The
murderer is still at large. Lynching, in case
his capture, is freely discussed. of

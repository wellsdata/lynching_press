Trial Riot Tenn. Columbia,
COLUMBIA-Attempts to accelerate the conviction of
23 of 31 colored men facing charges of murder growing out
of last February's race riot here were halted sensationally last
week when defense attorneys motioned to nullify the indict-
ments on the grounds that Negroes were barred from jury
service.
The court judge, Joe M. Ingram,
is now hearing testimony of over
eighty-five witnesses summoned by
the defense lawyers to prove their
point. At press time, there had been
no ruling as to the acceptance of
the motion but District Attorney
Paul B. Bumpus has warned that
he will seek new indictments in
the event the present ones are
quashed.
Walter White, NAACP executive
secretary, indicated that his organi-
zation would call every one of ten
thousand Negroes in Maury Coun-
ty (scene of the trial) to show their
qualifications. He predicted that
such a routine would take two
months and would develop the
hearings into a nation-wide expose
of Tennessee malpractices.
Hint Other Legal Maneuvers
The defense attorney announced
early this week that if their mo-
tion is unsuccessful, they would re-
quest that the defendants be given
separate trials and that the hear-
ings be held in another city to in-
fairness. Deliberations
on
sure
these legal moves would take con-
siderable discussion and would pro-
long the trial.
Meanwhile in Nashville, a Fede-
ral Grand Jury is continuing an in-
vestigation of the riot facts to de-
termine if any federal law or con-
stitutional guarantee were violated
during the disturbance.
The furore created by the sur-
prise legal tactic caught attaches
at the court flatfooted and demon-
strated the efficiency of the staff
defending the accused men. This
staff, backed by the NAACP, in-
cludes Leon Ransom, Howard Uni-
versity Law School professor, Thur-
good Marshall, special NAACP
counsel, Z. Alexander Looby, and
Maurice Weaver, the latter attor-
ney of Nashville, Tenn.
Town Is Hotbed Of Racism
Some five hundred persons, the
Negroes,
majority
being
have
crowded the courtroom located on
the second floor of a drab, gray,
limestone building at all of the
sessions but there have been no
demonstrations.
A few feet from the courtroom
is a balcony where a mob lynched
a Negro nineteen years ago. Ac-
cording to Mr. Looby, Columbia is
only seventy miles from the origi-
nal home of the Ku Klux Klan in
Pulaski County and the mob spirit
has always been strong here. Ne-
gro citizens are said to have wit-
nessed two other lynchings and in
one the body of the victim had
been exhibited hanging from the
court house window in the main
square.
Witnesses Uphold Contentions
Twenty witnesses, all colored,
streamed through the witness box
during the day as the NAACP con-
tinued its efforts to show that
there are qualified colored persons
in the county and that these have
been barred from jury service
through "manipulation of jury
lists."
About one-half of the eighty-five
witnesses the defense plans to call
to prove system exclusion of quali-
fied colored persons from jury duty
Maury unty because of their
race or color had completed their
testimony last Friday night.
All except one testified that they
had never heard of colored per-
sons being called for jury duty in
Maury County. One witness, Sam
Carruthers, a school teacher, said
he has been summoned once, but
was excused at his own request.
Another, Loraine Morton, said his
nephew, James Morton, an under-
taker, had been summoned in a
panel once several years ago, but
was not placed on the jury.
Session Enlivened
High point of the Friday session
came when in opposition to ques-
tions hurled at Maury County Crim-
inal Judge W. C. Whitthorne, 88-
year-old veteran jurist of over for-
ty years experience, District At-
torney Bumpus shouted, "We don't
want another monkey law case in
Tennessee." He referred to the trial
of John T. Scopes 21 years ago at
Dayton, Tenn., on a charge of vio-
lating State law by teaching the
theory of evolution in the public
schools.
Attorney Bumpus continuously
objected to questions of defense at-
torney which pertained to social
inequality. Finally, Judge Ingram
sustained his objection and ordered
the topic discussion discontinued.

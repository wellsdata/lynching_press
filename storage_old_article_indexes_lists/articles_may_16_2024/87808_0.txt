SPRINGFIELD, Mo .. April 16- A
race riot is raging here as a result of
the lynching of two negroes, accused
of assault upon a white woman, yesterday
, by a mob of 1,500 persons.
It is now certain that the wrong
men were hanged, and the negroes are
rising to avenge the death of the colored
men. There is a large black
population in city and the surrounding
country this, and serious trouble
is anticipated. The city is filling with
armed white men, and Governor Folk
has called
out the militia, which is
How patrolling the streets.
Fourteen prisoners escaped while
the mob was taking the negroes out
of the jail to hang them. The negroes
stoutly protested their innocence, but
they were quickly strung up to a live
oak tree in a side street, after which
their bodies were riddled with bullets.
Governor Folk offered a reward
for the arrest of has members of the mob.

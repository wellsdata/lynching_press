Roosevelt Sees Turn Of
roup Toward UNAVA Body
CHICAGO, '111—Failure of the
of
American Legion and the Veterans
of Foreign Wars to speak out
against the post-wur lynchings
Negro veterans and the many at-
tácks against, them helps explain
why the United Negro and Allied
Veterans of America was formed and
why, Negro veterans are turning to
this organization for leadership, says
James Roosevelt, son of the lote
FDR.
This belief is stated in an article
by James Roosevelt in the current
issue of The Negro Digest, published
here, titled, "What Does the Negro
Veteran Want?"
After describing the alarm felt
by Negro veterans throughout the
country over lynchings and brutal
beatings of Negro veterans particu-
larly in the South, Roosevelt cites
the case of James Stephenson, Navy
veteran of Columbia, Tenn., who
was threatened with lynching, be-
cause he defended his mother dur-
ing an argument with a white store-
keeper who had slapped and kicked
her. He also refers to the brutal
quadruple lynching in Walton
County, Gcorgin, last July, one of
the victims of which, George Dur-
sey, was a former GI.
SAYS VETS ANGERED
"These two cases," Roosevelt
writes, "and many more have served
to anger and disgust many veterans.
especially Negroes as they take stock
of the democracy which they were
called upon to defend. It is noted
regrettably that neither of the two
major veterans organizations have
spoken out sharply in condemnation
of these attacks which are of park-
mount concern to Negro veterans.
"This undoubtedly helps explain
why Negro veterans have formed a
national organization under their
own leadership known as the
United Negro and Allied Veterans of
America, with Joe Louis, us the
honorary national commander."
Roosevelt points out that the Ne-
gro veteran wants the same things
any other veteran wants and has a
right to expect them after having
seen honorable service in the arined
forces of his country.

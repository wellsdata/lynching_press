A COSTLY SPORT
From the New York World.
The award of$ 2000 damages made by a South Carolina court
to the widow of a victim of mob violence establishes an interesting
precedent. In April, 1920, Joe Stewart, a Negro, was taken
from jail at Laurens, S. C., and hanged. Suit for this amount
under the constitutional requirements was brought by the widow
in the Common Pleas Court, and the Presiding Justice directed
the jury to return a verdict against the county for the full sum.
The damages fall considerably below the valuation at which a
human life is held in some other states, but the point is that
they are assessed against the county authorities for failure to
protect a prisoner from the mob. If it is going to cost even
$ 2000 to lynch a Negro in South Carolina, it is conceivable that
the price may prove a deterent to lynchings. It may be, indeed,
that the precedent will materially affect lynch law in the South
and elsewhere by impressing public officials with a keener sense
of their responsibilities. Perhaps there will be less negligence
in preventing mob attacks on jails if the county has to pay for
them, and pecuniary considerations may work a reform
moral suasion has failed to accomplish. which

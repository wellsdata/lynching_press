NEGRO CONVICT
LYNCHED IN GA.
Tried to Escape, Shot Down One
Guard and Attempted to Kill
Two Others.
Cochran, Ga., March 22.- Homer
Howell, a negro convict, was lynched
yesterday afternoon after he had killed
the guard, Joseph Coody, and attempted
to shoot down two other
guards, in a convict camp, a mile outside
of this town.
Howell and sixty others, it is said,
plotted to escape.
Howell felled Coody with a shovel
and, securing the revolver secured
from the clothes of the dead man fired
on two other guards. Neither were
injured, but both returned the fire.
Howell fell to the ground with a bullet
through his body.
None of the other convicts attempt-
to escape. The authorities here
were notified and aid was sent to the
camp.
Howell was guarded by the deputy
sheriffs, and was being taken to
Hawkinsville when a mob of fifty men
covered the officers with guns, took
the prisoner, and strung him to a telephone
pole and riddled his body with
bullets.,

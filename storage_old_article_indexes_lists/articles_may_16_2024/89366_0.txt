ANGRY MOB LYNCHES
NEGRO MURDERERS
Louisville, Ky., January 17.- That Jim
West, one of the three negroes taken from
the Shelbyville jail by a mob Sunday
morning escaped being lynched, and that
Gene Marshall, convicted of murdering
a woman of his race, met death at the
hands of other negroes, is stated in a
special to the Herald.
According to this story, the mob of
about 60 men was composed of about 40
whites and 20 blacks. After the cell door
had been broken in and West, Marshall
and Wade Petterson taken out, the white
men took possession of West and Patter-
son, turning Marshall over to the negroes
in the mob. That Patterson attempted
to escape and was shot down by the mob
before he could be hanged is generally
believed in Shelbyville, and the fact that
no trace has yet been found of West
leads to the belief that he escaped.
Marshall's body found hanging to
a bridge. was

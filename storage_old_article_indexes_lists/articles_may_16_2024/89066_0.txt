Indianapolis, April 22- One negro
was shot and fifteen men arrested
in the attempt of a mob of
2,000 men to take William Ray,
old, from the
19 years
negro,
county jail, where he is
Marion
held for the murder of 14- year-
old Martha Huff, a white girl.
Leon Harris, negro, was struck in the
neck and left leg, when he was pursued
for several blocks through the city
streets by a crowd of approximately 500
white men
fired
. Ten shots were. He
was taken to the city hospital. His condition

John K. Gray, 39 years old, Louisville,
Ky., was arrested for carrying concealed
Weapons and shooting within the city
limits. The pollce say he shot at Har-
ris. Fourteen men were arrested for dis-
orderly conduct and inciting a riot.
The mob began forming early in the
evening, and when a crowd estimated at
300 men marched down West Washing-
ton street at 8:30 o'clock an attempt was
made to reach the jail, which was guarded
by a large force of police armed with
riot clubs. Most of the men were from
the neighborhood in which the girl lived.
The police dispersed the mob, but it rallied
in the county courthouse yard. It
was not until almost midnight that the

of leadership is believed to be the reason
no attack was made on the jail.

the night's events. Prosecuting Attorney
Adams promised an early trial for Ray,

Oklahomans Plan
Prosecution Of
Half-Wit's Killers
OKLAHOMA CITY, June 26-
(A. N. P. via telegram servica)—
Twelve white men have been iden-
tied as members of the mob who
recently lynched Henry Argo, a half-
wit youth, in Chickasha, and Negroes
here and throughout the state are
going to see that every effort is made
to convict them."
This fact became known Sunday
nighi: when 'a large group of citizens
headed by Dr. ¿W. A. J. Bullock,
president of the local chapter of the
NL A. C. P., `assembled in the
off of the Black Dispatcch, Roscoe
E Dungee, editor, to formulate defi-
Alte plans to aid in the prosecution.
This conference was devoid of ora-
tory and meaningless prattle but was
devoted to action.
Plans for the solloltation of funds
throughout the state were made.
Special counsel, composed of Attor
neys J. 2. A. Harrod and Layniê
Harrod, both veteran criminal law-
yers, will be employed, and the gov-
ernor of the state will be petitioned
to change venue as it is not believed
that a conviction, can be effected in
Chickasha.
Attorneys here have stated that
all of the rioters are guilty of mur-
der under the Oklahoma Conspiracy
Statutes and the citizens are deter
mined that those men whose sav
agery caused them to lynch an in-
nocent youth and cast à blot upon
this whole stato be tried and convict-
ed of murder. Many have rallied to
the cause, and it is believed that
others throughout the state will join
hands with them.
Another important development in
the case centers around the proposed
Bult by the relatives of the slain.boy,
for damages against Sheriff Mat
Bankey, which will be Aled in the
Federal Court. Sankey is charged
with being drunk at the time the boy
was killed and ther:fore violated the
oath of office.

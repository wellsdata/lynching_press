EVANSVILLE, Ind., Sept. 3.- Sheriff
Thomas, of Posey county, arrived here
this evening with Dan Powell, colored,
whom he saved from a mob by escaping in
a buggy. To- day William Carr, a prominent
citizen of that place, was fatally shot
by Web Thomas, a negro, who escaped and
is now being hunted by enraged citizens.
A mob then turned to the jail to lynch
Powell, who shot an officer a week ago,
and is under penitentiary sentence, but the
outwitted the mob. Feeling against
negroes sheriff is running high at Mt. Vernon.

CALLS SOLDIERS BUMS; GETS
PRISON
" Dirty bums," remarked Joseph Reik
as a party of soldiers passed by in Ho-
boken, N. J." I hope they drown before
they get to France." The insulter
fled when
a group of young men
,
shouting" lynch him," started in his
direction. He was captured, arraigned,
convicted and sentenced to a year in
prison, while held back a
mob intent on policemen lynching.

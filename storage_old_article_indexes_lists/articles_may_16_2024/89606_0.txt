Georgia Negro, Who Shot
Sheriff, Taken From the
Authorities by Mob
and Hanged
Americus, Ga., June 21.- William Red-
ding, a negro who shot and perhaps fatally
wounded Chief of Police William C.
Barrow here tonight while the officer
was taking him to prison, was taken
from the jail shortly afterwards by a
mob of about 500 men and hanged to a
cable at a street corner near the scene
of his crime. The mob was unmoved
by the pleadings of a local pastor in Red
ding's behalf, and after swinging the
negro's body in the air, they riddled it
with bullets.
Early in the night Redding, after being
arrested by Chief Barrow, suddenly
wrenched himself loose from the officer,
pulled a pistol from his pocket and fired
at close range. The bullet passed en-
tirely through the officer's body and
wounded a negro bystander. Chief Bar
row, although badly wounded, fired several
times at Redding, three other negroes
receiving slight injuries. Redding was
placed in jail, but a mob quickly formed,
overpowered the sheriff and deputies, tied
a rope about the prisoner's neck and led
him through the streets to a prominent
corner, where he was strung up. After
firing at the swinging body for about half
an hour the mob dispersed, and at a
,
late hour tonight the body had not been
down
taken.

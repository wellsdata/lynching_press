We are called upon this week to record
one of the most heart rending tragedies
that ever occured in this State. On-
Thursday night, the 30th ult, Mr. Pearce
residing about five miles from this place,
while he was eatng supper told one of his
negro men, who had been guilty of some
misdemeanor, that as soon as he was
through he would give him a flogging.
Accordingly, when he got up from the
table, he went out into the back yard and
called the fellow out of the kitchen and
told him to come to him. Manifesting a
great deal of submission, he obeyed; but
so soon as he got within striking distance
drew an axe, and split in twain the head
of his master- scattering the brains in
every direction. We are not aware he
survived a minute. The negro instantly
fled, and up to this time( Friday noon
has not been captured. Mr. Pierce was a
good citizen, a kind husband, father and
kind master, and was beloved by all who
knew him; this, his melancholy fate, has
cast a pall of gloom over our whole com-
munity The
. negro beyond doubt.-
,
will be captured before many hours. If
he is, although we admiro submission to
the course pointed out by the law of the
land; in this oase so much of the brute
has been manifested, we would be glad to
see our citizens rise en mass and avail
rascal without
court jury" Madison

Mob Violence Is Branded As "The White Man's Burden" Burden" Man's White The As" Branded Is Violence
U.S. Most Murderous
Of Civilized Nations,
Kelly Miller Claims

WASHINGTON, Jan. 25-The late Mr. Dooley used to
say that the trouble with the Negro is that he is too easily
lynched. To paraphrase Mr. Douglass' expression: "The
race that is lynched easiest is lynched oftenest.

outcry against the barbar
groan. But on thoughtful analysis,
it readily appears that the white
man is the greater sufferer from
the mob malady, albeit the Negro
bears the heaviest brunt of afflic-
tlon. The reactionary effect of the
rabies of race hatred which prompts
lynching is well described by the
poet, Goldsmith, in his well known
lines on A Mad Dog:
"This dog and man at first were
friends,
But when a pique began,
The dog to gain some private enda
Went mad and bit the man.
The wound it was both sore and sad
To every Christian eye,
And while they swore the dog was
mad,
They swore the man would die.
But soon a wonder came to light
Which showed the rogues they.
lied;
The man recovered from the bite;
The dog it was that died."
an
The victim in the long run suf-
fers less damage than the doer of
leed. The white man is
in charge of the machinery of gov-
ernment and in responsible to the
judgment and conscience of the
world for the maintenance of law
and order. America is the most
murderous and blood thirsty nation
on the face of the earth which lays
claim to civilization. Its reputation
is tarnished and its fair name stig-
matized by the prevalence of these
barbarous and inhuman practices.
America at one time sought to pose
as the moral monitor over the con-
science and character of the con-
duct of other nations, but her
hands, reddened by the blood of
thousands of helpless vict.ms who
have perished without th
law
estop her from such higa presump-
flon. Germany which we would like
fo outlaw by reason of her barbar-
ity against the Jews, hurls back the
wift confounding rejoinder. "There
is no such thing as the lynching,
mutilation and burning of human
beings in Germany such as abound
in your country." White Americans
can only hang her disgraced head
in shame.
There have been 1500 white vic-
tims of the mob during the past 50
years. White men-even white
women, have been burned at stake.
The recent lynching and burning of
two white men at San Jose, Call-
fornia, was as atrocious and hor-
rible as any occurrence in the whole !
red record of lynching. If not a
single Negro had been lynched dur-
ing the past half century the white
victims alone would be sufficient to
make imperative drastic anti-lynch-|
ing provision. It is sometimes boast-
ed that this is a white mans civil-|
ization. If so the whites had bet-
ter be looking after it leat it be de-
stroyed by the continuance of these
barbarities.
Hitherto efforts to this effect
have been inspired mainly by the
Negroes and the well meaning
whites as if they were acting altru-
istically in behalf of the suffering
race. The Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill
was sponsored chiefly by Negroes
and was defended and defeated
chiefly because it was looked upon
as a Negro measure. Qn the other
hand it should be the highest con-
cern of American statesmanship to
blot out this stigma from the na-
tion's escutcheon and vindicate its
fair name in the eyes of the world.
Material recovery upon which the
energies of the nation are now fo-
cusing are certainly not of greater
importance or consequence than
moral recovery without which ma-
terial prosperity can be of endur-
ing value. It is as reprehensible to
condone rape or kidnapping in or-
der to condemn'lynching as it is to
condone lynching in order to con-
done the real or alleged cause
which evokes it. The rapist has no
race, the criminal no color. They
are the common enemy of mankind,
and should be isolated and deleted
as such. The crime of the mob is
no remedy for the crime of the man,
however heinous or atrocious that
crime may be.
The most hopeful sign above the
horizon is that the white race is
beginning to relieve the Negro of
the sponsorship and proprietorship
of this greatest of all moral re-
forms. The white women of the
South are leading the way. They
constitute the element in whose be-
half the iniquitous practice is re-
sorted to, but have magnanimously
and heroically discarded the inef-
ficacy of the drastic remedy and
repudiated the genuineness of the
motive behind it.
President Roosevelt, using the
moral authority of his high office,
has appealed for the mobilization
of the conscience of the nation to
roll away this national reproach.
Under such leadership and sponsor-
ship, backed up by those who suf-
fer most, it cannot fail to produce
the desired result.

AN ATTEMPTED ATTACK ON THE REBEL. PRISONERS.
Great exertions were requisite yesterday to prevent the
mob of disorganized soldiers and the rabbie from maltreating
or murdering the Confederate prisoners, and it
was necessary to rescue them by patrols of dragoons. In
ono instance a Senator informed General McDowell that
he had seen the mob with his own eyes hanging a prisoner
, and that gallant and generous officer at once
rushed off, if he could not rescue at least to averge
the" rebel," but on arriving at the place he
was happy to find he was in time to shield the man
from the violence of the crowd, and that the Senator had
mistaken an" efligy" for a human being. Gen. McDowell
has been much distressed by the dastardly conduct of
some of the beaten troops towards their prisoners, and
there have been strange scenes in consequence." General
," said one man," had I known this I would have died
a hundred times before I fell into these wretches' hands.
Let me go free, and let any two or four of them
venture to insult me then!" The soldiers
are,
however, greatly irritated not only by defeat, bat
by reports of the most horrible cruelties and atrocities
towards prisoners and wounded by the Confederates; indeed
, if it should be the case that the latter burnt an hospital
at Centreville with all the wounded, and that they
cut the throats of captives and dying soldiers on the fleid
of battle and in the retreat, the indignation and disgust of
the whole civilized world visit them, and their
cause will be marred more should by such vile cowardice and
blood- thirstiness than ten such victories could advance it.
For one, I am leth to credit these stories, but it is only
right to say that are many such current, particularly
in reference to there the New Orleans Zouaves.

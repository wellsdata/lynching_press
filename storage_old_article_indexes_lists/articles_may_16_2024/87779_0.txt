LYNCH
MOB HART'S KIDNAPPERS
SAN JOSE, Nov. 27,( AP)- A
mob, which had been repeatedly
repulsed by tear gas bombs during
the evening, while police reinfor-
cements were sought from other
cities, finally battered down the
jail door and rushed Thomas H.
Thurmond and John Holmes, con
fessed slayers of Brooke L. Hart,
down the street to St. James
Park. Both were badly beaten
and almost unconscious. They
were stripped naked. Thurmond
was unconscious when hanged.
Holmes resisted and managed to
throw the rope off his neck, but
it was forced back after he was
severely kicked.
The hanging was witnessed by
a jeering crowd of six thousand.
The sheriff, William Emig, was
taken unconscious to the hospital.
He was beaten about the head by
the lynchers. They first took the
wrong men from the jail, the interior
of which was reduced
wreckage. to

More Crime: Less Graft.
Although it is too soon to obtain the
the actual statistics of crime in 1911,
the impression in very general that
America is still passing through a wave
of violent crimes, thuggery, arson,
sault and murder. Mob murder was as-
commonplace in the news, and while
the lynching of negroes occurred mainly
in the south, there was no more depraved
form of that crime against society
than that exemplified in the
burning of Zack Walker, a drunken negro
murderer by a Coatesville, Pa.,
mob last August. There the efforts of
the state to punish the mob leaders
proved fruitless, owing to the unwillingness
of ju ies to conviet.
There
were manifestly fewer instances
of political graft exposures,

to the rousing of new civic
ideals. Of course, there were a number
of legislative bribery cases, like
that exposed in Ohio, and of election
frauds, like those uncovered in Balti-

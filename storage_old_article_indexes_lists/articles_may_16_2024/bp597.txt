boy. He was beaten severely before
being returned to the cell.
Shipp was selzed and hanged from an
elm tree in the courthouse yard. Smith
was thrown from the third floor of the
| jail with a noose around his neck and
strangled.
After the lynchings, the mob con-
sidered driving the two thousand col-
ored resident of Marlon out of the
city and burning their homes. This
action was deterred by the arrival of
police reinforcement from adjacent
cities.
Dr. W. T. Balley and Rev. William
Oglesby, state leaders of the National
MARION, Ind-Indiana will ask the death penalty for one of three
colored men implicated in the fatal shooting of a white man and the
attempted assault upon his 18-year-old girl friend, while more than a
thousand members of the mob that lynched the other two last Friday night
will go unmolested through the streets of this strong-hold of the Ku Klux

Prosecutor Harley F. Hardin an-
nounced Friday that no action was
planned to bring the members of the
mob to justice, but asserted that the
September grand jury would be asked
to indict Herbert Cameron for the mur-
der of Claude Deeter. 23.
After Abraham Smith. 19. and
Thomas Shipp. 18, had been taken by
force from the jail and lynched, Cam-
eron and Robert Sullivan, held on a
robbery charge, were spirited to the In-
diana State Reformatory to save them
from the possible afterglow of the all
too slowly dying embers of the Ku Klux

Marlon is the seat of Grant County
and is in the northeast central portion
of Indiana, fifty miles from Ohio on
the east and one hundred miles from
Michigan on the north.
Despite the presence of the sheriff's
forces and the police strength of this
city of 23,000, the mob was permitted
to enter the jail and to batter down cell
doors with sledge hammers without
the firing of a single shot by the police

Notice of the holdup was given the
police who very shortly arrested Shipp

HANGED TO A TREE.
A Rurly Negro Lynched by a Mob in
Florida.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Sept. 27.- Lee
Bailey, the negro who committed an assault
Friday night upon Mrs. J. R. With-
erell about a mile from McLane, was
lynched last night by a crew of indignant
citizens. Mrs. Witherell identified him
readily. He would have been strung up
at once but she pleaded for him and
wanted the law to take its course. A crowd
gathered at the jail and took the keys away
from the jailer and overpowered the
sheriff, took Bailey out and hanged him
to a tree. At daybreak the coroner's jury
viewed the body and rendered a verdict
that Bailey came to death at the hands
of" unknown persons his."

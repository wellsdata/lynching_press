But the damage to life and property
in dollars and cents is negligible
compared to the loss of public
confidence in the chief executive of
a state which boasts as high a culture
as the state of California. Governor

recent lynching in San Jose of the
kidnappers and murderers,
two

and devote a few moments to serious
reflection of the event and deter
mine whether he is entirely satis
with the way the affair was
handled fied.

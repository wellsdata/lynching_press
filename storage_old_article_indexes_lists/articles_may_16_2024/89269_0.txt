THE MURDERER MAY BE LYNCHED
Marshalltown, Ia., June 20.- A coldblooded
murder occurred at Union, just
across the line in Hardin county, last
night, the particulars of which have
just been received here. Mel Clemens
and Will Burguff, two young men of
that town, have been bitter enemies
for some time. Last night while Bur-
guff was sitting on a box in the street,
Clemens came up and struck him on
the head with a steel bar, knocking
Burguff off the box. Clemens then
threw himself upon the other and
stabbed him in the eye with the bar.
His skull was fractured and his brain
penetrated by the bar. The victim
lived only two hours. In a short time
a mob formed and attempted to take
the murderer from the officers,
but Clemens was finally placed safely
in the county jail at Eldora, Ia., after
an exciting run across the country. It
is said Clemens threatened to kill Bur-
guff. Lynching is feared and the
is carefully guarded. jail

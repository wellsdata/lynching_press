to the Illinois Central yards to escape lieve
the crowd of excited pursuers who in-

He was removed from the scene of his
attempted suicide without molestation.
Then the crowd collected about the jail,
and for a time it looked as if the lynch- Trinity
ing would take place. The desperate ment

attempt, and the crowd retired. Then tion
the officers took the wounded murderer
for
hurriedly away in a closed carriage.
Their supposed destination is Decatur.

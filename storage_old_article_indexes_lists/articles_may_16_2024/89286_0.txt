The exciting hunt for the Polk county
( Iowa) murderers ended in a lynching after
all. A recent dispatch from Harlan, Shelby
County, says that" between 1 and 2 o'clock
a. m., a body of men estimated all the way
from thirty to 100 in number, went to Har-
lan from the southeast and quietly tied
their teams on the bank of the river.
The men were led by some one of military
experience, as could really be seen by their
formation and the precision with which
everything was done. Marching directly to
the jail, and in the meantime posting out-
guards, they called upon Deputy Watkins for
the keys He made some objections, when
they seized him, secured the keys and proceeded
to the cell where Hardy was secured,
without trouble. He met his executioners
calmly the door, not a muscle or tremor
showing at that he had the least fear.

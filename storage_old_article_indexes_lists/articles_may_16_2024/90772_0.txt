BARNSTABLE Mass., Aug. 10-,
Sheriff Rosenhtla tonight asked for
state troops to help guard the county
jail here where three negroes are held
on charges of highway robbery and
asault upon a young white woman.
He had received a report that a party
of negroes was being organized at
Onset to come here and try to free
the prisoners.
Fifteen men were on guard to assist
the sheriff as a precaution
against a renewal of the attack
made possible on the jail early today by
a mob which threatened to lynch the
negroes. Late tonight there were
few persons in the vicinity of the
building.

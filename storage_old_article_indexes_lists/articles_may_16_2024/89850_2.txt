WHITE SOLDIER GETS THREE
YEARS AT HARD LABOR
ACEM
Throwing Bottles at Negro Soldiers
Was the Cause.
CAMP MEADE, Md.- Brigadier General
Gaston announced that Walter
Middleton, private of company B of
the Seventeenth infantry, had been
sentenced to three years' confinement
at hard labor, to dishonorable dis
charge from the army, and to forfeit
all pay, on the charge of" engaging
in a riot on July 24, 1918, by throwing
bottles at negro soldiers." The
trouble which resulted in the arrest
of Middleton and other members of
the Seventeenth infantry and some
negro soldiers took place at the canteen
in the W., B.& A. station at the
camp. A white soldier accused a negro
soldier of jostling him, and then
it is alleged Middleton threw a bottle
at a negro soldier. Things began to
look serious for a time until the military
police broke in. The affray had
some of the people ducking. Other
soldiers, both black and white, have
been arrested in connection the
affray. with

They have handed down the name
of Attila the Hun as the" scourge of
God." But when we meet Attila in
the spirit land we will have to get
down on our knees and humbly apologize
to him for the insults to his memory
. William of Prussia, when he
shuffles off this mortal coil, should
there be any," Elysian Fields," 88
pictured by Dante, will be very lone
some. His very soldiers, sailors and
officers will shun him. However, as
we believe neither in the Elysian
Fields or purgatory, we are afraid if
he goes into the presence of God with
his soul dripping with innocent blood,
he will hear a doom not to his liking.
It is strange how God brings strange
things to pass.
Here in America and in the southern
part, if a negro dares to raise his
hand to strike a white person, even
in self- defense, or under the greatest
provocation, his life pays the forfeit
in the most horrible manner. Now
they are drilling negroes and sending
them thousands of miles to kill
whom? White men. Strange, is it
not? Such is the working of Providence
.
We, as negroes, feel proud of the
fact that our boys are not only in
labor regiments and are mess attendants
, but every time we read the papers
and see where the American soldiers
are in the thickest of the fight,
we rejoice to know somewhere our
black boys are helping to kill the
cruel Germans.
4 When this war is over, will the
negroes still be denied the ballot?
Will they still be lynched and insult
led?
We are reminded of the fact that in
the first six months of this year 38
negroes have been lynched and wom/

How is that for justice and democracy
? And all in the face of the fact
that relatives of those lynched are on
the firing line. Still we are not thinking
of these things. We are forget
ting for the time being at least the
miserable Jim Crow cars we are paying
good money to ride in. We are
only remembering that America is
fighting for her life, and, like good
Americans, we are fighting side by
side with the bravest of the brave and
we are letting the enemy know that
we are in the fight to win V
After the war is over, will America

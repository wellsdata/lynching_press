miles this side of Eaton, they were halted
by a large body of armed men, and after
several pistol shots from both parties, the
negro was forcibly taken from them, and
hurried off through the woods, leaving the
parties who had him in charge to make the
best of a bad bargain. It being dark, pursuit
was impossible, considering the overpowering
numbers of the unknown parties
who had taken the prisoner. The negro
was found suspended by neck to a tree
at the side of the road the the next day."

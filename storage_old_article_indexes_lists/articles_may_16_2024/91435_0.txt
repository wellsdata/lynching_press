ROANOKE, Va., Sept. 20.- Robert Smith,
a negro, to- day assaulted and nearly
killed Mrs. Henry Bishop, wife of a well-
to- do farmer of Botetourt county. Mrs.
Bishop was at the market with a load of
produce and Smith bought a box of a
at
grapes. He asked her to go with him to
get the money and taking her to a house
nearby locked the door and bound her.
Then drawing a razor he demanded her ject
money. She gave it up, and while doing
so jerked the razor from his hand. The
negro then choked her, threw her down,
and pounded her head with a brick, leaving
her for dead.
Mrs. Bishop shortly afterwards regained
consciousness and returning to the market
told of the outrage. Detective Bald win
soon arrested the negro. An excited crowd
attempted to take Smith away from the
officer and lynch him, but Baldwin with
the prisoner on a horse dashed away at full
speed and soon had him behind the bars.

A crowd gathered around the jail and increased
as night approached. At 5 o'clock
the Roanoke light infantry marched to the it
jail by orders of Mayor Trout.
Gaards were posted and the streets in
About but
the immediate vicinity cleared.
dark the crowd was increased by a hun- the
dred men from the vicinity of the woman's
home, headed by Mrs. Bishop's son, a fire- a
man on the Norfolk and Western railroad.
At 8 o'clock portions of the mob battered
at a side door of the jail where the militia
and Mayor Trout had retired.
Being refused admission the mob commenced
to shoot and the mayor was shot
in the foot. The militia were then ordered
to return the fire and a volley from about
twenty- five rifles was poured into the mob.
It is thought that about five men were
killed by this fire and as many more
wounded, some of them fatally.
During the excitement caused by the vol- ing
ley the negro was taken from the jail by
an officer and secreted. The dead and for
wounded were removed to a drug store and of
to offices of physicians. The militia then
the
left the scene as quietly as possible.
The following is a list of the dead and
injured: Dead: S. O. Viell, hotel pro- the
prietor; Will Sheetz, fireman on the Nor-
this
folk and Western railroad; Charles W.
Whitlire, conductor on Norfolk and Western

Several speeches were made after the
militia had retired and Judge Woods of
the Hastings court assured the mob that let
Smith had been removed from the jail and
accompanied two of the crowd through
the jail to prove the truth of his statement
. This, and the speech of J. Allen It
Watts, the democratic candidate for the by
much to
state senate, did pacify the
crowd. But they hung around the jall
and adjacent streets for several hours afterwards
, many dispersing to search for
the secreted prisoner.
At midnight the scene had quieted down to
and no further trouble is expected. The
militia remain under the mayor's orders,
although it is probable that they will not
be called again. Mayor Trout declares
that he will out uphold the law.

AFTER THE LYNCHING.
The Citizens of Denver in a Decidedly
Panicky State of Mind.
Denver was in a very nervous condition
Thursday, the day following the lynching of
the murderer, Arata. The sheriff's force and
the police department, after having shown a
disposition to let the mob run the city for
fear that if they resisted some one might get
burt, was unusually active. Large numbers
of deputies were sworn in, the firemen were
armed, and all were ready for a bloody fray.
In addition to these forces the local militia
companies were kept under arms prepared to
quell a riot. Bodies of policemen patrolled
the streets and ordered the crowds to" move
on." Squads of militiamen were placed on
guard at the People's Bank Building and at
the Brown Palace Hotel. This was due to
rumors that an attack would be made upon
M. J. Lawrence, president of the People's
Savings Bank, who had been charged with irregularities
. The gun stores were also well
guarded.
In spite of the many rumors the night
passed without incident and there proba-
bly be no off further lawless outbreaks.

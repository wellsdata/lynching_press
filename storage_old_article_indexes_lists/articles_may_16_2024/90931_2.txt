LEBERG'S BAD RECORD.
Had Been in Prison and in Utah Insane
Asylum.
Cripple Creek, Colo.- The records of
the county jail show that Lars Leberg,
a young Swede, was sentenced to a
ninety- day term September 6th for assault
on the person of Tom Gallagher,
section foreman.
Leberg had worked a few days and
when discharged by Gallagher demanded
his money. When told to report
at the company's office in Cripple
Creek, he knocked Gallagher down and
then, arming himself with a shovel,
marched Gallagher to the depot.
A warrant was sworn out, and Le
berg, when found that evening by Constable
Veak, assaulted and severely
kicked that officer. He was overpowered
after a hard fight, in which two
police officers and two constables took
part. Revolvers were used to beat Le
berg into submission, and the police officers
were suspended pending investigation
by the Fire and Police Board as
to alleged cruelty. They were fully exonerated
.
In the county jail Leberg, morose
and threatening at times, was found to
be a moral pervert and was shunned
and feared by his jail associates. One
day when in a communicative mood
Leberg confided to a fellow prisoner
that he had been recently brought from
the Utah State Insane Asylum at
Provo, where he had been confined, to
Leadville by a warden of the Utah asy.
lum, who turned his adrift on arrival
in that city. Leberg at the time was
believed to be lying. His discarded
coarse underwear, marked in plain
characters" Leberg," was to be seen at
the jail this morning.
Leberg was released when his time
expired, December 7th, and all trace of
him was then lost. The name and description
of the man as enrolled on the
jail records is as follows:
Lars Leberg, aged twenty- two;
height, five feet nine inches; light complexion
, smooth face; nationality,
Swede; convicted September 6th, asSault
time, ninety days; discharged

A Negro Lynched.
Benjamin Thomas, colored, who attempted
a criminal assault on a little 8-
year- old girl, Lilly Clark, at Alexandria,
Va., on Sunday, was taken from the jail
there on Tuesday night, and after being
shot was hanged to a lamp post.
All day long Alexandria had been in a
state of pent- up excitement. Knots of
men gathered on the street and discussed
the affair, but it was hardly thought that
Thomas would be lynched. When night
fell, however, the crowd grew, and by 10
o'clock a throng numbering several hundred
people had gathered about the jail.
Demand was made for Thomas, but the
jail guards, who had been reinforced by
10 extra officers, refused. A heavy plank
was then procured, and the outer door of
the jail, which is an antiquated structure,
was battered in.
The officers made a brave resistance to
keep the mob out, but they were overpowered
and the outer corridor of the Jail
war quickly in possession of the mob. A
heavy iron door, however, stood between
them and the cell where the man was
supposed to be. This was also forced and
the mob surged in.
Thomas was at last secured and a rope
was thrown about his neck and several
shots were fired into him and he was
dragged to the corner of King and Fair-
fax streets, in the heart of the business
section of the city and strung up to a
lamp- post just as the clock on the City
Hall struck midnight.
The mob fired more shots into the hanging
body, and the leaders, after being satisfied
that he was dead, dispersed.
The body, from which all the clothing
had been torn, was cut down by the police
after hanging about 15 minutes, and
is now in the morgue.
The lynching is condemned by many in
the city, and it is believed that had the
negroes not on Monday night made
threats of what they proposed to do if he
lynched, he would not have been
harmed was.

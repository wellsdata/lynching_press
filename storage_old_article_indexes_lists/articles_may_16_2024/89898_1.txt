FEAR OF ABDUCTION FOR
DISSECTION PURPOSES
CAUSES GREAT ALARM
Baltimore, Md., March 31.- Riddled
by shots and probably mortally wounded
, W. A. Schott was captured after a
desperate three- hour battle waged
from a barricaded house. Two policemen
were wounded in the fracas and
another Negro, mistaken for the hunted
man, was shot three times by policemen
and beaten by a mob before
it was learned he was not the man.
The belief, which the police say is
current among Negroes of the city,
that white physicians are abducting
colored persons for dissection purposes
, was by the authorities to
be responsible held for the trouble.

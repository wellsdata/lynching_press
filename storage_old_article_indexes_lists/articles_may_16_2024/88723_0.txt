HALF HEARTED.
If the sheriffs who only half- hearted-
ly resist lynching parties, or the counties
in which lynchings are allowed to
occur could always be made to pay
damages, there would be fewer cases of
the rattle- headed acts of vengeance
which make victims of innocent people
and those against whom there is
mere suspicion. The sheriff of an In-
diana county has just settled a case for
damages out of court by the payment
of$ 4000 to the widow of one of five persons
, suspected of horse- stealing, who
were taken from jail and killed by a
mob. Ohio is discouraging lynching by
vigorous prosecution of the
of mob law.- Springfield Republican dispensers.

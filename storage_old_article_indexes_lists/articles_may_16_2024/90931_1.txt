BENT COUNTY MURDER.
Crime That Led to Las Animas Lynching
.
Las Animas, Colo. -Before the
lynching of Leberg Thursday night
there came stories about Leberg
which made feeling more bitter. Leberg
had been employed as a grader on the
Fort Lyon storage canal and a few
days ago attempted to kill another
man with a crowbar. So incensed were
the men working in the camp at his
actions at that time that he was
driven out and toi√° never to return.
Then came the stories from the
ranch of George Purvis, where Leberg
ate supper the night of the murder. Le-
berg went into the home of Purvis,
where he demanded and was given supper
. While at the table he was surly
and threatened to make trouble. He demanded
lodging, but Purvis was afraid
to have the man in the house.
He offered Leberg blankets and a
place to sleep in the barn, but this did
not satisfy him, and he went away
muttering. Later he built a camp fire
on the bank of the river, and then he
came back and set fire to a haystack
which he thought belonged to Purvis,
to get revenge.
The haystack that he fired belonged
to Lanvenmeyer, and the arrest of Le-
berg by him was followed by the unprovoked
killing of the farmer with the
hammer which Leberg secured from
the saddle of the victim's horse. Not
satisfied that he had killed his victim,
Leberg went back and securing knife
almost
a
from the victim's pocket
,
hacked his head off. He then took$ 30
in money and a gold watch and chain
from the person of the man he had
murdered, and rode away on his victim's
horse.
When he was captured he expressed
no remore for his act and even boasted
that he had killed a great land owner
who refused to give him a place to
sleep.
Then came one more detail that
added to the horror of the crime and
the fury of the men who sought to
avenge the murder of Lanvenmeyer.
When Sheriff Brown questioned Le-
berg, the prisoner told the officer that
he had drank of the blood of his victim
. To the sheriff, too, he openely
boasted that he had killed a man who
would not give him of what he had.
He said he was an anarchist and that
the land owners ought to be killed.
All of these things the mob knew,
and knowing them, it did not pause
until the perpetrator of the most re-
volting crime ever known in the
kansas valley was dead. Ar-

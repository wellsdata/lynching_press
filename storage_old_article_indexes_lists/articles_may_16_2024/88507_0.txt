TROUBLE IN CHICAGO
Mob Wanted to Lynch a Negro- Saved
by Police
Chicago, Aug. 16.- William Fiku, a negro
from Nashville, Tenn., came dangerously
near being lynched in the street tonight. He
snatched a pocketbook from a woman and
led the police a long chase through alleys
and down- town streets. During his flight
he fired three times at the police, and the
crowd which followed the officers in the
pursuit. He was finally captured in front
of the Great Northern Hotel, where he
crawled under a horse which was standing
by the hotel entrance. While the officers
were taking their prisoner to the police station
they were followed by a crowd fully
500 strong, which shouted," hang him,"
" lynch him,"" take him away." The officers
halted at Madison and Clark streets
to await the patrol wagon, and the crowd
made a desperate effort to take Fiku from
them. Ropes were procured and if the negro
had been taken from the police he certainly
would have been hanged. The police
used their clubs vigorously, and managed
to get the prisoner to the patrol wagon
which made a successful dash through
crowd. the

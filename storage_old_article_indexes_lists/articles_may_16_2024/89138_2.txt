Force of Show Officers' By
Macon, Ga., Mob is Calmed
TWO WHITE MEN ARE SHOT BY
AN INSOLENT NEGRO, WHO
WALKS BETWEEN LADIES AND
THEIR ESCORTS.
Macon, October 6.- Charles Adams and
William Solomon, prominent young white
men, were shot by a negro and seriously
injured at the Fair grounds tonight. The
Midway was thronged with hundreds of
young people. Adams and Solomon were
escorting two young ladies when a negro
in a very offensive manner forced his way
between the couples, separating them. A
remonstrance from the young men led to
an encounter, when the negro whipped
out a revolver and opened fire on Adams
and Solomon, both receiving wounds in
the stomach
Adams was. not seriously wounded, but
Solomon's condition causes much apprehension
.
The negro was promptly arrested and
placed in jail. A general stampede ensued
among blacks and whites as friends of
the wounded men made threats of vengeance
. A mob of 200 soon formed and
surrounded the jall, which is now being
stormed with vigor.
It is said that the outer door has been
broken down. Strenuous efforts is being
made to prevent violence, the Mayor Ã©xer-
cising all the power at his command to
restore order.
During the excitement at the park
Pierce Bronson, a negro, fired a 38 calibre
pistol at Luther Howard, colored, the
ball passing through his heart. This last
shooting was the result of a quarrel just
before the tragedy at the park.
1:30 a. m.- The mob at the jail is becoming
less demonstrative as the negro
they seek has been placed in the bar-
which is well guarded. This fact
I racks becoming known had a quieting effect.

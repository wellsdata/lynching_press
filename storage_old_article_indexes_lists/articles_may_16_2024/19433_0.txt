Columbia, S. C., May 5 .-( Special.)
Much excitement was caused in Chester
last night by the reported gathering of
a mob at Loweryville, about 7 miles from
Chester, for the purpose of lynching Jim

home of Mrs. Nellle Smith, a highly respected
and aged widow. Governor Hey
ward was requested to send troops to

arrival of militia probably prevented
lynching of Montgomery. the

A Cherryvale, Kansas, special says:
A German named Breckman has been
hurried to the Oswego jail from the
Bender settlement to prevent his being
lynched. Neighbors found his 18-
year- old daughter in the barn unconscious
. Her father, it is alleged,
ruined her, and then beat her into
insensibility. Later in the day she
died. An angry mob tried to lynch
Breckman, but the sheriff spirited
him away. Breckman was suspected
many years ago of being implicated
the Bender murders. in

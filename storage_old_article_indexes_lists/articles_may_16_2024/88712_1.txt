" The published statistics accepted
generally as re'iable, show that last
year there were 69 lynchings in the
United States. Of these lynchings,
55 were negroes and 14 were white
people. This is 6 more negroes and
11 more whites than were put to death
by mobs in 1914. Included in the
record are three women. In not less
than four cases it was demonstrated
after the lynching that the persons
put to death were innocent of the
fences charged." of-

Cingmars and Musgrove, two tramp
desperadoes, were traveling northward.
according to their own story, to the
wheat fields of North Dakota. A few

was issued for the arrest of the men,
who by this time had disappeared.
Sheriff Rogers took the papers himself
and started in pursuit of the desperadoes
. Just at dusk on the evening of
June 20 he overtook the two men five
miles south of Glencoe. Riding up to
them he said:" Boys, I want you to go
back to Glencoe with me."" Well, we
don't have to go," said Musgrove, as he
brought a Winchester rifle to his shoulder
. Before Sheriff Rogers could say
another word the tramp began firing on
him and he fell down, his body pierced
with five bullets. Twenty- four hours

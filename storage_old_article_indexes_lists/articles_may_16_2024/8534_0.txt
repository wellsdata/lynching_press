CONCERNING CALIFORNIA.
Kearney and Kalloch Criti-
cised- Vigilance Committee
Approved.
New York, 11 .-- The Times says: Kal-
loch, who was elected by men of the
sand lots, vehement'y declares that no
violence is to be feared from those who
are usually classed as Kearneyites, and
that the vague insinuations and open
charges contained in the address of the
Citizens' Protective Union are false and
slanderous. Thus the issue between the
chief municipal officer of San Francisco
and the substantial and peaceful citizens
is clearly drawn. Kall ch's sympathies
are avowedly with the creatures who
counsel the hanging of prominent busi-
ness men and the institution of a reign of
Lynch law. This complicates the difficulties
of the situation and increases the
risk of a violent collision,.
bluster. It is safe enough since there is
no intention on the part of anybody to
prevent Kalloch and Kearney from saying
whatever they like. It is not in the
least likely, however, that after the warning
they have received either of them or
any of their confederates will take any
practical steps towards abating the
nuisance of Chinatown means of mobs
of hoodlums to- day. by

As THE war news becomes dull
the lynching of negroes starts up
again. Since we have law sufficiently
strong to punish crimes of
all sorts there is no justification
whatever for lynch law. Snatching

, shooting and burning them
before they are given an opportunity
before a judge and jury to
prove their innocence may become
a spark some day that will set a
disastrous blaze burning.- Star

About the same time a number of boarding
house runners, thieves and villains of
low degree, surrounded Colonel Lippard,
denouncing him as a thief and pickpocket,
assailing him with every vulgar epithet
known to the vocabulary of the vile, and
calling upon the Metrrpolitan police to eject
him from the place.
Four men wearing the uniform of the
police then ayproached Colonel Lippard
with drawn bludgeons and belligerent attitude
, and he might then and there have
been clubbed, slungshotted, and
stabbed, had he not made good his perhaps retreat.

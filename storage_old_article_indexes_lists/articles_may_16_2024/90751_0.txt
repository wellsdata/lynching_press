A Lynching in Tennessee.
Nashville, Tenn., March 17.- At Tip-
tonville, in Lake county, last night a
mob hanged Ike Fitzgerald to a tree
near the court house. The negro was
charged with assault on a white girl,
Miss Mina Davenport, nineteen years
of age, and a trial jury had just reported
that they could not agree and
had been discharged. A different verdict
had been expected and a mob seized
the prisoner before the sheriff could
hurry from the court room and
hanged him him to a tree.

The Ohio Legislature has made a law
giving to the family of any one executed
by lynch law the right to claim heavy
damages from the county in which the
lynching occurred. There ought to
be some redress for the outrageous
lynchings which occur in some Western
and Southern States. If a law
like this were made general in the
States where such outrages occur it
might have the effect of diminishing
them in
. It is true most cases that
the lynchers are not property holders
or tax payers, but they are the dependents
of wealthy men who approve the
dastardly deeds when done by others
which they are too cowardly rather
than too law abiding to take part
themselves. in

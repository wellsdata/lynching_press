UNIONTOWN, PA., April 22.- The coke
strike yielded another pathetic murder
this morning. At Frick's Adelaide
Works, across the river in Dunbar town
ship, Deputy Sheriff Crawford and a
posse who sought to make a lot of evic-
tions were stoned and driven back by a
mob of Hungarian strikers. A subsequent
requisition, through Sheriff
McCormick, brought Company C, Tenth
Regiment, with 50 men. Then, with
the military drawn up in line, the evictions
proceeded to the end.
About 4 o'clock one family re- entered
a house, and when the sheriff attempted
to put them out a second time a mob assembled
and beat him and his deputies,
The leader of the Huns tapped his is
shoot Ameri
can!"
The sheriff grappled with him and
,
Deputy Crawford coming to his assist-
the head with
his revolver.
The Hun now started to run, and the
sheriff sped after him a
stone. When he was nearly within
reach of him the Hun's sweetheart, a
girl of about 17, ran between him and
the sheriff. Just then two shots were
fired, and the girl fell. Two women
came to her side, she got up and walked
with them into a house, and in a few
minutes afterward she was reported
dead. Deputy Crawford thinks her
lover fired the shot in trying to shoot
the sheriff.
Another shot was fired, which cut
Sheriff McCormick's thumb.
The Huns claim Deputy Crawford
killed the girl, and got a constable to
arrest him for murder; but he had three
prisoners to bring to jail and the arrest
was waived. It all occurred in a few
moments, while Company C was at the
lower end of the village eating lunch.
The first of a series of strikers' mass
meetings to be addressed by Socialistic
was at
afternoon. About 4,000 men attended
it. Alexander Jonas was the speaker.cow
He delivered addresses in German and
English. Pointing to the stars and
stripes, he said:" Under that flag John
Brown was hung, Parsons and others
in Chicago were assassinated and your
brothers at Morewood murdered. I
choose the red flag because it represents
the pure blood that flows in the veins
of honest workingmen."
John Delaber and several others followed
in a similar strain.
There are 500 or 600 Italians on their
way here, and they will be stationed at
both the Frick and McClure works.
About 500 Pinkerton detectives altogether
have been brought into the region
and distributed around the different
works where the most strenuous
orts are being made to resume. ef

mob entered the county jail here
early today, secured two negroes,
Crecle Mose and Mat Chase, and

which had been guarding the
jail for the past three days, were
relieved at midnight, and the
citizens formed a mob immediately

Mose Hill and Chase

and killing Deputy Sheriff Mark
Huffman and wounding Constable
Alex Cargill a few days
ago while raiding a crap game.
No arrests have been made.
The mob numbered 40 men,
and battered in the north wall of
the jail, grabbed the keys from
the jailer and rushed the trembling
blacks to the street. They
were taken four blocks south of
the jail to Pope's pasture, where
they were hanged. Chase made
a desperate attempt to free him

lynched with the other.
Jesse Jefferson, one of the ne
groes implicated in the shooting,
was left in his cell. The mob
proceeded about its work in an
manner, and there was
orderly little excitement.

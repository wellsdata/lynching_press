TO PROBE LYNCHING
IN CHOCTAW COUNTY
Governor O'Neal to Investigate
Lynching of Negro
by White Citizens
Montgomery, December 11-( Special.)-
Following telegraphic instructions from
Governor O'Neal, Second Assistant At-
torney- General T. Howard Seay left
Montgomery tonight for Butler, in Choc-
taw county, to investigate the lynching
of Azariah Curtis, a negro who met his
death at the hands of a mob in Choc-
taw county last Friday morning.
Curtis was lynched for the murder of
B. B. Bush, a prominent white citizen
of Choctaw county. Shortly after the
killing Curtis was arrested and lodged
in the Choctaw county jail at Butler,
where he remained for several days.
Early last Friday morning a mob composed
of about 200 persons took Curtis
from prison and strung him to a tree
limb, riddled his body with bullets and
left his dead body suspended in air.
Two other negroes had been arrested
with Curtis in connection with the crime
and after the lynching occurred they
were transferred to another jail for safe
keeping.
When the report of the lynching
reached the governor's office letters were
at once sent to Sheriff B. M. Locke of
Choctaw county and to Probate Judge
W. H. Lindsay, asking for an investigation
of the affair.
It is understood, however, that the
information that reached the governor's
office was of a meager nature, and as a
result Assistant Attorney General Seay
was sent to investigate the lynching.
Should it be shown that the Choctaw
officials were in any respect guilty of
neglect of duty in regard to the affair
it believed that the governor will
institute is impeachment proceedings.

" Not thine the bigot's partial plea,
Not thine, the zealot's ban;
Thou well cans't spare a love of thee
That ends in hate to man."
We close with this obvious moral
which we would now especially impress
upon all our friends, who seem to
think all the other churches are getting
so liberal, there is not much more work
for our church to do. So long as such
an article as" The Logic of Lynching,"
can appear upon the front page of a
prominent religious paper, it must be
evident that our church has plenty to
do in protesting against the horrors of
" Oldschool" creeds, and promulgating
its own faith. J. A.

MURDERER WAS LYNCHED
Young Farmer Taken From
in Asotin, Washington Jail
He Had Confessed to the Murder of
the Girl Mabel Richards- A Black
Cap Was Placed Over His Head By
the Mob and He Was Left Hanging
to a Telegraph Poe.
Asotin, Wash, Aug 5.- Despite the
efforts of Sheriff Richards of Asotin
county, father of the victim, who had
sworn in 25 deputies to guard him,
William Hamilton, a well- to- do farmer,
the self- confessed murderer of little
Mabel Richards, was forcibly taken
from the Asotin county jail early today
and lynched by a mob of over
1,000 men from all parts of Asotin
county.
About 12:15 o'clock this morning a
band of masked men, their faces concealed
with handkerciefs marched up
,
the street to the county jail.
The officers and guards were swept
aside by the mob. When the cell containing
the guilty man was reached no
key could be found to fit. It was ne
the bars.
cessary to saw What Ham
ilton said probably will not be learned.
After 15 minutes' delay he was dragged
out of the cell and down into the
yard.
Meanwhile, another company of
masked men had marched up the
street and taken position opposite the
jail. They kept back the crowd which
had filled the all night. Soon
there came a procession streets from the jail
yard. On each side of the prisoner
was a masked man clutching the murderer's
arm. Beside him another masked
man pressed closely, with his hand
over the murderer's mouth to prevent
a possible outcry. Other members of
the jail storming mob came behind. As
the group came forward those who had
been guarding the entrance formed a
chain about captive and captors, and in
this manner they proceeded, keeping
the crowd at a distance. At First and
Fillmore streets they halted under a
guy wire which crosses the street and
connects electric light poles. Here
one of the leaders asked Hamilton if
he wanted to confess. He did so, admitting
that he outraged the sheriff's
child, 11 years old, and then killed her.
His words were not heard more than
ten feet away. Finally he asked that
his jewelry and some trifling trinkets
be given to his father and mother. It
was promised that this would be done.
Some of the mob thought hanging
good and wanted to torture him,
But the original program prevailed.
Some one produced a black mask
lik that used in a legal hanging and
it was put over the head of Hamilton.
It reached down to his shoulders. A
rope was then placed about his neck
and thrown over the guy wire. It was
seized by many hands, the body was
lifted off the ground and suspended at
a h√©ight of about four feet. The doomed
man began to gasp for breath and
his efforts were plainly discernable a
distance of two blocks. When life was
extinct the rope was made fast to the
telegraph pole and the body left suspended
The crowd immediately dispersed
..

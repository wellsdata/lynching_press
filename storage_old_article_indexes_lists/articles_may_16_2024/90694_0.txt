Negro Hangs Mob
When Jury Fails
To Name Penalty
[ Republican A. P. Leased Wire]
VERSAILLES 13.
, Ky., March
Richard James, negro, charged with
the murder of B. T. Rogers, and Homer
Nave, at Midway, October 8, was
taken from the Woodford county jail
by a mob early today and hanged from
a tree, two miles from this city.
The mob, composed of 50 men, came
here between one and two a. m. by
automobile. A guard was placed
around the jail and four men went to
the door, aroused the jailer, took his
keys and went to the negro's cell where
they overpowered the prisoner after a
short struggle in which a blackjack
was used. James was taken in a machine
to the tree and hanged.
The trial of the negro ended Satur-
day night when the jury reported it
was unable to reach a verdict. The
had decided that James was guil-
jury ty, but could not agree on the penalty.

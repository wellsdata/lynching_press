In Springfield, Mo., several
weeks ago, a colored man was
caught in the private room of a
white woman. The meeting seemed
to be mutual, and they both
were arrested. The colored man
was fined$ 10 and the costs of the
court, for being there, and the woman
was turned loose. At the
trial the woman said she had sent
for the man to go on an errand for
her. The judge seemed to believe
woman had
this tale. This same
already caused the lynching of a
young colored man at Mt. Vernon,
Mo., last August. She having
been caught seeing the best
way out she hollowed and rape. There
are many such cases as this happening
every day in the year, but
no one seems to care to investigate
hence the colored man is lynched,
burned, and it is hurled to the
wind that he has committed an es-
sault upon some reputable
woman. white

JOE LYNCH KNOCKS
OUT KID WILLIAMS
Philadelphia, Jan. 29.- Joe Lynch,
of New York, knocked out Kid Wil-
liams, former bantamweight champion
, in the fourth round of what
was to have been a six- round bout
here tonight.
Williams was the aggressor in the
first and second rounds, but his blows
seemed ineffective. At the beginning
of the third round Lynch landed
a hard right to the jaw which sent
the former champion to the mat for
the count of one, Although game to
the last this blow had a telling effect
on Williams.
The New Yorker kept up his heavy
work in the fourth round, landing
rights and lefts almost at will. He
finally hammered Williams to the
ropes, where the former champion
staggered and slipped to the floor,
At this point his seconds threw a
towel into the ring and the referee
stopped the bout

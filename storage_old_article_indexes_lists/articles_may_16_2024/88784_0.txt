MOB LOSES PRISONERS.
Three Negroes Captured at Homestead,
Pa., Narrowly Escape Lynching.
Pittsburg, Pa., Sept. 8.- Prompt action
by the police authorities prevented
a probable lynching at Homestead.
Early Sunday morning four negroes
broke into the residence of William
Marsh, a prominent picture dealer of
Homestead, for the purpose of robbery
. They entered the sleeping
apartment of Mr. Marsh's three daughters
, and upon discovery they fled.
One of them, Isaac Mills, jumped from
the second story window and was so
badly hurt that he will probably die.
The others were arrested soon after
and placed in the lockup. The feeling
against the negroes was intense
and a crowd of above 300 had planned
to lynch them, but the police officials
smuggled them out of town and
them safely in jail in this city. lodged

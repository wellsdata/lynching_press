Murderer A Lynched.
On Wednesday last, Charles Patterson
shot and killed B. W. Porter, chief herder
of Bosler's cattle on the North Platte
thirty miles north of Sidney, Nebraska,
where Patterson was taken under arrest.
Last evening the jail was broken into by
a mob of masked men and Patterson
strung up to a telegraph pole. The
Sheriff overpowered the crowd and cut
Patterson down in time to save his life.
At four o'clock this morning was
again taken out and hung till dead he.

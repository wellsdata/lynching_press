Mob's A Vengeance.
Dan Smith, a negro 22 years old, was lynched
very unexpectedly at Pulaski, Tenn., the past
week. Some six weeks ago Smith assaulted a
white orphan girl with intent to commit rape,
was detected, arrested, and with some difficulty
in escaping mob violence, was landed in jail at
Nashville. He was quietly taken from Nash-
ville to Pulaski for trial, and without any ado,
was sentenced to 21 years in the Penitentiary.
No sooner wee sentence pronounced than a
mob rushed into the court- room, seized the
prisoner and dragging him pell- mell through
the streets, to Richland bridge, swung him off.

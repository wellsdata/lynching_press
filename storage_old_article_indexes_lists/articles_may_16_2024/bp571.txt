INDIANA IS
UP TO ITS
OLD TRICKS
MARION; Ind., March 13 The
second trial of one of the alleged
mob murderers who lynched. two col-
ored men in Marion, Ind, has
sulted in an acquittal, according to
Mra. W. T. Bailey, of this city, preal-
dent of the Indians state conference
of branches of the National Associa
tion for the Advancement of Colored:
People.
The verdict was returned): . Mrs.
Bailey reports, "in the face of evi-
dance given by the chief of police,
two police reporters and two news-
paper reporters, all of whom testi-
Bed that the man being tried was. a
member of the mob and helped in
the actual breaking into the jail as
well as yelling and shouting to the
Imob to come on.
The jury was out 21 hours and
we were warned not to be in the
courtroom when the verdict was
read, as in the event of a conviction
hell would break out, and they in-
tended to get us first. Needless to
say, the doctor closed his office for
the afternoon and together with Mr.
Pickens we stayed in the courtroom
until evening.
"For two nights during the trial
they made a bedlam of our alley,
shooting and back-firing,", and on
Thursday a white woman called over
the telephone to tell us to be very
careful, as the taxi drivers were go-
ing to attempt to get us. Mr. Pick-
eps says he could never have under-
stood what we had undergone if he
had not been here six months after
the lynching and found the situation
as it is.
s
"It is the opinion of many that
the other cases will not be tried,
but I have written to the attorney
general, asking him to continue un-
til every one of the alleged lynchers
has been brought to trial."
Mrs. Bailey reports that the In-
diana state anti-lynching, bill, which
recently passed both houses of the
Legislature,. will become law, with
or without the veto of the governor.
Mrs. Bailey writes:
"After the passage in the House
I wrote every branch in Indiana and
all the heads of lodges, clubs, etc.,
to send`a, letter to their senator to
support the bill, and to see that the
clauses with teeth im` them which
were dropped in the House were put
back in the bill. This was done and
so the bill has passed. The provi-
sions are that the fact that a pris-
oner is lynched is prima facle evi-
dence that the aheriff has falled to
perform his duty and make it man-
datory on the governor to remove
sim from office immediately, and
also provide for a penalty, against
the county in which a lynching oo-
cur, relatives may recover up to
$5000 and anyone surviving a lynch-
ing may recover up to $10,000. It
also provides for a property dam-
age."

in Georgia," Gov. High M. Dorsey
has issued in booklet form evidence

lynched, Negroes held in peonage
Negroes driven out by organized
lawlessness, and Negroes subjected
to individual acts of crucity" in
various counties of the state within
the last two years.

said," the Negro is being driven
out as if he were a wild beast;

were made, I believe the numbe
could be multiplied. In only two
of the 135 cases cited is the usual
crime against white women involved

been 418 in Georgia since 1885( a
larger number than in any other
state), form the smallest group of
the charges of Governor Dorsey.
He laid more stress on instances of
peonage among which was listed
the Williams case recently

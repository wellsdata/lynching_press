A Case of Lynch Law in Bedford.
It appears that the citizens of Liberty, in Bed-
ford county, have been aroused by one of the
startling acts of crime, with which the press of
the day is teeming, to inflict the Lynch Law upon
a free negro villian. The facts of the shocking
case, as detailed to us by a correspondent.
are briefly these:
" It appeared from the statements of others
and his own confessions that he was found in bed
with two little white girls on Tuesday night after
they had fallen to sleep. Their father( one
of the most respectable citizens of the place)
was absent on business in this city, and there
was no grown person about the house except an
old negro woman who was sleeping in the same
room. The boy had broken in at a window, and
when discovered was lying very quietly, and apparently
asleep, between the two little girls, and
when the alarm was given by them he made his
escape. The citizens of the place on Thursday
morning.upon hearing his confessions of the fact
that he was there and for what purpose, and feeling
, very indignant, held a meeting, in the Court
House( which was attended by nearly all the citizens
); and resolved unanimously to have the monster
brought forth from the jail, and publicly castrated
, which was accordingly done, in the Court
House, in the presence of the meeting. A slave
who was also somewhat implicated, was brought
out and whipped until the meeting was satisfied,
and his master was notified to have him
from the county within twenty days." removed

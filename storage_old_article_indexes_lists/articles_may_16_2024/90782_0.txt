DEFIES THE LAW.
DALLAS, TEX., MOB
Armed Deputies' Behavior Gives
Lawless Whites Full Sway.
Applications of lynch law in Texas
are not so infrequent as to excite surprise
, but there was an amazing exhibition
of the mob spirit in the city
of Dallas recently, says the Brooklyn
Daily Eagle, when a Negro accused of
assault was seized in the county court,
removed from the custody of officials
charged with the duty of protecting
him and thrown from a window to his
death. The fall broke the man's neck,
but his dead body was hanged as an
edifying public spectacle and afterward
delivered with some ceremony
to the city officials for burial. There
was a merciful absence of the stake,
the fagots and the vending of the
charred relics which have characterized
other lynchings, yet the defiance
of the law was never more open, nev.
er more outrageous and never more incendiary
in its effect upon public morals
than in this instance.
The man was under trial. The case
against him was strong. There was
no reason to think that he would escape
conviction. But the mob was
impatient for blood and refused to
tolerate even the small and necessary
delays in the administration of Texas
justice. Of course there will be an
investigation, but no one supposes that
punishment will be meted out to those
who defied the dignity of the court.
The spirit of the law in Texas is
measured by the behavior of the fifty
armed deputies who, after the killing
of the Negro, meekly permitted a mob
search of other accused men to bat-
In ter in the doors of the Dallas jail.

Murder of a Girl at Pierce City,
Mo., Excites the Populace.
Two Negro Suspects Taken from Jail and
Summarily Disposed of and Others
Are in Danger- Negro Houses
Burned.
Pierce City, Mo., Aug. 20.- Will God
ley, a negro, was lynched by a mob
composed of 1,000 armed citizens
shortly after dark last night for the
murder of Miss Caselle Wild, whose
dead body was found yesterday in
the woods near here. The mob went
to the jail about nine o'clock and
battered down the doors and threw
ropes around the necks of Godley and
Jean Carter, another suspect. Godley
was hanged in front of the Lawrence
hotel and his body riddled with bullets
.
Carter was shot to death in the
streets by the same mob a few minutes
later. Neither of the victims is
believed to have had any connection
with the murder, but both of them
bore very bad reputations and were
lynched on general principles. God
ley had just completed a term in the
state penitentiary for an assault upon
a white woman 60 years old in this
vicinity some years ago.
Ike Carter's house, in which were
Pete and Bob Hampton, two negroes
of desperate character, was bombard.
and fired. Several negro women
who were in the house were fired upon
, one being shot. The people are
determined to drive all the negroes
out of the town and surrounding
country, and a regular race war is on.
Miss Caselle Wild, an estimable
young lady of this city, was assaulted
while going home from Sunday school
by a negro, who, after ravishing her,
cut her throat from ear to ear. The
crime was committed at a bridge near
the' Frisco track, a half mile distant
from the depot. The girl was cross-
ing the bridge when the brute, who
had been sitting on the rail, attacked
her. A farmer in an adjoining field
saw the assault, but hearing no out
ery paid no attention to the matter.
Later his suspicions were aroused by
seeing a negro running down the rail
road track. He gave the alarm and
the mangled body of the girl was
found lying in the weeds near the
' Frisco tracks under the bridge. At
once a posse organized and set out
in pursuit of the perpetrator of the
foul deed. Two negroes were
rested. ar

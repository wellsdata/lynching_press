FIGHT.
A DESPERATE
Ten Negroes Hanged By Riotous Ital-
ian Laborers.
BALTIMORE, Md., August 3.- A rumor
reached this city through officers of the
steamer Eastern Shore that two gangs of
Italian and negro laborers had a desperate
fight in Northampton county, Va., in the
latter part of last week and an Italian boss
had been killed. This so enraged the foreigners
that they made an onslaught on the
negro camp, capturing ten of the darkies
and hanged them. The place is remote from
telegraph and no confirmation of the
the affair can yet be had.

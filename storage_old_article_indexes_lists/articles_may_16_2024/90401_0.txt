To lynch a man is to murder him,
federal government has the and what
to do with murder committed in a
state in violation of the laws thereof
Judge Jones of the United States?
a distinction between lynching or
other mob lawlessness inspired by a
mere felonious purpose to avenge
alleged crime and a lynching attri- an
colored citizen who was taken from
the Huntsville jail, and lynched,
pite the resistance of the state des- au-
and virtue enough in some of its stat-
utes designed to give effect to the
civil war amendments to permit federal
action in the Maples case.
But how are jurors to determine
whether a given lynching is merely a
crime against the laws of the State
or also a crime against the laws of
the United States? Judge Jones suggests
the following test:" Considering
what was said, as well as what
was done by the mob would a white
man, under the same circumstances,
have been attacked or murdered by
the mob ?? If Mr. Maples
was
lynched because he was a negro, and
if a white man accused of the same
crime would not have been murdered
by a mob, the lynching was an offense
against the laws enacted to
carry into the thirteenth and
fourteenth effect amendments.

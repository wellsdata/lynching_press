ATTEMPT TO LYNCH
MAYOR OF OMAHA
Body Drawn Twice from the Ground-
Same Mob That Lynched Negro
Omaha, Neb., Sept. 28.- An attempt to
lynch Mayor Edward P. Smith was made
this afternoon by the mob which later
hanged William Brown, a
negro. The
mayor to- night was said to be in a crit-
ical condition at a hospital although his
physician declined to say just how seriously
he is injured. A rope was thrown
around his neck and he was pulled off
the ground twice before two police officers
succeeded in cutting the rope and
getting him into an automobile and away
from the mob.
The mayor had gone to the court house
and held a consultation with
Sheriff
Clark. Emerging from the court house,
he met the mob and began to make an
for law order
appeal and. Somebody
shouted" lynch him" and a member of
the mob threw a rope around his neck.
Several
men dragged the
mayor
half a block and threw the loose end
of the rope over a trolley pole. Twice
they drew the mayor body from the
ground. Each time two police officers
cut the rope. Following the second
attempt these officers succeeded in
placing the mayor into a police motor
car and rushed him to a surgeon's
office nearby. The mayor was bleeding
from the mouth and
nose and after
a brief examination by physicians
was taken to a hospital. At the hospital
, it was stated by the physicians
at midnight that he was still unconscious
.
A corps of physicians began working
over him as soon as he was removed
to the hospital. His face and
body were badly by being
dragged by the mob bruised.

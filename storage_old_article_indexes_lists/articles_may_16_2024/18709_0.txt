Black Fiend Put to Death In Sight of
Home of White Girl Whom He Had
Attacked After State's Chief Executive
Makes a Plea Against Use
Violence. of
Columbia, S. C., Aug. 17.- Within the
shadow of the home of his victim, Miss
Jennie Brooks, after having been identified
by her and after Governor D. C.
Heyward, who went to the scene of
the trouble, had addressed the mob in
vain, Bob Davis, a negro, was lynched
at Greenwood.
Governor Heyward reached the scene
shortly after the negro had been captured
.
A platform was erected in a
fence corner on the premises of the
victim's father, from which platform
Governor Heyward addressed the mob
in an effort to prevent the lynching.
The governor beseeched the mob not
to lynch Davis, but in vain. At the
conclusion of his speech the governor
was vociferously cheered. The mob
then removed the prisoner from the
view of the governor and riddled him
with bullets.
Body Riddled With Bullets.
It is impossible, to estimate the
crowd, as citizens from several counties
had gathered at the scene and for
two days had been in pursuit of the
negro, but it is certain that hundreds
of bullets were sent through his body.
The militia in that section of the state
is now encamped at Chickamauga, and
there were no nearby troops to be
called upon. The governor's guards
and the Richland volunteers of this
city had been ordered to hold them
selves in readiness in the event that
their services were needed, but the
mob was determined.
The assault by Davis on Miss Brooks
was made in her father's store, where
was temporarily in charge. After
making some purchases the
negro
grasped a meat knife, shouting," You
are what I want," and sprang toward
the girl. Miss Brooks attempted to de
fend herself with an iron bar, but the
negro slashed her across the throat,
making a gash four inches long and
almost severed two of her fingers.
Afterward he went three miles to an
other farm and outraged a fourteen
year- old negress. A posse of a thou
sand men started in pursuit of the negro
soon after the outrage at the
Brooks store and finally captured him
near Ninety- six, a town nine
from Greenwood. miles

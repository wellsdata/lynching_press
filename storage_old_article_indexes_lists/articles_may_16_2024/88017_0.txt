In a fit of anger, 7- year- old Riley
Turnman murdered his sister, Lil-
lian Turnman, aged 4, at Bristow,
I. T. The tragedy occurred while
the children were at home alone.
The boy used a pocketknife, and
plunged it into his sister's skull,
death being almost instantaneous.
The boy told, at first, that his sister
had been shot by a negro, and
the lynching of a negro was prevented
, who had been caught and
seemed to be unable to explain his
whereabouts at the time of the trag-
soiledy by the confession of the lad,
disclosing, the facts.

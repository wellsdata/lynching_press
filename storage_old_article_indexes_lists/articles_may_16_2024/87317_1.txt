" I have this to say, you ruffians: that I
was transported, years ago, to Sydney, as a
convict as a forger; that I returned to Eng
land stouter than when I left her sea- girt
shores, so changed that the judges who sentenced
me did not know me- for I dined with
them and their daughters; that I moved in
aristocratic circles, and got letters of introduction
to the British Minister at Washington, as
Mr. Exeter Westminster; that I scratched out
the Mr.,' and affixed the title' Sir' to those
letters; that as I moved in the first circles in
England, I can also boast of moving in the
best circles in the United States, and have
duped and befooled your wisest statesmen.
When I am dead, and my dangling body is
cut down from the limb which is now swinging
over my head, bury me where you please; and
if you ruffians are Christians enough to a
tombstone over my grave, inscribe on it this:
Here lies the famous forger, Dick Gascon, of
London, a Sydney convict, who was hung by a
mob of Kentuckians. He was affianced to the
belle of Kentucky, who soon after became blind
as a bat; whom he robbed of her patrimony,
was pursued, captured, imprisoned, lynched
by a ruffianly mob, and hung from the limb
of a tree. He died a game Englishman.""
" Incensed at this speech, the mob cried,
" Let him swing!"" Let him twitch!" and a
minute after Dick Gascon's, alias Sir Exeter
Westminster's body" twitched" his last in
the agonies of death. He was buried by the
mob under the tree from which he had been
hung. The tree had budded, but strange to
say, it never leaved after. Six months after it
was as dead as the occupant of the rough
under its withered branches. grave

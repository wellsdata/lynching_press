TEAR OFF THE BANDAGE!
" BECAUSE a Negro sued a white man for shooting the Negro's cow,
the Negro was lynched near Doss, in Moorehouse Parish, Thursday
night."
Thus reads a a news item from Monroe, Louisiana, published in an
obscure corner of a daily paper on August 16th.
" Justice is blind," it is averred. But this is not because her eyes
are bandaged. If Justice has any. regard for the chastity of her sisters,
Truth and Honor, it is about time that she tore off her bandage and
took one hasty look about her at the ravishers of Decency and of
and of Faith. Virtue

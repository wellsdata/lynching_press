COLD- BLOODED MURDER.
PETERRBURG, Va., May 21.- At Jerusa-
lem, Southampton county, to day S. Lewis,
white, killed Jas. Newsom, colored. New
som made a demand on Lewis for a small
amount due him, when the former was shot
by the latter in the region of the heart.
It is supposed an old political feud was the
prime cause of the murder. Lewis was arrested
. Great indignation prevails among
the colored people to- night and lynching
seems imminent. A strong guard has been
placed at the jail to prevent such threat
being carried into execution. As
fell a fire of Lewis missed him. Newsom

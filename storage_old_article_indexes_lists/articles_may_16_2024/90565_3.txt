OPINIONS OF VISITORS.
Governor
Kibbey Believes Governor
Folk Will Meet the Emergency.
Louis, April 16.- Expressions
were St. sought today from the visiting
governors concerning the Springfield
lynching. Governor
Hagerman of
New Mexico said:
" Such a lynching
as took place in Springfield. under a
statue of liberty with the police helpless
could not have occurred in New
Mexico. Our mounted police are mea
who would take no account of the
odds against them in enforcing the
law. It would be
a lasting disgrace to
a sheriff in the territory to have a
prisoner taken from him by a mob, as
it is to have a prisoner escape."
Governor Hoch
of Kansas. said:
" Race prejudice is not bounded by
geographical lines. This outbreak, in
which the mob did not learn whether
the prisoners were guilty, is another
instance of this hyena- like spirit."
Governor Jos. H.
Kibbey of Ari-
zona stated:" There is no condition
under which I favor mob or lynch law.
and when a body of citizens or men
pretend to take the law into their own
hands and administer justice, the perpetrators
of the offense should be
punished.
" This statement is general. I do not
wish
to express an opinion on a
purely local affair, which might be
construed into a criticism either of
Governor Folk or of the officials
at
Springfield. I believe that Governor
Folk will handle the situation with
credit
."

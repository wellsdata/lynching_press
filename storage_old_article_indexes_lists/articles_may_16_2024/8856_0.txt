Negroes Frightened.
The recent lynchings of negroes in
southern Arkansas, and especially the
burning of Ed Coy at Texarkana, has
caused a large exodus of blacks from that
part of the state. It is estimated that 2,000
will leave within a month for the Chero-
kee strip, which will be thrown open
soon for settlement. Negroes have already
organized in Jefferson, Desha,
Chicot and Lincoln counties and are
selling their lands. Two hundred left
Pine Bluff last night. Farmers are realizing
the seriousness of the movement,
as it will interfere with planting
spring crops.- New York World. their

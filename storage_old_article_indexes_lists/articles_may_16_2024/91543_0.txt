THREE LYNCHED BY
ORDER OF COURT.
Mob Selects" Jury," Storms
Jail and Holds" Trial."
Union City, Tenn., Nov. 25.- By order
of a court of law at Tiptonville, in
the heart of the district recently
thrown into turmoil by the Night
Riders who killed Captain Rankin,
three negroes, brothers, were lynched
by a mob.
As the infuriated crowd rushed upon
the trio after the court had pronounced
sentence of death 500 militiamen
were hurrying to Tiptonville under instructions
from Governor Patterson to
prevent the lynching.
The men who met death after this
amazing" court" procedure were Marshall
, Edward and James Stineback.
Their crime was the murdering of
Deputy Sheriff Richard Burrus and
the wounding of John Hall, a deputy
sheriff. The brothers shot the officers
after a disturbance at a religious meet-|
ing.
Two hundred armed men caught the
negroes after a long chase, and they
were cast into jail.
They announced that the men must
be lynched at once, but J. L. Burdette,
a lawyer, pleaded with them to let the
law take its course.
Justice Davis was brought from the
scene, a jury was selected from the
mob, it found the negroes guilty, the
jail was stormed, and the negroes
hanged, all within the space of
were fifteen minutes.

Feeling is intense, but it is not believed
that any attempt will be made
to thwart the law's processes. Stevens'
actions, if he is really guilty, are a
puzzle to all who have even the slightest
acquaintance with him. He has
always been the most radical in matters
of which he now stands accused,
and only recently expresed a desire to
assist in lynching a negro in another
who had been accused
city of rape.
Stevens has a brother in Lincoln who
is head machinist in the Journal offices
. The brother in Lincoln said he
desired to aid the on√® in trouble, but
doubted his ability to secure the re-
he quired bond.

Under The Lash of The Whip
Colored people are being bombed and burned, discriminated
and lynched, yet every night the same giggling, silly ,,
insipid faces can be seen sucking caberet" liquid" thru a straw
and dancing away the time that should be used for organization
and preparation. What should be done to wake the race up?
the politicians that protect the vicious institutions
Probably have a remedy.

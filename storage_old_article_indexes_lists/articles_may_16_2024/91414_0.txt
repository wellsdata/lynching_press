And His Liquor Raiding Crowds
Mob Threatens To Lynch Mayor
Cincinnati Police Chief and
Patrolmen Rescue Officials
at College Hill,
After They Are Roughly
Used by Crowd.
Cincinnati, O., Nov. 11.- Surrounded
by a threatening crowd
that gathered from miles around,
Mayor A. R. Pugh of North College
Hill, a suburb of Cincinnati, and
four liquor court deputies, were
rescued last night by Cincinnati police
and Cheviot officers after having
been marooned in the
town
hall of the latter city for four hours.
The demonstration started when
the mayor and his deputies appeared
for trial before Magistrate
Samuel Williams on charges of assault
and battery and pointing firearms
, preferred by Mrs. Henry
Smith of Dent, Ohio, whose home
they raided in search for liquor,
several days ago.
When the cases were called the
defendants entered pleas of not
guilty and the trials were continued
until next Friday.
This was the signal for an out-
break on the part of the crowd,
members of which jostled their way
to the side of the defendants, demanding
that the trial proceed.
Someone turned out the lights, and
when they flashed up again Green-
lee Hahn, a deputy, had a broken
nose, and others of the deputies exhibited
evidence of rough handling.
" Lynch' Em," Mob Cries.
Seeing that the danger was growing
steadily the court and village
officials rushed through the crowd
and hustled the deputies and Mayor
Pugh into the jall, in the basement
of the building." Hang' em," and
" get a rope," were cries heard on
every side.
Appeals for order being of
no
avail, Cincinnati was called upon
for aid and reserves arriving,
a
cordon was formed around the hall
and Mayor Pugh and deputies were
rush to Cincinnati, the crowd having
thinned out. Three automobiles
to belong to deputies were over-
said turned and set afire.

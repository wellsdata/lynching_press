DELEWARE'S GOVERNOR
Distressed Over the Warm Incident
at Wilmington.
Dover, Dela .. June 23.- Governor
Hunn appeared distressed today over
the lynching of the negro, White.
When pressed for a statement, he said:
" There is nothing to say now. Let the
people become calm once more and reflect
upon what has been done in a
great frenzy of excitement. I shall
confer with the attorney general to
see what course we can take."
It was learned today that the governor
received a telegram at 11:30
o'clock last night from J. Newlin
Gawthorp, president of the trustees of
the Newcastle county workhouse and
David J. Reinhardt, solicitor of the
city of Wilmington. It reads as follows
:
.
" Call militia out at once to protected
workhouse property. Already entered
by mob of 2,000 men."
It was then too late for the governor
to take such action as the troops could
not have reached the scene in time
prevent the lynching. to

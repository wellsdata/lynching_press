PUT THE MOB DOWN.
A Negro was lynched Jan-
uary 18, 1916, at Buckville,
Ark., for slapping a small
white boy. After the mob had
disposed of the Negro in its
brutal and summary way, it
burned down the Negro
schoolhouse. Why did the
mob burn down the schoolhouse
? Because, one may sup
pose, school education prepares
one to resist insults, whether
coming from white or colored
, and causes one to denounce
all forms of lawless
ness.
Such items as this one;
lynching a Negro and burning
down a Negro school o se-
are of such common occurrence
that they barely get a
paragraph in our daily papers.
If a Negro is burned alive, he
may get two paragraphs, but
no bitter denunciation in ed-
itorial comment. Should such
a horror be perpetuated on
the battle fronts of the bloodiest
war of history, now rag.
ing in Europe, our great A
merican press would go wild
in denouncing the barbarity,
but if a Negro is nailed in a
pine box, saturated with coal
oil and bnrned to a crisp in
Mississippi, the news columns
will tell the story simply, and
the editorial page be as silent
as death on this bit of Southern
pastime.
It is indifference to the mob
this callousness to crime, this
tolerance to race hatred, that
has emboldened the Klu Klux
to resurrect in Southeast Mis
souri and start once more on
their night ride for murder
and arson. So the news come
from down around New Ma-
drid, the hotbed of Negro
nching and banishment, that
the night- riders are in the
saddle. It is like the Klu
Klux, a secret organization of
oyth- bound assassins, only
now their idea is to kill rich
white men instead of poor Ne-
groes; to burn white factories
and mills instead of Negro
churches and schoolhouses;
to burn down towns and make
white families shelterless in-
stead of driving the Negro
nopulation out of the
like they did at Pierre town City.

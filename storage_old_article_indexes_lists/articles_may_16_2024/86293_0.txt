THE MOB SPIRIT AND THE LAW
Recent dispatches from various parts of the
United States indicate an increasing tendency
to resort to mob law for the purpose of wreaking
summary vengeance on a prisoner who is
either awaiting trial or under sentence of death
for some serious crime.
This manifestation of a lawless spirit is not
confined to any special section of the country.
It has asserted itself of late in communities
long noted for the law- abiding character of
their people, and, it is therefore all the more to
be reprehended. One of the latest instances
is reported from an old- fashioned Massachu
setts town where the authorities were compelled
to resort to extraordinary precautions
to prevent a mob from breaking jail and lynching
three culprits charged with grave crimes.
In the Massachusetts case the prisoners were
in jail awaiting trial, and it was safe to assume
that the courts would deal with them according
to their deserts. But the impatient mob
wanted vengeance, ont justice, and was eager
to subordinate the ordinary processes of civilization
to its own primitive and savage notions
of right.
It can not be too emphatically asserted that
this is a land of law and order and that there
can be no toleration of the mob spirit under
any pretext, or whatever may be the provocation
. Justice is, and must continue to be, supreme
in this land of liberty regulated by law.

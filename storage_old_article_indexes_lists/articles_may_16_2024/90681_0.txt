Salisbury while sentries, with loaded
guns and orders to shoot to kill, patrol
the four streets that surround the
prison. There have been threats and
rumors of threats all day and into the
night, but there has been no demon-
stration and it is believed the worst
is over.

gomery county who is said to have led
the mob which lynched the three alleged
murderers of the Lyerly

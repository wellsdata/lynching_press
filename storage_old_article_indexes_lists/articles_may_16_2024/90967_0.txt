some crazy house for the remainder
cf his days, in behalf of justice and
humanity, stood up in the midst of the
other Senators, shaking and tossing
his brainless head from side to side,
raging, snorting, and bellowing like
a big South Carolina mad bull, and
exclaimed that" when we get ready to
put a' Nigger's' face in the sand we
put his body there too. The South
will not submit to Negro domination.
The threat of Negro domination hangs
over us like the sword of Damocles.
Lynchings will continue as long as
those fiends outrage our wives and
daughters."
One or two Senators endeavored
remonstrate with Senator Tillman
and they very politely suggested that
al!" the Colored men, mobbed and
lynched in the South are not guilty of
raping white women, at that he turned
upon them like an untamed savage,
and roaring like a wild maniac shout-
,
ed at the top of his Anarchistic voice,
what" Do you want your beautiful
daughter to marry a big burly black
Nigger?
It will"

" Until recently attempts have been
nade to lead the world to believe
that these frequent lynchings of color-
confined to cases
ed people were
where women were assaulted, and punishment
. by mob- murder in every case
is declared by prominent citizens to be
justifiable in order to save the woman
from testifying in open court.
But of late the colored men have been
lynched for all kinds of offenses, large
and small. Lynchings are on the increase
and have become so frequent
as to make true the general proposition
that in the United States colored
persons when accused of crime are not
arrested, indicted, tried by jury according
to prescribed forms and when
convicted punished by the regular officers
of the law, but they are seized
put to death by lynch law and
and mob violence.

VERY TIMELY. TIMELY.
Almost simultaneously with the ac.
quittal of the third man charged; with
having participated in the Coatsville
lynching, comes the report that a Ne-
gro has accosted a high school white
girl on the regular "lonely" road near
Coatsviile.
S
Just how much of this report is true
we are unable to say. We do think
it both timely and unfortunate for the
cases not being heard in that county.
It is possible, and we refuse to dis-
cuss the probability, that some one
arranged just such a reporin order
to justify the aiready prevalent senti-
ment in favor of the several defend-
ants whose acquittals now seem but a
question of time and regular process.
Could a jury of white men convict an-
other white man of having participat-
ed in the lynching of a Negro who
shot a white officer with the news of
recent attack upon a "pretty white
gırl" fresh in their minds?

The whole situation is unfortunate
for the case in that it will reduce the
whole aflair to a degree of laxity and
unimportance which will do the com-
munity an injustice as well as the
State untold harm. If any man be
found guilty of rape, let him have the
'- penalty unadulterated. I any man
participate in a lynching of any form,
let the guilty party have his portion.
in no case should c rtumstances be
allowed to interfere with the course
of justice.
in our opinion, a change of venue,
asked for by the district attorney
´ would have brought more satisfaction
to the people, and certainly a more
decided vindication of the fair name
of the State of Pennsylvania. Shall
history read that a human being was
burned to death in Pennsylvania by
a mob of men and women, and not a
soul was found guilty of the crime?
Indications at present point that way.

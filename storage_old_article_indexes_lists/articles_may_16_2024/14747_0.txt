They Still Wanted to Lynch Mayo.
The people of Newcastle were greatly incensed
against Justice Cousins and Constable
Crop for removing from their reach John W.
Mayo, the negro accused of assaulting two little
girls. They were still talking of lynching him
on Thursday when Superintendent Corey was
at the mine, the negroes being particularly
violent, but Mr. Corey gave them a lecture, saying
that the lynching of negroes in the South
imitated
was not a custom to be.

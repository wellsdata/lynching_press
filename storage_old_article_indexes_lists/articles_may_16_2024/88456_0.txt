HIS LIFE PAID FOR NINE.
SAM LEWIS LYNCHED IN FLORIDA
The Jailer Is Killed by a Volley From the
Mob- A Man of Many
Crimes.
Jacksonville, Fla., Aug. 18.- A special
to the Times- Union from Jupiter, Fla.,
says: Samuel Lewis was taken from
jail at Juno by a mob at 3 o'clock, hanged
to a telegraph pole in front of the court
house and then riddled, with bullets. The
mob approached the jail with sledge
hammers and began to batter down the
door. Seeing that they were determined
to get in, Jailer Keyser threw the mob the
keys. As the lynchers entered
Deputy Sheriff Perkins, who was in the
jail, fired at them. The lynchers fired
a volley in return, killing Sheriff Keyser.
They then dragged Lewis from his cell,
clad only in an undershirt, and lynch d
him. the nude body of the victim hung
until a late hour this morning, when it
was cut down. The lynchers came to
Juno, which is on Lake Worth, in boats
from Biscayne bay, the scene of Lewis'
crimes.
Some weeks ago Lewis in cold blood
shot down Ex- Tax Collector John High
Smith and his nephew, John Davis, because
they refused to kneel and apologize
for a fancied insult. The murderer
fled to Nassau, but the English
authorities got after him and he was
taken back to Florida, but escaped.
About a week ago he was captured after
a fight, in which he killed Itet McGregor,
one of the posse, and was hiaiself Ladiy
wounded.
Lewis was a native of Vermont, but
came to Florida fron the west. ITe
boasted that he had killed two men in
Montana and three in Texas. So, including
Jailer Keyser, Lewis was responsible
for the death of nine men. It is said
that Lewis was the first white man ever
lynched in Florida. The lynching is
erally approved. gen-

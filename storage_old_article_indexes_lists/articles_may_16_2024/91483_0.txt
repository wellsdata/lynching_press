THE TEXAS LYNCHING
While Houston has been preparing
for the Democratic convention an
ugly occurrence has raised its head,
the lynching of a Negro by men who
seized him from a hospital cot.
The Texans who were responsible
for this occurrence doubtless regard
themselves as having taken fitting
revenge upon a man whom they felt
deserved summary punishment. They
did not pause to reflect that every
entitled to trial. Actuated
person is
by primitive instincts they by their
deed themselves have committed a
heinous crime and have thrown a
blot upon the fair name of their
city.
Mob law does reduce crime.
It merely multiplies not resentment.

JUSTICE DELIVERED TO ANOTHER BLOW
N the reprehensible action of the angry mob at Pueblo which
lynched two Mexicans, who were being held in connection with
the murder of a patrolman, we see not only a flagrant violation
of justice, but an action which can only intensify the strained
relations between the United States and Mexico.
Mob rule in addition to being incompatible to law and order.
and an unconscionable violation of the laws which grant all persons
a fair trial, is at all times, at the most, inaccurate in retaliation,
chiefly because of the blinded passion leading those who would take
the law in their hands. As a result, oft times, the lives of innocent
persons merely held on suspicion in connection with crimes are
sacrificed and the guilty go unpunished.
That adequate punishment will be meted out to members of the
mob responsible for the lynching is promised in a statement
given out by the governor of Colorado, and justly sp, as it leaves a
blot on the name of the fair state of Colorado and the city of Pueblo,
which only a rigorous hunting down and bringing to justice of the
ring leaders of the mob can rectify.
In addition, from an international standpoint, it will be exceedingly
difficult for the Mexican government to understand why such
threatening representations are made to her because of the depredations
committed against Americans in bandit- infested districts of
Mexico, when Mexico's nationals are lynched in the orderly state of
Colorado, and by a body of citizens at that- not bandits. Such incidents
can only more marked the misunderstanding between
the two countries. make- Globe Record.

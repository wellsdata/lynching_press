NEGRO LYNCHED FOR
CRIMINAL ASSAULT
Saturday afternoon about two
o'clock, a negro named Abraham
Denson went to the home of Jim
Tyner near Azor and committed
an assault upon his wife. There
were two other ladies at the
home when the negro went there
but could give no assistance.
After committing the assault
the negro started for the woods
and as soon as a posse could be
formed search was begun. Some
where near two o'clock the negro
was discovered in the woods a
bout two miles from the Tyner
home where he committed the assault
and was arrested by Constable
Tom Phillips. The negro
was carried before squire Mit-
chell, of Parker township, and on
account of the absence of some
it was decided to post-
witnesses pone the trial until today.

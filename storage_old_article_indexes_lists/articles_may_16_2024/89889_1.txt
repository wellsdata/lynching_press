PENNSYLVANIA TOWN
DEPORTS BLACK PEOPLE
Coatsville, Pa.- Coatsville has started
to deport Negroes brought to the
steel town during the war labor shortage
, it was learned yesterday. Police
are rushing the men out of town
afoot and penniless, in many instances
and telling them to" head south and
stay away."
The first drive in this direction was
started on Tuesday, and according to
public announcements made by the
police, others are to follow. Thirty
Negroes were taken to the Cain
bridge, on the outskirts of Coatsville
to the south, and driven out of town.
The roundup was made on South
First avenue, where the Negroes congregate
in poolrooms and cigar stores,
under the direction of Constable A. S.
Jackson and state police, who have
been stationed in Coatesville for some
weeks. More than fifty men were
rounded up.
Every man was then asked to produce
his employes' check showing that
he was a worker. Men who were unable
to produce said checks were put
into the" southbound gang," as the
cops called it. Under guard of foot
and the mounted state
police constabulary
they were escorted away.
The police say that since the steel
mills have been curtailing production
with the signing of the armistice,
crime has been on the increase in
Coatesville. Hundreds of Negroes
have been loafing around the town,
and every night large numbers apply
at the city hall for lodgings.
The number of" free lodgers" who
either couldn't find work or didn't
want to work became so large that
,
the local authorities started to line
morning and order
them up every
them out of town. In some instances
cops were detailed to see that these
erders were obeyed; but, according to
the police, the Negroes invariably returned
.
It has been announced that the
state and Coatesville police will make
frequent raids and that all men who
cannot show that they are residents
of the town or employed will be driv-
en out.
Negroes were imported to Coates-
ville in large numbers while the steel
plants were running night and day on
war orders. Even with the large
gangs brought in it was impossible
for the plants to get enough men.
Employment agents were sent to vari-
points and
ous southern recruiting
transportation was provided for the
workers.
Negroes in Coatesville said yesterday
that the Lukens Steel Company
had laid off very few men, but hundreds
have been discharged from the
Midville plants. Some of the men
say they cannot find work and that
they have no funds to go elsewhere
to seek it.
The worst example of crime Coates-
ville has known was the robbery on
Tuesday night of the American Express
office, for the fourth time in
three weeks. Thieves ripped open at
their leisure every package stored in
the place and got away with several
hundred dollars' worth of valuables.
It is true that a great crime wave
is in progress in this section of the
country since the signing of the armis-
t√≠ce. The most daring things to be
found anywhere are operating, with
few arrests among the professionals;
but when they are caught they are
nearly always white.
Negroes are few among the thugs
Yet Negroes are being driven out of
Coatesville because of crime. While
the war was in operation labor agents
come to
were begging Negroes to
Coatesville and other towns to work.
But since the signing of the armistice
and the closing of many steel plants,
they are through with the Negro.
Think of it, 100 per cent American
city herding Negroes like cattle, when
no direct charge of crime is charged
them. other
to In Coatesville and
allowed to hang
towns bums are
around unmolested; but if a Negro is
thrown out of work through the closing
of contracts, he is classed as an
undesirable. And we are making the
world a decent place to live in.
Why don't they make the United
States a decent place for the Negro
to live in before dictating to Europe
about" democracy?".

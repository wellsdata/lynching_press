Farmer Lynched By
HATTIESBURG, Miss.--(By Da-
vid Jones for ANP. The ynching
of Negroes in the state of Mississ-
ippi has become so commonplace
and trite that it has been urned
into just a laughing matter.
So savage and barbarois,
devoid of the timer parts
so utterly
that are
very evident in cultured and re-
fined people and which
go to
make up the datum posts of civili-
zation, are they that they are mur-
dering Negroes now without the
slightest twinge of conscience.
The body of 2. J. Tyrone, a
prosperious Negro farmer of Law
rence county, was found shot 10
pieces in the woods by the house
on the night of the 25 of March,
where he had been jynched by a
mob of whites about the 22nd of
the same month-the bedy having
lain there since that time.
There are quite a number of pros-
perous Negroes in that county who
by stin, and the practice of crono-
my have placed themselves far
above dependence upon the whites
of that locality and are living above 1
want and need.
Tyrone was among that member.
And since the race is not expected.
to prosper and their prosperity not
only excites the wonder of their
white neighbors, but also their vi-
cious ouvy, and arouse in them a
desire for the explollation on thei
part, he was marked for slaughter

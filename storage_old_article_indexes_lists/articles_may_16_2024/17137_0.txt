THE MOB AT DENTON, MD.- The Denton
Journal says there is no Dave Thomas, the
mob which hung
murderer of Butler, also released two other prisoners
and tied the sheriff. The latter was at
the jail, and did all in bis power to preserve order
and prevent the act both by pesuasion and
,
threats, but the influences against which he
had to contend were decidedly too formidable
and he was compelled, to yield.

HE JUMPED TO HIS DOOM.
Negro Murderers Lynched By Mis-
sissippi Citizens.
Bolin, Miss., Dec. 28.- Two negroes
named Jim Martin and Frank West
were lynched on the Baker creek bridge
one- quarter of a mile west of this
place, about 8 o'clock tonight for the
murder of an aged and highly respected
citizen, named Milton S. Haire
and an attempted criminal assault on
his niece, Miss Curran. The murder
was one of the most cold blooded in
the criminal annals of the country.
Robbery was the incentive, the negroes
being under the impression that a
large sum of money was concealed in
the house.
Martin and West
were captured
about 10 o'clock this morning. It required
a hard whipping to make the
former confess, when he broke down
and related the whole story. The town
marshal brought the prisoners to town
and placed them in the city prison.
About 7 o'clock a mob of 150 unmasked
men, composed of the best citizens of
the town, broke open the place and
took the two men to the bridge west of
town. Nooses were placed around their
necks, the other ends of the ropes being
tied to the cross- ties and they were
told to jump off the bridge. Martin
at once plunged into space, but West
had to be pushed off. The Associated
Press representative who passed
through the city on the westbound
train an hour afterward, saw the bodies
still hanging from the cross- ties.
Mr. Maire, the murdered man, was
about eighty years old and had nt-
ly recovered from a spell of insanity.

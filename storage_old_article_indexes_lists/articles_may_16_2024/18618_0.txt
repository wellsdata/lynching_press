THINK HE WASN'T HUNG.
Officers Say Treasurer scott Was Probably
Taken Out of the County.
SIOUX CITY, Ia., Jan. 2.- Officers from
O'Neill, Neb., are here looking for Bart-
lett Scott, the embezzling county treasurer
, supposed to have been captured by
mob and lynched Monday
& on.
They they have faith
say no
in the lynching story. Scott
was convicted and sentenced to
five years in prison. He was out under
heavy bonds and it is their theory that
his abductors were his friends.
They think the job was put up to get
him out of the country and at the same
time make it appear that he was lynched
so as to relieve his bondsmen. At last
reports no trace of him had been found,
alihough country around O'Neill
has been scoured the for the past two days.

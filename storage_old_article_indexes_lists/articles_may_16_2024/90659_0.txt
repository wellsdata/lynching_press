Governor Durbin of Indiana did his
plain duty in vacating the office of the
sheriff of Sullivan county for allowing
a mob to take and lynch a prisoner in
his charge. If sheriffs in charge of
prisoners in danger of being lynched
would do their full duty mobs would
soon learn not to molest them. It is a
sheriff's duty to protect his prisoner
at all hazards, no matter how great.
And when he makes up his mind to do
it very rarely experiences any further
he trouble.

Terrible Scenes.
CLIFTON FORGE, Va., Oct. 19.- After
the fight here on Saturday, between officers
and colored men, in which P. A.
Bowling and Fred Wilkinson, members
of the Sheriff's posse, were killed, the
excitement in the town became intense.
The negroes had come down from the
Hill mine with the avowed purpose of
creating a disturbance.
The news of the fracas spread like
wildfire, and in a short time 50 men
were scouring the mountains near by
whee the colored gang took refuge,
hunting them down.
In a few hours all of the colored men
were brought here and placed in jail,
after a desperate struggle for their lives,
and after receiving several wounds.
The prisoners were Charles Miller, a
notorious character from Bedford Coun-
shot three times before
ty, being
captuerd; William Martin from Madi-
son County, shot twice; Bob Burton,
shot in the leg in the first fight and a
boy.
Great excitement prevailed all the
afternoon, and there was talk of lynching
Miller, who was the ringleader, and
who is supposed to have shot Bowling.
The excitement grew as evening came
on and by dark the streets were full of
men crying for revenge.
About 11 p. m. a mob of 300 surrounded
the jail.
The Mayor and town officers urged the
men to let the law take its course, pointing
out the danger of mistakes and the
bad name a lynching would give the
place, but the mob would not listen and
made an attack on the prison, a frail
structure, easily entered.
Once in possession of the prisoners the
mob released the boy and attempted to
secure from the other three a confession,
but the men stoutly denied having committed
any crime.
The lynching was a terrible affair.
Three of the colored men were taken to
a desolate place known as' Slaughter
House Hollow,' about a quarter of a
mile from the Chesapeake and Ohio depot
.
The mob tied them to the same rope
and swung them up to the tree.
Before their heels were two feet from
the ground the firing began and their
bodies were riddled with bullets, the
foot of one of them falling off.
The excited crowd now thirsting for
blood returned to the jail and took the
wounded man to the same place and dispatched
him in the same manner.
The boy they held to the spot, and after
showing him how a colored man is
treated for killing a white they and
him go. let

New York City, July 26- The
National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People, with headquarters
at 70 Fifth Avenue, New
York City, today made public replies
to telegrams sent to Governors Bick-
lett of North Carolina and Hobby of
Texas with reference to lynchings in
those two states recently. One negro
was lynched at Roxboro, N. C., on
July 7. and two brothers were
lynched at Paris, Texas, on July 10.
The Association wired both governors
asking them what steps would be
taken to arrest and punish the lynchers
. Governor Bickett replied that-
" The reason why Texas has had seven
lynchings this year and North Carolina only
one can easily be seen when the attitude of
their respective governors is contrasted. In
the Texas affair where two colored boys were
lynched, later developments threw grave doubt
as to their guilt of the crime of murdering
their landlord, with which crime they had
been charged.
As long as recalcitrant reactionaries
like Hobby of Texas are in office,
lynching will continue. Some day soon America
is going to realize that she must intervene
in Texas as well as in Ireland.
" In the North Carolina case, the white
employer of Ed Roach, the Negro lynched, has
given a signed statement to the press that
Roach was at work at the time the criminal
assault took place for which crime Roach was
killed by a mob.",+

Some days since, it was ascertained that a fugitive
slave had taken refuge in the house of a citi-
izen of Mechanisburg, in Champaign county and
,
the Marshal who was in pursuit, proceeded to the
place of his concealment to arrest him. He was in
an upper room, and the Marshal sought to reach
him, by means of a ladder, from the outside. As
he was ascending, the negro fired upon him, the
ball hitting the rifle which the Marshal carried
in
his hand. This was more than the officer could
stand, and he thereupon retreated. On Tuesday of
last week, therefore, the Marshal collected a posse
and again visited Mechanicsbury; this time for
the purpose of arresting the man who harbored
the fagitive slave upon his premises. This offence,
says the Toledo Blade according to the Fugitive
Slave faw, is punishable by a fine of$ 1,000 and
imprisonment. On Wednesday he succeeded in
making the arrests, amid the most intense excite
/
which heightened
ment, was by the rumor that the
prisoners were to carried into Kentucky, where
a mob was ready be to lynch them.

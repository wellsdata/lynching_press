Lynch Law in Nevada.
Wretched Condition of Society- Reign of the
Roughs -- The People's Retribution.
From the Esmeralda( Nevada Territory) Star, Feb. 17.1
Eight days ago the people of Aurora, after a longit
week's patience, executed summary justice upon four as
murderous villains as were ever brought to the scaffold,
to die at the end of a rope. A state of affairs had existed
here, almost amounting to a reign of terror, for
it
nearly two years, but Dever assumed an organized
shape until tae town bseame incorporated. An election ction
was held, and the town council was composed of as
good men as we could boast; but the office of marshal
being an elective one, the rufillans were sucessful in
placing their own man in office, owing to the fact that
there were four or five candidates runnnig. No sooner
had the marshal been sworn in, than the worst villains
that ever infested a civilized community were appointed
policemen, and, with but few exceptions, they were
of as hard a set of criminals as ever went un-
composed of as
hung. If a quarrel sprang up at any time, a resort to
the pistol and knife was made at once, and murder,

overrule the officers at all hazards.
So long as they did not molest peaceable citizens,
their shooting and killing one another was borne with
by the people with utter indifference, and to a certain
degree the press remained silent. But when the guar-

MARION ,, Ind., Aug. 12.- Normal
conditions prevailed in Marion again
today, after the most exciting weekend
in the city's history, subsequent
to the lynching of two Negroes on
the courthouse lawn Thursday night.
State troops, composed of Company
K, Fort Wayne, and I, South
Bend, under command of Colonel
George H. Healy, left last night for
Camp Konx, Ky., to resume training
, and all but three members of
the state police squad likewise returned
to regular duties.
Local officials agreed that they
weald be able to handle the situation
, after funerals of the two
Negroes Monday.
With the burial of the
Negroes lynched, Abraham Smith two
and Thomas Shipp, there seemed to
be no further need for the troops or
state police here.
Complete and thorough investigation
and prosecution of the participants
in the double- lynching is
the program mapped out.
The situation was studied at a
meeting late Monday in the office
of Attorney- General James M. Og-
den, at which were present Earl B.
Stroup and Marle Wall, two deputy
attorneys- general; Harley F. Har-
din, Grant county prosecutor, and
L. O. Chasey, secretary to the Governor
.
The prosecution will be pushed
under the provisions of the state
lynching law, which provides a penalty
of life imprisonment or death

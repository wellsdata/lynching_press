Hour Jordan Over" Wings Over"
Edwin R. Embree Is Speaker
CHICAGO,-( ANP) Speaking
on" Democracy and a World At
War" over the Wings Over Jordan
program here Sunday, Edwin R. Em-
Bree, president of the Julius Rosen-
wald Fund, declared," If you ask
me if we have democracy even in
America, my answer is' no'. We do
not yet give full liberty and equal
opportunity to all the people. We
do not even give all citizens the
basic political rights of the vote
and equality before law. But we
I have been steadily the growing toward
democracy I in a full
. And say
voice- that with all her faults and
failures America is the brightest
hope for decency in human relations
, for opportunity and the pur.
suit of happiness by all the people
."
However, with the sudden plunging
of this nation into war, those
gains which have been made are
now periled. The, struggle against
the armies of Germany and Japan
is a struggle for the existence of
democracy and anyone who gives aid
or comfort to hate and discrimination
is a traitor, said the fund president
Contrasting. outbreaks of hostili-
ties, Mr. Embree called attention
to the nation's shocked attitude
when Pearl Harbor was bombed, but
declared that when, on January 25,
a mob lynched a helpless Negro in
Sikeston, Mo., this attack went almost
unnoticed.
Mr. Embree cited a three point
program which would lead toward
the preservation of democracy. These
points were employment, national
strength and unity, and the getting
to know our fellow Americans.
Lastly, he proposed that advantage
of the emergency should be taken
to get to know fellow Americans of
every group, and it will become natural
at patriotic meetings to include
Negroes as well as whites.
" And we can show courtesy to
all our fellow men. Negroes especially
have a right to expect from
others the same good manners that
they so handsomely show in
their human relations." all

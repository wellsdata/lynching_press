A MURDERER LYNCHED.
VIROQUA, Wis., June 2.- Andrew
Grandstaff was captured while in bed last
night by a Pinkerton detective and two
local officers. The detectives pumped a
full confession out of him. He intended
to rob old man Drake but was unable to
make him disclose the place where the
family valuables were hid. This led to
his killing Drake. Mrs. Drake attempted
to shoot Grandstaff and he killed her in
,
the presence of two children. To prevent
the little ones from telling he cut
their throats. Grandstaff has been known
as an ignorant but cunning and daring
semi- desperado. He has been a participant
in several affrays and an associate of
hard characters. Little is known of his
antecedents, only that he was of illegitimate
birth. As the people were greatly
and lynching threatened troops
excited were promptly ordered out by Gov. Rusk.

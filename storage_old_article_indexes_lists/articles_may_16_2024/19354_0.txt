The Sioux Indian, who recently ravished
Miss Dickinson, a school teacher, at her
home near Valentine in Northern Nebras
ka, has been arrested at Rosebud Agency,
and positively identified by that lady. The
authorities refused to give him up to the
Valentine officers for fear the Valentine
people would lynch him. He will, how
ever, be indicted and tried at Valentine,
to which place he will be brought when
the time arrives by means of a requisition
The exasperated citizens will then probably
hang him.-

CAROLINA'S LYNCHINGS.
The Negroes to Hold a Meeting During
the Columbia Carnival.
Columbia, S. C., May 13.- The recent
lynchings of negroes in this state are
having their effect with the colored race,
and a number of leading colored ministers
have issued a call for a conference to be
held here next Tuesday during the
Columbia carnival" to devise some plan
for the betterment of their condition as a
people." The circular says:" We sincerely
deplore the condition of affairs in
the state that makes it necessary for this
call, but owing to the fact that as citizens
of one of the states of this great commonwealth
, occupying the anomalous
position of being without adequate protection
for life or liberty, feeling
that the too frequent resorting to lynch
law and mob violence in this state is as
such we
deem it absolutely and imperatively
necessary to call together leading, or, at
least, the representative men of the race
from the various counties of the state for
the purpose of devising some plan or way
which our condition may be bettered
by and our lives made secure."

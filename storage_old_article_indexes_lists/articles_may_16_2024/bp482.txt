OPEN G. O. P. RALLYFOE
Senator Who Scored Rolph
to Speak at Meeting in
Jersey City Monday
United States Senator Hamilton F.
Kean of New Jersey, the first na-
tional Agure to raise his voice in
protest against the attitude of the
late Governor Rolph of California,
who "permitted a mob to lynch" two
men in that state last fall, will be
one of the many speakers at the
Negro Republican rally to be held
Monday evening at Lincoln High
School, Jersey City.
Senator Kean, who is running for
re-election, spoke his views on
lynching at a meeting held under the
auspices of the Plainfield Branch of
the N. A. A. C. P. shortly after the
California atrocity. The senator out-
lined plans for an anti-lynching bill
to his Plainfield audience. The bill
was drawn up and introduced by
Senator Kean, but it was over-rid-
den by the Southern Democratic
members of the
House. Kean
promises to introduce his bill again
when the next session of Congress
convencs.
Senator Kean and Motor Vehicle
Commissioner Harold G. Hoffman,
candidate for governor, were guest
speakers at one of the largest Re-
publican rallies ever held in Hudson

present.
At that meeting Senator Kean
flayed Mayor Frank Hague,
the
his
Democratic State leader, for
neglecting to build more than one
cchocl during the past six years, de-
spite the fact that many of the
schools are antiquated and over-
crowded.
He ridiculed the statement made
at Sea Girt by Governor Moore, who
said that he was the one who obtain-
cd $$7.000.000 rellef money from the
Federal government for the State of
New Jersey. Kean said that such
appropriations were made upon
recommendation of a board of five
inembers, of which he, Kean, was a
member.

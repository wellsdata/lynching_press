Thursday's race on the Ohio River, be
tween the Mountain Boy and the Mountain Girl,
the former carrying a Sheriff's posse, with
CRAFT and NEIL, two of those charged with the
triple murder of the GIBBONS family at Ashland,
and the latter carrying a lynching party in hot
pursuit, was certainly one of the strangest in-
edents on record either in steamboat racing or
lyneb law. The Boy Ead two miles the start.
and was crowded up to twelve miles an hour;
the Girl was also put to her top speed, and
rushed along the river amid tremendous
citement on the banks. At some oluts the ex-
shores were black with people, who somehow
got the news, and the river was crowded with
boats. The steamers were mates and a match;
but the Boy had the largest supply of coal
aboard and the advantage of the start, while
the lynchers, in their eagerness, had overcrowded
the Girl. Whether it was that she
could not make up the distance, or that the Boy
stopped at one point and took a body of armed
militia aboard, at any rate the Girl at length
gave up the most exciting chase known on the
Obio of late years, and the Sheriff's prisoners
were safely lodged in Maysville jail. Probably
this will be immortalized in river ballads.
Luckily race it did not end in a double explosion.

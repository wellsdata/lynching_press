No Grand Jury Indictments.
Indianapolis Journal.
Special to the
OSGOOD Ind., Sept. 24 .-- The Ripley
,
county grand jury has adjourned and no
indictments were returned against the
members of the mob which lynched the
Osgood gang last week at Versailles. This
is a surprise to no one, as it was not expected
from the start that they would find
any evidence to connect any one with the
crime. Judge New discharged the jury yesterday
. This is expected to close the case
unless Governor Mount takes action.
Mrs. Lulu Jenkins, wife of one of the
mob victims, who had been arrested with
Mrs. Rittenhouse last week by deputies,
after a search of the two women's houses
for stolen property, had her hearing yesterday
and was discharged by order of Prosecutor
Connelly. There was no
against Mrs. Jenkins evidence

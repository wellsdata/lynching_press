COMES HOME TO THE EAST.
In no state do the people have more
to say about the down trodden negro
of the south than in Massachusetts.
Everytime a negro rape fiend is lynched
in the south the eastern press
abuses the south with a venom that
is fearful, and the Masachusetts press
is the most rabid of all. When Roose-
velt undertook to force an objectionable
negor woman as postmistress
on the people of Indiano-
la, Miss .. and the white
people
protested, the eastern newspapers upheld
the megalomaniac in the presidential
chair, and denounced the In-
dianola people in severest terms. The
newspapers of Massachusetts threw
hysterical fits, and some of them actually
shrieked that the rebels of the
south had not yet been subdued.
But" chickens are coming home to
roost" with those easterners who pretend
to have such. a tender affection
for the negro, and especially to those
" nigger equality" Massachusetts folks.

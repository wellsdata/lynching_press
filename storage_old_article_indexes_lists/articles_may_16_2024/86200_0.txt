Another Brinckley Case.
A Divorce suit and its tragic end.
A Newman( Ga,) paper of a recent
date gives the details of the killing of
Mrs L. B. Brinckley in that town by
her husband. Additional interest is
given to it by the fact that the murder
er is the uncle of the Mr. Hugh Law-
son Brinckley whose wife secured a
verdict of divorce, in New York on
Wednesday. From the details is learned
of
himself, his wife and four children.
The husband and father is said to be a
totising
dissipat man da burd
family, frequently maltreating them so
badly as to cause police interference.
Last winter he was indicted but acquit
ted of assault upon his wife with intent
to commit murder. The narrative of
the tragedy is thus told by the local
journal
As we:
As we have before stated, immediately
after the acquittal and release of S.
B. Brinckley, at the last March term of
the Superior Court, a ticket to Mem
phis, Tenn, was furnished him, and he
took his departure for that place, ostensibly
, but whither he went is not
positively known in this community
He has a brother living in Memphis
who is said to be wealthy and an estimable
gentleman. A few days ago he
made his appearance in Newnan, remained
here a short time and then went
to the country. On Wednes' ay evening
last he returned to town, and about 3
o'clock bought a pocket knife from one
of our merchants. He then went directly
to the store of his wife. Scarcely
had he entered the store when loud
screams were beard, and a number of
neighbors immediately ran to ascertain
the cause of the screams, when they
door
met at the the
were dying
wo
man as she rushed into the street in her
fight from her assailant, with her life
blood gushing from six wounds inflicted
by the man who had sworn to love
and protect her, either four of which
would have been fatal. She had scarcely
reached the street before she sank to
the ground. She was followed by her
little children, who, in their fright and
desperation, clung to her until they
were literally bathed in their mother's
blood.
Mr. Brinckley was of course immediately
arrested, when it was found
that he had apparently made an effort
to take his own life, having inflicted
four slight wounds in the lower part of
his abdomen, none of them extending
through the hollow. Mrs. Brinkley's
wounds consisted of one stab in her
breast, two in her back, one in each
arm, and one in the side -- four of which
penetrated to the cavity. The unfor
tunafe woman lived about two hours,
and
and died in great agony. A large
excited crowd collected on the streets.
and lynch law was freely talked of.
So exasperated had our people become
that many of our very best citizens
were open in their advocacy of the
immediate lynching of the man who
dyed his hands in the blood of his
wife. A conference of some of the
calmner of our citizens was held, and
they determined to do everything in
their power to prevent any act that
would add another crime to that which
had already been committed. Mayor
Berry issued a proclamation calling
upon good citizens to unite in putting
down and discouraging anything like
lawlessness. At length better counsels
seemed to prevail, and the crowd gradually
dispersed. As a precautionary
measure, however, the Newman Guards,
Captain J W. Anderson commanding,
were out for the purpose of
guarding called the jail during the night.

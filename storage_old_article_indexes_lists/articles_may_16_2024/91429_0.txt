The Mayor of a South Carolina Town
Killed by a Negro- The Murderer
Arrested and the Jail Surrounded in
by a Mob.
SPARTANBURG, S. C., Sept. 27.-J. Hen-
neman, the mayor of the city, was this
of
evening shot down without warning. The
murderer is in jail in momentary expectan- of
cy of being lynched. A burly negro, John
Williams, was making a disturbance at ed
home with his wife. Cries of all sorts were
heard from that direction, Mayor Henneman
I went to the house to find out the cause.
He arrested Williams and was trying to
prevent his escape until the police came to
his assistance. Williams succeeded in$
pushing Henneman out of the door, and
while he was falling shot him in the back,
killing him instantly. To say the town
was excited does not begin to express it.
Groups of excited men are gathered all
over the city, talking of nothing but this
in
outrage. At this time( 8 p. m.) the jail is
surrounded by a howling mob and lacks
only a leader to the prisoner
procure.
There is no doubt but that South Carolina
will another lynching to her list tonight
add.

Bu Times Special
MARION, Ind., Aug. 9.- With army precision, double
guards in the khaki of the Indiana national' guard today
patrolled the Negro section of Marion, while the Saturday
county seat crowds, peaceful to all outward appearances, discussed
rumors of threatening racial strife as a result of the
double lynching of two Negroes Thursday night.
Rumors that a large number of Negroes were being
mobilized at Indianapolis to aid Marion's 1,800 Negroes in
retaliation for the double hanging were current, but were discounted
by officials.
Groups of curious persons poured into the city from surrounding
small towns and the country districts today. In
early morning hours downtown streets were crowded.
Acutely aware of an undercurrent of racial antagonism
which they fear might flame into open warfare over the weekend
officials concentrated their efforts today on preventing
gatherings, of groups of whites or Negroes.

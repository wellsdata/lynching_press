Believed to Have Been Lynched.
GUTHRIE, Ok., May 17.- It was reported
here yesterday that on Sunday
night a posse of men called at the
Dunn ranch, where the outlaws, New-
comb and Pierce, were killed two
weeks ago, and took John, Calvin and
William Dunn away with them, and
that no trace can be found of the
brothers. It is the general opinion in
that section that all three of them
have been lynched, but whether the
job was done by citizens or by friends
of the dead bandits who came to
avenge their comrades, it is hard to
tell. There are conflicting
stories. many

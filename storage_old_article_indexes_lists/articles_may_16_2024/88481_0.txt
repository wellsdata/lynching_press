Washington, August 8.- The state department
has received from the Italian authorities
a copy of the complete report
made by the Marquis Romano, secretary of
the Italian embassy here, on his personal
investigation of the recent lynching of five
Italians at Tallulah, La. The report presents
the affair in a serious light. As a
whole the Italian authorities view the matter
of the lynching as one of unusual
atrocity and without the mitigating circumstances
which had been urged in previous
affairs of this kind.
In describing the first affray, which led
up to the lynching, Marquis Romano's report
states that Dr. Hodges was the first
to draw his weapon and that until he had
fired one shot and was about to fire the
second one at Charles Defata, who was at
that time prostrate on the ground, did the
brother, Joe Defata, fire this shotgun
the store nearby. from

"There were three other boys in
the automobile following us. At
the wheel of our car was the High
Sheriff of Decatur and beside him
was the deputy who was cut. Atter
a while this deputy said, "Waldron
has been talking to you; if you had
done what he wanted you-all would
have been tried and let off with a
light sentence-not more than ten
years,'

and SO did Clarence. He said:
Who was it that got you the knife
-it must have been those bastard
of lawyers, Leibowitz or Watts that
smuggled he knife into the court-
house.*
"I said:
"No, Powell got the knife on a
little roof over the cell, which we
could reach if we climbed
up on
the door of the cells. He found a
magazine there too.'
"The High Sheriff then said: '1

When Roy Wright told us about
the alleged statement of Waldrop's
about changing lawyers, Mr. Lei:
bowitz called to the three deputies
in the corridor to come to Wright's
cell and he asked Roy Wright to
repeat in their presence what he
had told us. He did so.
We then asked Norris, who, dur-

been listening to the conversation,
if he had heard all that had been
sald. He said he had, and that ev
erything Roy had told us was the
truth. Among other things Roy
told us, but on which we did not
make notes, were the following:
That at no time did he have a
knife, nor that at any time did
Sheriff Sandlin grapple with him.
He also told us about Clarence

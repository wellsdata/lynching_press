The state of Georgia is in disgrace
thru the act of one of its many mobs.
The state was in bad odor as a law
the
abiding commonwealth before
Frank case. It capped the climax of
its bad repute, however, when its anarchists
raided penitentiary and
lynched a prisoner a.
So much for the physical effect upon
the state. The moral slump is incalculable
. The success of the lawless
mob that tore Frank from the hands of
the commonwealth and did mob murder
upon a man who belonged to the state
of Georgia under her statutes will bear
fruit in other lynchings and in a general
disregard of law. Lawlessness
breeds lawlessness true to and
feather. type
fact that there were no dead lawbreakers
at the gates. But none of
the mob will be punished. When in a
community like Iowa a mob can hang
an old man from a bridge, and a self
constituted posse hunt down and killing
an inoffensive and harmless negro on a
hint that he may be a criminal without
serious consequences to themselves,
it is to expect punishment of the
mob idle that lynched Frank.

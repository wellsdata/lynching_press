FOR MURDER
( Continued HELD from Page One)
tonight they lie on slabs in the morgue
by the side of the body of Patrolman
Jeff Evans, their victim.
Disapprove Prison Farm.
The news of the lynching spread
rapidly, and despite the heavy rain
that was falling a large crowd went to
the bridge to view the bodies of the
two Mexicans before they were taken
down by is said that
the coroner It
.
some one on the bridge made the re-
mark that" Governor Shoup would not
send those two men to the Avondale
prison farm."
This was taken to indicate that a
large portion of the mob was made up
of farmers from the Avondale district,
19 miles east of Pueblo, where the
prison farm is located. Con-
state
siderable has been at-
controversy
tached to the location of this farm at
Avondale and efforts have been made
by citizens of Pueblo county to have
the farm removed. They declare it is
a menace to have convicts released
there for work on the farm without
adequate guards.
Also, the murdered policeman once
resided on a farm in the Avondale district
and had a large number of friends
among the farmers of that region.
On July 23, Governor Shoup commuted
the sentence of Clifford
Sproules, sentenced from this county
to death for the murder of W. W.
Green, a turnkey at the county jail.
This has aroused the sentiment of the
citizens of Pueblo county against such
commutation of sentences and since
there have been ten murders in this
city and county since the commutation
of Sproul's sentence, there have been
numerous reports that some day the
citizens of this county would take the
law in their own hands and punish
persons guilty of murder.
As to the citizenship of the two
Mexicans, little is known here. But it
is said that they frequently have made
boast that they were citizens of
the Mexico, and soldiers in Villa's army.

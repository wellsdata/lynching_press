Claim Congress Watching
Lynch Sheriff's Trial
.....
MONTGOMERY, Ala., June 17.-(Special.) During the recent impeachment trial be-
fore, the Alabama Supreme Court of Sheriff J. L. Corbitt, of Henry County on charges
growing out of the taking from the county jail at Abbeville by a mob and lynching, on the
night of Feb. 1, of Wes Johnson, Negro farm hand-persistent rumors were in circulation
here that trial of the sheriff was
being closely watched by officials
and members of Congress in Wash-
ington, where Federal anti-lynch-
ing legislation is and has been for
some time, one of the major con-
troversial subjects before the Fed-
eral law-making body.
During his final argument before
the Supreme Court at conclusion of
his vigorous prosecution of the.
charges brought against the sheriff,
Attorney General Albert A. Car-
michael warned that if the State
of Alabama does not enforce its
constitutional provisions against
lynchng, Congress will do some-
thing about it by passing an anti-
lynching bill. This statement
strengthened the probability, it was
believed, that the rumors of inter-
est in the proceedings at Washing-
ton were founded on fact.
Despite the four to two verdict
of the Supreme Court, acquitting
the sheriff, the opinion is wide-
spread here that not only will the
prompt and determned action of
Gov. Bibb Graves and the Attor-
ney General in officially investigat-
ing the lynching, filing impeach-
ment charges against the sheriff
and seeing to it that they were
prosecuted with the utmost vigor,
have a wholesome effect on other
sheriffs in the state, but will con-
vince Federal authorities of the
sincerity of efforts of the official-
dom of the state to ban lynching
from Alabama.

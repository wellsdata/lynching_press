Fruit. Good Tree
FT. WAYNE, Ind., March 29.- Yesterday a
brutal looking negro called at the house of
John L. Boshet, ten miles west of the city, and
finding Mrs. Boshet alone, sprang upon her,
threw her to the floor, and assaulted her.
He threatened her life if she made any outery
until he was safely out of the. vicinity. As
soon as she dared she called her husband, who
was working some distance away. A posse
of armed farmers was quickly organized,
and they have been searching for the negro
but so far in vain.,

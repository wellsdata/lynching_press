One of the men said that all ne-
groes were fleeing from Springfield,
as their lives were not safe there.
He stated that the greatest wrath of
the mob was directed against the
lower and" tougher" negro element,
but that the colored people of all
classes were fleeing for their lives
since the mob might lynch them at
moment while in its present state
of any mind.

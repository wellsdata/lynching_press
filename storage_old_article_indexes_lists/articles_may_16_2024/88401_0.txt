period of bridge burning. This coupled

the two men who were forced by the
mob to confess to burning bridges
that were not guilty of burning, leads
to one of two conclusions:
One conclusion is that some tool of
the M.& N. A. railway burned the
bridge in order to furnish an excuse
for mob rule, as the scab shopmen
were unable to keep the rolling stock

had to be done to drive the
Union shopmen back to work.

fireboxes of the locomotives were
bad repair, so as to scatter fire all
along the track. thus setting fire to
the wooden trestles. It is possible
that this did some of the damage but

show that it was all a deep- laid and
villainous plot of the open shop interests

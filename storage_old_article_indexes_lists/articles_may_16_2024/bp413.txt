State's Attorney Probes Police
Part In Dual Florida Lynching
Checking of Pistols Found On Scene May Im-
plicate or Vindicate County Officials;
Governor Says Just "Plain Murder”
TALLAHASSEE, Fla., (ANP)--
Possibility that police officers were
the lynchers last week of Richard
Hawkins and Ernest Ponder, 18
years old colored boys, was being
"investigated" by State's Attorney
Orion C. Parker, Jr., who ordered a
complete check of the calibre and
serial numbes of all police pistols.
The two youths, charged with
stabbing Patrolman V. K. Kelly
Sunday night, July 18, were kid-
naped from the county jail near the
state capitol, taken to the country,
and shot to death.
The quartet of lynchers, with pa-
per bags over their heads, entered
police headquarters where Harry
Fairbanks, night police sergeant,
was alone, and said: "We want the
jail keys and we don't want any
damn foolishness."
NO RESISTANCE
When they told him that, he got
up and gave them the keys with-
out offering any resistance. Nor
did he call for help when the men
made him use the keys to open the
jail door and get other keys which
would open a series of doors be-
tween the jail office and the cell
blocks where the two youths were
held.
Fairbanks said he did not cry out
because of the gun pointed at him
and because the men bound and
gagged him before leaving with
their victims.
Parker probed the possibility of
police duplicity when Chief Pow-
ledge told the coroner's jury Tues-
day of last week that only police-
men and sheriff's deputies were
supposed to know that a set of keys
was kept at police headquarters.
CHECKING PISTOLS
The state's attorney said he was
checking on police pistols "so thati
if policemen are implicated we can
establish it and if they are not im-
plicated the evidence will clearly
exonerate."

made this statement from the near-
by capital as he demanded a "com-
plete investigation" before the cor-
cner's jury decided to make no
definite findings pending a further
probe.

Sheriff Frank Soutamire's in-
quest testimony also indicated po-
lice duplicity when he said he pick-

two of 32 near the spot where the
bodies were found. He added that

policemen used „38's,

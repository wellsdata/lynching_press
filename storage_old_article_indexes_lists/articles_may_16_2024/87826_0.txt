The two previous nights and yesterday

results were anticipated as those within

by the negro, will not recover

complications are apprehended. While the

scenes of lawlessness and blood- shed yet

her home in this city, near the court
house. Mrs. Gaumer was prostrated. She
felt the disgrace and requested her son
to announcet hat she was assaulted for
robbery. It was given out that Mitchell
attempted to force her to sign a check
for$ 500. But as Mrs. Gaumer's condition
became more sérious the facts became
known and also that the negro was
afflicted with a loathsome disease. Mitch-
ell was first held for robbery, but on last
Wednesday he was arraigned for criminal
assault. Mrs. Gaumer was unable to
appear in court, and the hearing was
held at her home. As Mitchell entered
her room she raised up in bed and ex-

dare you face me again you brute."
Soon after the identification on Wed-
nesday there was talk of lynching.
Crowds surrounded the jail that night and
the sheriff and local militia had trouble
in protecting the prisoner. Yesterday,
a grand jury was impannelled and it soon
returned an indictment for criminal assault
. Mitchell, disguised in a soldier's
uniform, was brought last night from jail
into court. He waived the reading of the
indictment, plead giulty and was prompt-
sentenced to twenty years in the peni-
tiary, the limit for criminal assault.
trial was over before nine o'clock
night, when an attempt was made to
Mitchell to Columbus on the train
p. m. But the crowds were about
urt house and jail and when the
drove up, the crowd made a
the jail. The military drove
back, but the crowd soon in-
e n fury as well as numbers, so
that Sheriff McLean and the troops had
all they could do to hold the jail, and
the trip to Columbus was given up before
the departure of the last train.
It was 1:30 a. m. when the first attack
was made on the jail. The soldiers opened
fire on the mob and twenty volleys
were poured into the advancing crowd.
Two were killed and nine wounded. The
attacking party retired but the sight of
the dead and injured infuriated them and
the crowd soon rallied.
The final attack on the jail was made
at 7 o'clock this morning. The local company
, which did the shooting, had been
on duty for two nights and a request was
sent to Governor Bushnell for reinforcements
. He ordered a company from
Springfield to the scene and they arrived
before 7 o'clock. Mayor Ganzon met the
soldiers and sent them back to the depot,

soon found
A rope was thrown around the negro's
neck and he was dragged out. When the
outer door was reached the noose slipped,
but it was soon replaced and the condemned
man was hurried into the yard.
The rope was then thrown over one of
the limbs of a tree. Mitchell was jerked
up until his head struck the limb. His
neck was broken and his body dropped to
the ground. The crowd repeated the jerking
several times until they were sure
he was dead. There is some doubt as to
what occurred inside the jail from midnight
until the time of the lynching. The
facts, as near as can be arrived at, are as
follows:
When the first attack was made on the
mounted
jail at 1:30 a. m. a dozen men
the rear step and two of them used a
sledge hammer on the doors. The local
militia company was under arms on the
inside with Sheriff McLain and his deputies
. Capt. George W. Leonard stepped
out and said:" I will give you three minutes
to disperse. If you do not do so I
must fire."
The crowd generally believed that Sheriff
McLain had already ordered the troops
to fire and they dispersed. But when the
attack was renewed on the rear door of
the jail with sledge hammers, the firing
took place and the crowd dispersed,
leaving their dead and wounded. It was
after three o'clock when Sheriff McLain
telegraphed Governor Bushnell, at Woos-
ter, Ohio, that a mob had attacked the
jail, that he had opened fire, that his
force was inadequate and that assist-
ance was needed at once.
The colored people are greatly excited
over the affair. They had previously met
and adopted resolutions for the punish-
ment of Mitchell, but many of them
talked about him not being guilty. Women
children, as well as a multitude of men,
witnessed the lyching. There was no attempt
at disguise or secrecy. An hour or
more after the lynching, Mitchell's body
was picked up and placed in a rough
coffin, but left under the tree, where
hundreds of people continued to view it.
Later in the day the body was removed
by the coroner and other traces of the violence
were removed as fast as possible.
Meantime, crowds of people poured into
the city from all surrounding towns and
viewed the blood stained steps of the jail
and the marks of the bullets on the surrounding
houses. Among the sights shown
visitors was a tree in the same court
house yard where a man named Ullery
was lynched twenty- three years ago, for
a similar crime the 7- year- old

was burst open with a log and the sheriff
surrendered the keys and no lives were
lost except that of the culprit The tree is
still standing, but the limb on which Ul-
lery was hung is dead.
Governor Bushnell arrived here tonight
investigate the trouble and
to
especially the action of the troops. While
the Urbana company is overwhelmed
with local sentiment against their ac-
tion, they are also liable for abandoning
their post of duty. Capt. Leonard with-
drew the guards about 7 a. m., and the
Springfield company took orders from the
mayor instead of the sheriff, when they
turned back from the court house.
Governor Bushnell was attending an
encampment at Woodster last night and
was met by a delegation from here on his
return to Columbus this afternoon. The
citizens asked for protection by troops of
Sheriff McLain against whose life threats
had been freely made during the after-
noon, and if he was here tonight it is
believed there would be trouble again.
Sheriff McLain left here at 8 p. m. and
arrived at Springfield at 3 p. m., en
route to Dayton. He escaped by the
back door of the jail and claims that
dynamite was being prepared to blow
him up. In the excitement and bitterness
that prevails tonight it is almost impossible
to get at the facts as to the responsibility
for the loss of life, but it is generally
claimed that Sheriff McLain ordered
the troops to fire.
It is believed there will be a thorough
investigation into the action of he mayor
as well as into the action of the sheriff
and military officers.
Mrs. Gaumer is the widow of a well-
known newspaper publisher. Her brothers
- in- law are D. H. Gaumer, publisher
of the Zanesville Signal and an ex- State
Senator, and C. N. Gaumer, formerly
publisher of the Mansfield Shield and an
ex- State Representative.
Mitchell was 23 years old and a hotel
porter. He bought milk at the dairy of
Mrs. Gaumer and knew she was alone
while her children were at school..He
deliberately studied his opportunity for
assaulting her.
It is learned tonight that Sheriff Me-
Lain and Capt. Leonard left this after-
noon at the request of citizens, who feared
they were in danger of violence tonight
. They took supper at Springfield
and left at 7:30 on the Big Four express
for Cincinnati, but would not tell where
were going. After the fatalities of
they the night, it is known that Sheriff Mc-
Lain and Capt. Leonard decided before
daylight that there would be no more
shooting. The guards were removed and
the militia went from the jail to their
homes in citizens' clothes. Before this
evacuation the keys of the jail were
thrown from a window to the mob.
Mayor Ganson ordered Mitchell's body
removed immediately after the lynching
but so strong was the feeling that the
crowd would not allow the police to touch
the coffin till after dark tonight, when the
body removed to some unknown
place. was

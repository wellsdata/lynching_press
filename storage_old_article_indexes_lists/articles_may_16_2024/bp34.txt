MOB LYNCHED WRONG
MAN, PROBERS BELIEVE
Futile Attempt Is Made to Discover Guilty
Persons in Virginia Outrage.
WYTHEVILLE, Va., Sept. 9.-The special grand jury in-
vestigating the lynching of Raymond Bird, August 15, was ad-
journed suddenly late Friday afternoon by Judge Horace
Sutherland and will not be resumed until September 16. The
jurist is scheduled to open court Monday in Pulaski county.
The investigators, according to ang
annuoncement, have received some
encouragement in their attempts to
ascertain the identity of the mem-
bers of the mob which stormed the
jail in this city and killed Bird.
New evidence will be introduced be-
fore the grand jury when it recon-
venes and it is hoped it will be pro-
ductive of results.
Two Women Testify.
Seven witnesses, two of them
women, testified before the grand
jury Friday. The women are Mrs.
J. D. Fisher and her daughter, Miss
Lottie Fisher, who live in Rural Re-
treat, which is located in the western
part of Wythe county, near the
home of the young white woman
Bird is alleged to have criminally
assaulted and for which crime he
was under arrest when lynched.
Forty-seven witnesses have been
summoned. Of this number, 19 have
been questioned by the grand jury,
the others having been dismissed
after a preliminary cross-examina-
tion by Leon M. Basille, assistant
attorney general; Joseph H. Chit-
wood, Roanoke attorney, and S. M.
Heuser, Commonwealth's Attorney
of Wythe county.
Rope Secured From Farmer,
When the grand jury opened its
session 'the members asked for the
rope with which Bird's body was
hanged to a tree nine miles from
this city. It had not been con-
fiscated by the authorities, but was
obtained from a farmer living near
where the body was found. The rope
was similar to the kind used in
grain binding operations and vir-
tually every farmer in the county
has a supply of it, according to court
officials. The knot with which it
was placed around the Negro's neck,
was what is generally known as a
hangman's knot, regarded as difficult
to tie.

Tree Brought to Wytheville.
The tree, a small slender oak, up-
on which the body was hanged was
cut down and brought to Wytheville.
It bears the letters "H" and "H,"
one of which is cut beneath the
other, and the initials "R. B." The
tree is being kept at the Wythe
county courthouse,
vestigation is being held.
W. C. Kincer, sheriff and his two
deputies, who cut the body down
and turned it over to an undertak-
ing establishment for burial, said
they had not noticed the letters or
the initials in the tree when they
first visited the scene.
Bird was in custody on a warrant
charging him with criminally as-
saulting the daughter of a farmer,
who lives near the place where the
body was found. It is the general
belief in Wytheville that Bird would
not have been found guilty of the
crime charged.
Governor Byrd Interested.
The grand jury was summoned by
Judge Horace Sutherland of the 21st
Judicial district. At the direction of
Governor Byrd, Leon M. Bazille, as-
sistant attorney-general, and Joseph
H. Chitwood, Roanoke attorney, are
aiding in the investigation.
The residents of this city are
aroused over the publicity given the
lynching and the alleged delay in
sumtioning a jury to probe the case.
They do not believe, however, the in-
vestigators will obtain sufficient evi-
dence to present indictments. It is
their contention the lynching was
prepetrated by "country
**
folks,
whose identity will never become
known.
Except five, the sheriff and his
two deputies, the jailor, who was
present when Bird was killed, and
andertaker, all the witnesses are
from the section of the county where
the young woman, who is alleged to
have been assaulted, and the Negro,
lived.
It is hoped that by questioning
persons who knew both principals,
several members of the mob may be
identified. It was admitted late Wed-
nesday night, however, that no tang-
ible evidence had been secured from
the cross-examination of seven
witnesses.
The investigation was conducted
in the Wythe County courthouse.
The questioning was done behind
closed doors and the jurors have
been asked to keep secret everything
which occured.
Could Have Prevented It.
A number of persons in Wythe-
ville declare the lynching could have
been prevented if the precautions
suggested by W. C. Kincer, sheriff,
had been followed. It was only
through strategy of the sheriff and
his two deputies, it was pointed out,
that Bird was saved from a mob the
night of his arrest, August 7.
The prisoner was spirited from
the neighborhood in which he was
taken in custody and brought to
Wytheville. The sheriff notified H.
M. Heuser, Commonwealth's at-
torney, of the attitude of persons
who knew of the case and asked that
the prisoner be moved to a safer
place. Mr. Heuser, it is said, did
not think there was any danger and
the man was not moved.
Aroused By Attacks.
The Wytheville jail is situated in
the western section of the city in a
more or less secluded spot. The mob
had little difficulty in overpowering
the lone guard and obtaining access
tothe prisoner.
The criticism which the affair has
aroused and the editorial attacks on
the county, which have appeared in
virtually all newspapers of the
Couth, appear to have aroused the
residents of this section more than
the actual lynching itself.

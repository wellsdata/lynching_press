Ga., Aug. 9-(Special:)
Immediate suppression of mob vi-
folence and lynching, more gene-
rous provision for Negro education
and the employment of colored
farm and home demonstration a-
egents to teach the people how to
make a living under boll wevil
conditions were the most important
steps urged by the Georgia Race
Relations Committee, not only as
matters of justice but also as cs-
sential to stop the northward mi-
gration of Negroes. The Commit-
tee, in session here a few days ago,
called upon the authorities to do
their utmost to put down mob vio-
lence, and all good citizens were
urged to stand behind the officers
and the courts in all efforts to this
end. Attention was called also to
the need of giving the governor au-
thority to deal effectively with
sheriffs, who are delinquent in
their duties.
The legislature was asked to pro-
vide more generously for colored
schools of higher grade and each
county was urged to build at least
one good school of this character.
The Committee called attention
to the valuable work done by the
few colored farm and home dem-
onstration agents in the state, and
the emplyment of such agents in
every county was recommended as
a means of teaching the people
how to make a living under boll
weevil conditions.
The Committe asked the legis-
lature to appropriate $15,000 for
a training school for delinquent
girls and also emphasized the need
for a state tuberculosis sanitari-
um for colored patients.
It was reported that the woman's
section of the committee had sc-
cured funds for the employment of i
a colored public health nurse to
work throughout the state, orga-
nizing and training groups to look a
after maternal and infant welfare.

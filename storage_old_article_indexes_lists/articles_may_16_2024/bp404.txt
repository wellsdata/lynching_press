THE ANTI-LYNCH BILL
By Douglas Lavoisier Conner
Eureka High School
Hattiesburg, Miss.
I consider the strong opposition
to the tactics of those who are op-
posing the Anti-Lynch Bill the best
Negro news of the month. The ma-
jority of people in the United
States, including whites, are in fav-
or of the Anti-Lynch Bill. The
daily newspapers of the nation are
for this great bill. Even the ma-
jority of southern white people and
newspapers of the South are in
favor of the bill. Lynching should
be dropped from the earth as it
| carries from the United Mates of
America and other nations a toll
of many deaths annually. Until the
United States wakes up and sees
that the vile way of mob-murdering
men tends to detour the progress of
the nation, she will suffer the con-
sequences. As long as lynching is
not prohibited by the enforcement
of the law, any man's life stands in
danger. I believe that we as a
nation should not be guilty of tol-
crating the practice of vile mob
murder of men.
MISSISSIPPI HIGH COURT
SEALS MITCHELL'S DEATH
By Charles J. Sampley, Jr.,
Barber High School
Annison, Ala.
The most outstanding news of the
month appeared in the November 27
issue of the Pittsburgh Courier,
"Mississippi High Court Seals
Mitchell's Death."
Mitchell, a white man, was con-
victed of robbing an old Negro of
his savings. He knocked the man
and his son into insensibility with
a black jack and then burned down
their dwelling upon them. Mitchell
was arrested and sentenced to death
in the electric chair. It is the first
time since reconstruction days that
a white man has been convicted for
the murder of a Negro.
In giving the Mississippi Supreme
Court opinion on the case. Justice
Griffith described it as "the most
atrocious crime ever committed in
all over the
the state."
Negroes
country should take note of the
case. It shaws that even southern
white men do not approve of such
lawlessness done to the race. It
proves that all men, such as Mitch-
ell. cannot take the life of another
without paying for it even if he is
a gro in Mississippi.
Mitchell has tried to have his
case appealed on a plea of insanity.
The court refused this plea. It
fixed Friday, December 17. 1937, as
the day for the execution. Gov.
White has washed his hands of the
case. There is nothing now to de
lay the execution. This sentence, if
carried out, will open a new chap-
ter in the Negro's Treatment in
Mississippi.

Four Negroes Lynched.
Four negroes were lynched at Pon-
chatoula the other night. They were
suspected of burglarizing the residence
of Henry Hatfielder, whose
home is in Tangipahoa parish. The
victims were: Isaiah Rollins, aged 18;
Nathaniel Bowman, aged 47; George
Charles Elliott
Bickham aged 22;,
,
aged 20. It is said there has been an
epidemic of burglaries in the lower
section of Tangipahoa parish of late.
A vigilance committee was long ago
formed for the purpose of taking
summary action when the opportunity
presented itself. The opportunity
came, when Henry Hatfielder reported
that his residence had been entered
the night before and robbed of
$ 250. As soon as the facts were known
the authorities acted with promptness
, arrested 14 suspects during the
day. These were confined in the small
jail. During the day there was suppressed
excitement in the town, and
it was evident that some of the ne-
groes would be severely dealt with.
At night the doors of the jail were
broken open, and the four negroes,
who had been selected by the mobs
as the guilty ones, were taken out and
hanged to the limbs of a large oak
tree which stands near the jail. The
people of Ponchatoula, both white
and black, deplore the action of the
mob, and both races in massmeeting
appointed a law- and- order

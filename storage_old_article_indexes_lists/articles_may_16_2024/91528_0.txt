NEGRO CIRCUSMAN TAKEN FROM
JAIL AND LYNCHED TODAY
( Special from United Press,)
Frankfort, Ky., June 3.- Within
sight and sound of the Governor's
mansion, John Maxie, a negro attache
of Howe's Circus, after escaping death
at the hands of a mob of his own
race, was taken from jail early to- day
by a white mob and lynched from a
bridge over the Kentucky river. Max-
ie was discovered by Bert C. Bowers,
Wichitka, Mass., in the act of ripping
the canvas and when ordered to desist
, turned on Bowers and shot him
in the abdomen. A mob of colored la-
borers attacked Maxie when local officials
succeeded in getting him away
and placing him in jail. While further
attempts at lynching were feared
, nothing was done to prevent it
and at 1:30 A. M. a mob of white
masked men went to the jail and took
the negro to the bridge.
There, while the negro pleaded for
his life, a rope was placed around his
neck and as he was swung from over
a beam of an electric light pole, his
body was riddled with bullets. Following
the lynching Governor Wilson,
whose mansion was close enough to
hear the shots fired, was called from
bed by telephone and informed of the
occurrence. He stated, however, that
he knew of no reason why he should
be disturbed over a purely local affair
.
Bowers, the white man who
was
shot, is probably fatally injured. He
is a member of the Elks at Valdosta
Ga., his former home.,

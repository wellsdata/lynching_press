MOB, MURDER BENT
PURSUES PORTER
Spokane, Oct. 13- Pursned by a
mob, that threatenes to lynch him, a
negro porter employed on the Northern
Pacific is fleeing for his life as
the result of the attack made by him
on Oscar Travis this morning. Travis
was a passenger on the overland
train arriving here this morning and
as he was stepping from the train he
was attacked by the porter who at-
tempted to do murder.
The attack grows out of a quarrel
between Travis and the porter as the
result of some misdeed of the porter's
while the train was enroute from the
east. Travis believed that the affair
was forgotten and was caught entirely
unawares by the porter when the
latter made his attack. The assault
was witnessed by a number of men,
who when they found out that Travis
is seriously injured vowed
and started in search of the vengeance negro.

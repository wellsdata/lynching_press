B. J. Parish's two boys, aged 12 and 14 years,
died suddenly. It now turns out that they
were poisoned by a negro named Newton Carpenter
, living with Parish at the time, who put
poison in water which the boys drank. Carpenter
confided the matter to a colored wo
man, who a few days ago told Parish what she
knew about the death of his boys. Carpenter
was got the
a negro doctor, Ned Mack, a notorious character
, and Mack was also arrested.
A posse of half a dozen men took them in
charge and started for jail, but when about
seven miles from here the prisoners were
seized by a mob of disguised men and hanged.
Carpenter said that it was his intention at the
time to poison the whole family. He said he
was glad the matter had come to light, as he
not had a sound night's sleep since he
had committed the crime.

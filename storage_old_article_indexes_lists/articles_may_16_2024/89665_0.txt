SHOT HIS DAUGHTERS.
The Bloody Crime of a Former Indianapolis
Tailor, Who Narrowly Escapes Lynching.
A dispatch from Erie, Pa., states that Christian
F. Schau, who moved from this city to Erie
five years ago, shot his daughter, Minnie, killing
her instantly, and then shot and fatally wounded
his second daughter, Annie. The family were
seated at the supper table, when he arose from
his chair and drew a revolver, saying he
was going to kill his wife. The daughters
interfered, and when his wife ran
out of the room, he shot them. He attempted
to escape, and when nearly overtaken made an
unsuccessful attempt to take his own life. After
he had been arrested a mob attempted to lynch
him, but were prevented by the police. Schau
was a tailor, and during his several years residence
here he worked for a number of firms, and
for a time ran a shop of his own. He was continually
abusing his wife, who would never let
the police molest him for his misconduct. In 1874
William Dietrichs, who was then a justice of the
peace, had a warrant sworn out for Schau's arrest
, for wife- beating. The wife, as usual, sided
with her husband and the case against him was
not proven in court. He entered suit against
Mr. Dietrichs for$ 1,000 damages for false imprisonment
, and secured a judgment for$ 500.
Dietrichs appealed the case to the Supreme
Court Mr., where the decision was affirmed.

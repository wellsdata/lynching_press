GOOD METHODIST CHURCH.
The Methodist Church, which is strong
in the Southern states of our Union, as
it is most everywhere in this country,
is not derelict as to taking a stand
against mob violence and lynchings, as
is evidenced by action taken by the
Methodist church in Statesboro, Georg-
ia, regarding the recent lynching case
there.
The Southern Methodist Church, to
its honor, takes the lead in condemnation
and reprobation of these barbaric
deeds of mobs. Slavery, it has been
barbarism but this
said is a relic of,
most recent lynching case is worse
than barbarism. The New York Independent
, in noticing editorially this
recent lynching case remarks:" We
have observed that somehow it is the
Southern Methodist Church that seems
to lead the way toward justice and
fair treatment of all men in the section
where that Church is strong. We have
seen plenty of words, but nowhere have
we seen definite acts more hopeful than
those taken by the Southern Metho-
dist Church in Statesboro, S. C., in reference
to the lynching which took
place there lately, when the sheriff
and the militia showed such coward-
ice. The church has passed unanimous
resolutions calling upon any of its
members to resign from the Church,
unless" public confession wrong
a of
be made ,, with expression of sorrow
and contrition." The pastor of the
church the Rev. Whitely Langston,
,
had the courage to give to the Governor's
Commission of inquiry the names
of several of the lynchers, and he has
been strongly censured for it, but the
church has voted to commend him
his" Christian conduct." for

A NEGRO lynching in Oregon
was hardly to be expected,
one occurred there last Thurs but
day. Negroes who commit criminal
assaults upon white ladies
will be rewarded with the same
penalty in the north as they are
in the south whenever the opportunity
arises, the republican
and a few dirty curs to the
press contrary, notwithstanding.

MOB LAW IN CHILLICOTHE.
We understand that on Saturday last, a
gentleman presented$ 11,000 in notes at the
State of Mis
souri, at Chillicothe, for redemption; but
by the time$ 300 in silver had been paid
him, a crowd of seventy- five persons gathered
in the banking room, and ordered him
to present no more of the bills. They, fur-
thermore, ordered him to leave town and
gave him the rather brief space of five minutes
to do it in. As the crowd was highly
excited, cries of hang him! were heard, the
gentleman thought it the part of prudence,
as not able to
whip a mob of seventy- five men.
His only offence was demanding the payment
of a jusf debt, and if this be a crime
calling for the intervention of Lynch Law,
then every man of the Chillicothe mob,
who goes to a rich man and demands the
holds him
De.money
for a note he against
ought to be lynched.
If the people of Chillicothe persists in
such conduct as this they will degrade the
notes of their Branch, and bring on its ruin.
We have no reason to believe that the
Bank officers did anything to excite this
demonstration. It would be utter suicide
for Bank to countenance such acts.
News any.

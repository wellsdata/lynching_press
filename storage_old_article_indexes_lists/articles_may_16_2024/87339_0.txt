ter, to bring about an adjustment of the quarrel, but the
effort failed, and Mr. Lowe's threat of personal violence
was renewed in writing.
Mr. Maxwell's duties as Prosecuting Attorney require
him to attend the Court which met on Monday last at
Hawesville, the residence of Mr. Lowe, and of course it
was expected that the two gentlemen would then meet.
Much anxiety was felt by their friends, and another effort
was made for the adjustment of the difficulty; but although
we have reason to know that both Mr. Lowe and
Mr. Maxwell were desirous that there should be an adjustment
none was effected.
Naturally a great many persons assembled at Hawes-
ville on Monday in anticipation of an affray, and some,
probably, with a thought of taking part in it. Certainly
a vast number in the town were armed. Matters came to
a orisis on Tuesday.
According to the statement made to us Mr. Maxwell, on
Tue day, was making a speech at the Court House in
Hawesville. Mr. Lowe appeared at the door, denounced
him aloud as a poltroon, and made another remark much
more hard to bear. Mr. Maxwell fired at him. Lowe
returned the fire, and then, in rapid succession, more
than a hundred shots with pistols and guns were tired,
nearly or quite all of them at Lowe. Maxwell, who was
unhurt, desisted aftor his first fire. John Aldridge, a
friend of Lowe, was instantly killed, being shot through
the head and arm; but we are not informed whether he
tired or not. Mr. Miller, a friend of Maxwell, was shot
through the thigh. Lowe was shot in the thigh, and
had the thumb of his right hand shot off, and his clothes,
including his shirt, were entirely riddled. Lowe
retreated to the house of Mrs. Smart, and we presume
that most of the shots fired at him were fired during his
retreat. He was afterwards taken to the jail, and a
strong guard was placed around it to prevent him
being lynched by the populace. from

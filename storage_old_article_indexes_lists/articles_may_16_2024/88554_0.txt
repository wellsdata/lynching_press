NEGROES BARELY
ESCAPE ANGRY MOB
ED HUTCHESON AND HIS WIFE AT
SCOTTSBORO CAUSE INDIGNATION
BY WRITING OBSCENE
LETTER TO YOUNG LADY.
Scottsboro, July 20.( Special.) Ed
Hutcheson, a negro, together with his
was arrested at Stevenson
wife, Rosa,
late yesterday afternoon and brought to
Scottsboro on the midnight train on the
charge of writing an obscene letter to
Miss Foster, the young daughter of
Thomas Foster, ex- tax assessor, and one
of the most prominent men in the county.
It was known that these negroes wrote
the letter and signed the name of John
Rice, another negro, to get revenge. This,
it is said, so infuriated a number of the
citizens of Stevenson that it was feared
a mob would take the negroes and lynch
them.
Sheriff Austin and Solictor Proctor were
at once notified by telephone of the condition
of affairs. The sheriff immediately
instructed the officer that had the ne-
groes to get them away at once, and the
officer brought them to Scottsboro. About
fifty men were closing around them as
they were hustled aboard the train at
Stevenson. The sheriff took charge of
the negroes and put them in jail at once
and heavily armed the guards on duty.
Sheriff Austin and Sollctor Proctor went
to Stevenson this morning to investigate
more fully. Considerable indignation is
felt over the insulting letter mailed to
the young lady by these negroes. It is
thought good counsel will prevail and
lynching be averted. a

NO ACTION WILL BE TAKEN.
Sheriff Told His Deputies Not to Forcibly
Oppose Mob.
Terre Haute, Ind, March 1.- The authorities
of Vigo county are now learning
where they come in on the action
of the mob that hanged and burned
George Ward. The county council has
appropriated$ 10,000 for repairing the
damage done to the jail by them.
A move has been started to raise a
fund for the widowed mother of Miss
Ida Finckelstein. The mother was
almost entirely dependent upon the
daughter for her financial support.
Sheriff Fasig has been holding something
like a public reception, a stream
of people calling to commend him for
telling his deputies not to forcibly oppose
the mob. It is evident that public
sentiment is not fully aroused to
the horrors of the lynching and burning
of George Ward and the demonstration
at the sheriff's office yesterday
indicates that no one will be punished
for the lynching.
The lynching of George Ward has
created wild consternation among the
negroes in this section of the state. As
the excitement decreases among the
white people it increases among the ne-
groes. They are loud in their condemnation
of the Terre Haute mob. Many
negroes have fled from Terre Haute,
fearing a mob may take them in hand.
Nearly all who have left this city have
gone to Brazil. There is a large negro
population there, and the
have been given shelter there. refugees

PASSAGE OF DYER
BILL IMPERATIVE
SAYS VIRGINIAN
( Preston News Service)
WASHINGTON, D. C., Aug. 18.-
Discussing the necessity for the passage
of the Dyer Anti- Lynching bill,
Mr. H. E. Barnett, a Virginian, has the
following to say:" As a former Virgin-
ian I have bowed my head in shame
at the atrocities of the Southland.
Years ago I viewed the victim of a
mob hanging by the neck from an
apple tree. He was gagged, his
clothes torn and his skin lacerated
and bruised b the stones over which
he had been dragged.
" The sight sent cold chills through
me. I saw him many nights after in
my dreams. It was a scene I shall
never forget; and yet all, except the
members of the victim's race, prattled
and giggled as if nothing unusual
had happened.
" Later in the day the body of the
victim was cut down, and the coroner's
jury rendered a verdict that the
victim had come to his death at the
hands of persons unknown- yet well
known to the jury.
" When men by whom the law is enacted
for the betterment of the community
, fail to uphold it, and become
violators of the code under which society
in the state is to be governed,
then the general government should
step forward and vindicate the order
of civilization and pass such a bill as
the Dyer anti- lynching bill, whether it
is thought by pettifoggers to be constitutional
or not. Human rights
superior to state rights." are

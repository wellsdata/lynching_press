MOB'S TERRIBLE DEED
Three Negroes Hanged and Cremated
at Springfield, Mo.
Leaders of Mob Were Not Disguised,
and Worked in Full Glare of
Electric Lights- Militia
on the Scene.
Springfield, Mo- A mob of 3,000
men on Saturday night took two
negroes, Horace Duncan and Jim Cope
land, from the county jail, hanged
them to the statue of the Goddess of
Liberty on the courthouse and built
a fire under them.
The men were charged with attacking
Mable Edmondson, but it is said
they were probably innocent.
At 2:15 o'clock Sunday morning
William Allen, a young negro, was
taken from the county jail and lynched
in the public square by the same
mob that two hours earlier had hanged
Horace Duncan and James Copeland.
The body of Allen later was burned to
ashes as had been those of the other
negroes, beneath the spot where they
had been lynched.
Following the dispatch of Duncan
and Copeland some one suggested that
Allen and Bus Cain, two other negroes
known to be in the jail, should also be
lynched. The mob, now bloodthirsty
and wrought up to the highest pitch of
excitement, readily took up the cry
and soon the charred bones of a third
victim lay beneath the statue of the
Goddess of Liberty. Cain escaped.
Allen and Cain were being held upon
suspicion of having murdered O. P.
Ruark, while Duncan and Copeland
were accused of Ed
mondson.
Their work finally accomplished, the
mob quietly dispersed. But Sunday
crowds augmented by hundreds
persons from surrounding towns, fillo4
the streets, making threats of further
vengeance, and Sunday night several
companies of state militia ordered out
by Gov. Folk, together with 200 deputy
sheriffs patrol the streets.
When the mob left the jail at mid
night with Copeland and Duncan 14
prisoners escaped in the excitement.
Among them was Cain. But Allen was
there yet, and the second mob found
him hiding under a cot. He was
dragged out, his hands were tied be
hind his back, a rope was put around
his neck and he was marched down the
street to the tower in the square and
shared the same fate as his three companions
.
Prosecuting Attorney Patterson and
Sheriff Horner are said to have secured
the names of more than 100 men
who took an active part in the lynching
. The leaders of the mob were not
freighedssed, but worked in the full
glare of the electric lights on the
square. Prosecuting Attorney Patter
son will ask Judge Lincoln of the crim.
inal court to summons a special grand
jury at once and make a most
thorough investigation into the
ing. lynch

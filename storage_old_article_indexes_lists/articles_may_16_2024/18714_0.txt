Very severe punishment has befallen
some bad negroes, Away out in Okla
homa, at Pond Creek, on 26th inst., a
negro named William Campbell was
lynched by a meb of 400 men who broke
to the jail and hanged him to a telegraph
post. He had fatally shot Deputy
Sheriff George Smith. His last
words were:" I I am going home to
glory." He shot his way, he supposed,
into Heaven. At Flavilla, Ga., on the
same day, a negro named Joshua Wal
ton shot down and seriously wounded
Chief of Police Willard. The blood
hounds and a posse are on his trail. At
Bartow, Fla., on 29th, a negro named
Fred Rochelle, criminally assaulted and
then murdered Mrs. Rena Taggart, a
respectable white woman. It was awful
throughout. He was burned at the
stake for his hellish double crime. At
Wilmington, Delaware, a negro named
Ernest Dutton, who poisoned baked
beans eaten by the boarders of a negro
man named Amos Ellegood, was
sentenced to receive sixty lashes and
pay a fine of$ 5,000 and to stand one
hour in the pillory. If he killed any of
his poisoned victims, he should pay a
much heavier penalty. You see that
crime is not sectional. In four outrages
two are out of the south. The sense of
southern humanity is that rape and
murder of white women deserve
death, swift and unerring. Let no tender
- hearted governors ever dare to save
the neck of a brute guilty of such a
hellish crime. We learn from a northern
paper of two other lynchings:" Milton
Calvert, a negro, was lynched at Grif
fith, Miss., on Tuesday, for an at
tempted assault on a young white girl.
He was caught after a short race and
hanged to a oak tree. He confessed the
crime. Another negro was shot to
deat Pheba, near by, for refusing
to leave the country. He had been living
with a white woman, and was repeatedly
ordered to leave. Failing to
go, he was shot by a mob of
whites". dead

NEGRO FIEND LYNCHED.
Mob in Alabama Took Him From
the Courtroom.
Montgomery, Ala., July 16- Yesterday
Major Terrell, a negro, assaulted Mrs.
Martin Thomas, a white woman living in
the country five miles from Elba, Ala. She
was alone in the house with her six months'
old babe.
After the assault the woman was struck
on the head in the bed beside the sleeping
infant. Faggots of pine wood were
then piled upon her by the brute and set
on fire. The flames attracted some passersby
, and they rescued the woman in time to
get her dying statement. The baby was
roasted to death.
Terrell was arrested and was being given
a preliminary trial when a mob broke up
the court and him out and hanged
him took

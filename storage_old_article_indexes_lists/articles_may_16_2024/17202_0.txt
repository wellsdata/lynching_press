GREAT EXCITEMENT IN KANSAS!
Robinson in the hands
Governor
of the Border Ruflians !!
More Lynch Law and more Hanging !!!
WHETHER the Governor is now to be
is uncertain, but one thing is cer.
tain that our large stock of WALL PAPERS have not
escaped hanging, but are" pin'd to the wall," and to
meet the demands of the trade we have just r√©.eived
another large and splendid assortment. Our patterns
are new and beautiful and the prices but a small advance
from the manufacturers. Those in want will
call soon while the assortment is good.

Negro A Murderer Lynched.
CRYSTAL SPRINGS, Miss., Nov. 23.
About half- past 8 o'clock a large and orderless
mob overpowered the officers and took
from them Jack Yarborough, a negro,
putting a rope around his neck they took and
him a short distance into the woods and
banged him to a tree. The crime for which
Yarborough was lynched was the murder
of J. C. Davis in 1892, who was killed while
a gang of negroes was robbing his house.
Three have previously been legally
hanged negroes for this crime.

SPRINGFIELD RIOTERS TO BE
PUNISHED.- ORDER IS MAINTAINED
IN THE CITY BY 3,000
SOLDIERS.
( United Press Service.)
Springfield, Ill., Aug. 17. The
rioters who have held the city in a
reign of terror since Friday have
been checked only by the presence of
over 3,000 soldiers who are heavily
armed. Today the city is in complete
charge of the soldiery. They
patrol the streets and are stationed
at various points of vantage.
On the governor's orders, a special
grand jury will convene tomorrow
to take up the case of George
Richardson, whose alleged assault on
Mrs. Carl Hallam was the cause of
the trouble. After disposing of this
case, the jury has been ordered to investigate
and find out who was responsible
for the riot. One of the
first cases that will be take up will
be that of Abraham Rayman, a Rus
sian Jew, who confessed that he was
one of the members of the mob that
cut the throat of William Donigan,
the aged negro, last Saturday night.
The negroes are leaving the city in
great numbers.
It is learned today that the aged
negro, Donnigan, who was lynched
opposite the capitol grounds by the
mob last Saturday, was the boot
maker for Abraham Lincoln. When
the president went to Washington,
Donnigan followed him there and
continued his services. fter the
assassinatio nt, he colored cobbler re
turned to Springfield and has been
there ever since. While in Washing-
ton he was employed by many other
famous men. Among them was
General Palmer, who later became
the presidential nominee of the Gold
Standard wing of democratic
party in 1906. the

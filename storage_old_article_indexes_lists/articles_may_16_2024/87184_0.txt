Hanging and Imprisoning Men
Hampton is Redeeming His Pledges to Hayes-.
Dispatch to Special
Cincinnati Gazette.
WASHINGTON, May 25.
A new and important fact in regard
to Wade Hampton's dealing with the
colored men tried for conspiracy at
Lowndesville, S. C., has lately become
known here. A colored man had been
bound over to keep the peace for violent
language" toward a white Democrat
. He became fearful of lynching
at the hands of other White Demo-
erats, and sent word to some of his
colored friends to keep watch about
the jail and prevent it. A number
gathered and secreted themselves at
night near the jail, and soon after
some white horsemen came along with
the negro from the jail dragged between
two of the horsemen by a rope
around his neck. Those thus hurrying
him off were a mob of lynchers, and
the undisguised purpose was to murto
der him. His friends attempted a rescue
, and in the melee one of the white
lynchers was killed. A crowd of eiti
zens turned out the next day, seoured
the country around and arrested
fifteen colored men.
The farce of a
trial was gone through with, and ten
of the number were convicted of conspiracy
to rescue the man taken from
the jail from the hands of the law.
This in the face of the fact that he was
taken from the hands of would be
murders by his friends, and friends to
whom he had appealed to prevent his
being taken from the jail where he was
in the hands of the law. Gov. Cham-
berlain, upon reviewing the case, pardoned
all the men, and gave his reason
at length for his action. This factis
not generally known at the North.
The rest of the story has been printed.
Hampton, immediately after his return
from Washington, with all his pledges
to the President to deal justly by the
colored people fresh on his lips, took
these and instead of facing
ap cases,
the anger of the cowardly lynchers
murderers, and recognizing the pardons
of Gov. Chamberlain, he executed
the sentences, and had three hung and
seven imprisoned for life Five of those

Rev. Joseph Silverman the leading
Jewish Rabbi of New York,
has thundered out against the recent
lynchings in Georgia in his latest
sermon, he says," what a sorry
spectacle our country thus presents
to the students of history and to
the world at large; here we have
been protesting against the barbarities
of the Spanish goverment,
und have carried on a war in the
aame of humanity and justice,
while within our own borders
such nameless torture and terrible
are permitted to hold
sway persecution."

LYNOHED NEAR MEMPHIS.
Nashville, Tenn.- A telegram from
Tupelo, Miss., fifty miles southeast of
Memphis, says: This morning at 2
o'clock a young negro about 18 years old,
was taken from the jail by a mob and
lynched in front of the court house.
The mob went to the sheriff's home,
overpowered him with shot- guns, marched
him to the jail, and forced the keys from
him.
They were masked and their identity is
unknown. The prisoner attempted to
rape a white lady at two
weeks ago. Plantersville

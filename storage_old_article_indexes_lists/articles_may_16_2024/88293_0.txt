William Chambers, a negro 23 years
of age, was hanged to a tree and his
body riddled with bullets, last Friday,
for an atrocious assault upon Lizzie
Watson, a pretty little girl 14 years
old. The girl, it is stated, was de-
irious and almost died from her in-
juries. The mob who hanged Cham-
bers cousisted of 500 men, unmasked
and very orderly.- William Wilson,
a negro accused of attempted criminal
assault, was spirited out of his cell in
the jail at Port Gibson, the same day,
and hanged on the county gallows.
No one observed the lynchers
a depart. enter

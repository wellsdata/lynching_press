Sheriff Shipp In Contempt
Way back in March, 1905, Ed John-
son, a negro who had been sentenced
to death by the state courts of Ten-
nessee for a nameless crime, was
taken out of the jail in Chattanooga
by a mob and hanged.
Before the
hanging took place an appeal from the
state courts to the United States supreme
court had been granted. This
operated as a supersedeas, and the offense
of Sheriff Shipp and one of nis
deputies in permitting the lynching of
the negro to take place was ons
against the court of last resort. It is
not claimed that he was present at the
lynching. The charge is that he was
not at the jail and did nothing to prevent
the lynching. The supreme court will
on June 1 mete out punishment to
Sheriff Shipp. his deputy and four residents
.
The supreme court holds that the
mob hung a man who was constructively
in its custody. As soon as the great
court granted an appeal to Johnson a
mob appeared at the jail and he was
taken out and hung. The chief court of
about its
country to assert
the is
dignity, and the Shipp case will doubtless
become one of the most historic
in the annals of the court.
There were doubts in the matter, it
is plain, for Justice Peckham presented
a dissenting opinion which was concurred
in by Justices White and Mc-
stood in other
Kenna. The court
words 6 to 3. The Associated Press
presents a summary of the opinion of
the court, written by the chief justice,
but it sent no summary of the dissenting
opinion of Justice Peckham. The
entire case is one of interest, and the
court, it is plain, stands ready to
compel respect its orders in all
parts of the union for.

LYNCHED BY A KANSAS MOB.
White Man in a Quarrel.
A Young Negro Strung Up for Stabbing a
KANSAS CITY, Mo., April 22.- At 9
o'clock Thursday night at Salina, Kan.,
a mob of 500 citizens lynched Dan
Adams, a young negro, for having assaulted
Agent Stout of the Union Pacific
freight office there with a razor.
The negro was found in the depot
by Stout early Thursday morning
and the agent ordered him out. The
negro refused to go and Stout started
for him with a shovel. Adams cut the
agent five times with a razor. The latter
wiH not die. At noon the district
court convicted the negro and sentenced
him to seven years in the penitentiary.
Sheriff Phillips had his man and was
on his way to the penitentiary with
him when overtaken by the mob. The
negro was under a seat in the coach.
The mob hauled him out and in ten
minutes had him under a telegraph
pole. The negro tried to say something
, but his utterances were drowned
by the yells of the mob. At 9 o'clock
he was hauled dressed only
up
in a shirt and trousers. In ten minutes
he was dead and the crowd dispersed.
There is great indignation at Salina
over the summary method used in the
case of Adams, but the mob contained
many so- called good citizens. The negro
was 20 years old and this was his first
serious
crime.

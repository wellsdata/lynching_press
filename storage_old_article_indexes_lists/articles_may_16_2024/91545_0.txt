GREAT BEND, Kans., June 13.- In
the public square, fronting on the principal
business street of this city, a
murderer was lynched at 8 o'clock this
evening by a mob of probably 500 persons
. It is estimated that at least 1000
of Great Bend's population of 2500 persons
witnessed the tragedy. The victim
was John Becker, a white man, 50
years of age, who, on April 8, killed
Myrtle Huffmeister, the 16- year- old
daughter of William Huffmeister, a
farmer living midway between Great
Bend and Ellinwood.
Becker was employed by the farmer
and professed passionate love for the
daughter. The tragedy followed the
girl's refusal to accept his advances.
When the girl came to the stable in the
evening Becker shot her to death, sending
eight bullets into her body, after
which he set fire to the farmer's
stables. At first it was reported the
murderer had shot himself and had died
in the flames, but later it became
known that he had fled and search was
instituted. On April 13 a posse of farmers
captured the murderer near St.
John, Stafford County, and for safe
keeping he was taken by the Sheriff to
Hutchinson, there having been many
threats that he would be lynched if
brought here.
This morning Becker was brought
from Hutchinson to be put upon his
preliminary examination. Early in the
day farmers from the neighborhood of
his crime began coming into town and
by 6 o'clock this evening the streets
were thronged. Then, when it became
known the murderer had been granted
a change of venue to Lyons and that
Sheriff Abeer would take nis prisoner
east on the Santa Fe train this evening
there were signs of threatened
trouble, as a big crowd began to gather
at the railroad depot. Sheriff Abeer,
appreciating the danger, took Becker
into a buggy and started for a crossing
east of the city, intending to flag
the train there. By this time the crowd
at the depot was openly threatening a
lynching.
When the train pulled in the purpose
of the Sheriff's strategy had become apparent
to all. The would- be lynchers,
quick to act, boarded the train and
rode on. When the Sheriff at the crossing
saw the train was crowded to the
guards he did not flag it, but hurriedly
drove back to Great Bend with his
prisoner. At Dartmouth the lynching
party left the train and started back
to this city, having hired all the conveyances
available there. Sheriff Abeer
had hurried back and lodged his prisoner
at the County Jail.
A few minutes before 8 o'clock the
mob was swarming round the jail. Evidently
believing that he could outwit
the lynchers by flight, the Sheriff
rushed Becker out of the jail to his
buggy, but he had no sooner done so
than he and his men and the prisoner
were surrounded. The Sheriff, aided by
his deputies, made a stubborn defense,
and the prisoner, realizing the fate that
threatened him, fought desperately
with them. After they had fought their
way back almost to the entrance to the
jail, the mob, through sheer force of
numbers, prevailed. Securing the murderer
, it bore him away to the public
square.
A rope was drawn around Becker's
neck, and after he had been beaten almost
to insensibility the rope was
thrown over a limb of a big tree and he
was drawn up. Some one in the crowd
gave the body a push, and as the murderer
was being drawn up, his body repeatedly
swung back, scraping upon the
trunk of the tree.
The Sheriff and his men kept close
upon the heels of the lynchers, but they
were held back for fully fifteen minutes
, when, it being apparent Becker
was dead, the mob quickly melted away
and the murderer's body was cut down
by the Sheriff and the Coroner.
Though revolvers were drawn and
threats were made, no shots were fired
by the Sheriff and his men in their
struggle against the lynchers. Many of
the lynching party must be known to
the county peace officers, but to- night
there is no very strong talk of arrests.
The sentiment here seems to be that if
ever a man deserved lynching
did. Becker
Becker is said to come of a prosperous
family at Marion, Ill. Attorney W.
W. Duncan was here from Marion to
defend him, and it is stated that insanity
was have been the murderer's defense

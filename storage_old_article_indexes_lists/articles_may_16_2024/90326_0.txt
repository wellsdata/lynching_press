RESULT OF RACE HATE.
Bishop Hood Says Politics Is at the
Bottom of Negro Lynchings.
New York, May 17.- At the Afro-
American M. E. conference today
Right Rev. J. W. Hood, D. D. LL. D.,
presiding bishop of the New York annual
conference, delivered the annual
address, taking as his subject," The
State of the Country." In the course
of his remarks, the bishop referred to
the recent lynchings in the south, saying
:
" I boldly assert that these outrages
' criginate in the deep seated race hate
in the communities where they occur.
If there are black men so beastly as
to be guilty of the horrid crime of
which they are often charged, that is
no excuse for the lynching, because in
any clear case against the black man
punishment is certain and swift by
legal process. There are no vexatious
delays in his case. I am entirely satisfied
that some negroes have been legally
put to death who were innocent
of crime. If the negro escapes he
must prove himself innocent beyond
the shadow of a doubt. I am entirely
satisfied that in some cases the crime
charged had no foundation in fact, but
was made up for the purpose of justifying
the race hate.
" A peculiar kind of politics is at
the bottom of nearly all these outrages
- politics which has for its purpose
the denial to the black man of
the civil and political rights
are enjoyed by others. In most whien cases
the pretense that there is any cher
cause for them is a sham, a deception,
fraud."

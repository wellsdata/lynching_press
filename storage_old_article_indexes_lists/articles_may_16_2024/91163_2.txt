Earle, Ark., June 21.- A mob composed
of prominent white citizens of
this city lynched Elton Mitchell
Thursday night, June 13. It is said
that his body was hacked into bits
with butcher knives before it was
strung up to a sycamore tree. The act
of cannibals was prompted by Mitch-

When officers arrived at the scene of
the crime they were told that Mitchell

they left the vicinity without further
investigation and did not attempt to
make an arrest, in spite of the fact
that several of the men who lynched
Mitchell were in the immediate

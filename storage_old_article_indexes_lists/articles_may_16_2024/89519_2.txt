Birmingham, July 28, -Mayor Lane tried
this morning& negro who was caught by
the police Friday night while hiding armed
, in company with several others of his
race near the city jail, with the intention
of resisting an anticipated attempt by white
men to take from jail the negro John Par-
ker, who shot the L.& N. brakeman,
Franklin, last week. The prisoner was
acquitted as the charge was rioting and the
evidence didn't sustain anything so serious.
There is still a strong feeling among
groes over Parker's supposed danger. ne-

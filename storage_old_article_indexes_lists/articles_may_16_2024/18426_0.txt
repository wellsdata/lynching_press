A negro lynching occurred in Akron,
last August, and the participants probably
thought they would escape legal
penalty but they were doomed to disappointment
. Twenty- two of them
have been sentenced to imprisonment for
terms ranging from thirty days to five
years and fourteen more are likely to re-
ceive similar punishment. This will be
likely to have a salutary effect upou
who think its fine thing to be
people a
long to a murderous mob. Enforce-
of law is a good thing for law and
ment order.

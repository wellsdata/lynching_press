When Joseph Libenyi, his would- be assassin, in 1853, wounded the Emperor
seriously by a knife thrust between the shoulders, the wounded monarch
the wretch:
" Do
the mob that was on the point of lynching
not cried hurt out him to; he has been badly mauled already!" It was his aid- de- camp,
Count O'Donnell, who saved Francis Joseph from death on that occasion.
One day, driving to his castle of Schoenbrunn the Emperor found a fire-
engine, which had been on the way to a big conflagration, stuck in the mire
of the road. He instantly caused his carriage horses to be unharnessed in
order help pull the engine out of the mud, while he himself hailed a passing
hack to to take him to his destination.

Another Kentucky Negro Lynched.
Springfield, Ky., Aug. 26.- At 2 o'clock
this morning a mob of about a dozen men
took Harrison Lewis, a negro who murdered
Joe Brooks, also colored, Friday
night, from jail and hanged him to a tree
in the courthouse yard. The mob procured
sledge hammers, and after three
hours' work succeeded in battering down
the jail door. Lewis begged piteously for
life, but with a rope around his neck he
was dragged to the nearest tree and
strung up. It is the opinion of many that
the mob was composed of colored men. On
Friday night Lewis went to Brooks' house
and, calling him to the door, shot him
down on his own threshold without warning
. Lewis was a brother of Matthew
Lewis, who narrowly escaped lynching here
two weeks ago for an assault upon Mrs.
Murray Shields, and was taken to
ville for safe keeping. Louis-

FAIL TO UNCOVER
IDENTITY OF MOB
( By United Press)
Santa Rosa, Calif., Dec. 11.- The
action of the coroner's jury in naming
unknown persons as responsible for
the triple lynching here Friday morning
, has placed great obstacles in the
way of prosecution, according to the
state's attorney. County and
officers are seeking every evidence district
which could be used in prosecution, but
have so far failed to identify any of
the supposedly large mob which lynched
the three San Francisco gangsters.
Throngs of curious packed the cemetery
three blocks beyond the city limits
where the gangsters were hanged.
Souvenirs were sought and all manner
of pieces of wood and stone were
carried away.

Heber Springs Jacksonian- Headlight,
is in Conway today on his return from
Fort Smith, where he attended the
State Baptist Convention. Mr. Brawn

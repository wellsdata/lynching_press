Abettors of Crime.
Upon such men, wherever or whoever
they may be, there rests a tremendous
responsibility as aiders and
abettors of the criminal class of ne-
groes and of arousing among the less
intelligent negroes a bitter race hatred
.
No one is more bitterly opposed to
mob law than the Manufacturers
Record. They who lynch a criminal
lynch the law and the sovereignty of
the state, and whenever lynching for
one crime is not punished it inevitably
begets a diregard of law which
in lynchings and
finds expression
murderings for other causes. But
the public
primarily the paper or
man who justly denounces lynchings
for an outrage upon womanhood
without at the same time denouncing
with all possible energy the crime
itself, to the extent that would be
done if his own wife or daughter had
thus suffered, is particeps criminis
in developing other crimes by falsely
leading the negro race to think lightly
of this fearful crime which brutish
commit against white wom-
negroes en.

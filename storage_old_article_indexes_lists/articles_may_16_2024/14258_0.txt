THE DEED OF A DESPERADO.

Kills two Party
Lynchers, Escapes and is
Recaptured.
Panther, W. Va., June 29.- The attempt
of a mob to lynch a negro, yesterday
, at Jager, five miles south of
here, resulted in the killing of two of
the would- be lynchers. The negro,
Peter Price, was accused of insulin
a white woman. He was pursued by
a crowd of men, and sought refuge
in a small room in the rear of a saloon
. The mob battered down the
door, and as they entered the room
Price threw himself at them with
the ferocity of a tiger, with a knife
in each hand. In cutting his way out
he killed George Hooks and F. M. Mc-
Gran and seriously cut Charles Davis.
As Price struck down these men the
others fell back, and the negro made
his escape through an open window.
Several members of the mob
brought revolvers into play, but they
succeeded in inflicting only two slight
flesh wounds. Price was pursued and
captured by officers, who hurriedly
sent him to the jail at Welch to avoid
the vengeance of the enraged populace
. and McGran were both
well- known Hooks citizens.

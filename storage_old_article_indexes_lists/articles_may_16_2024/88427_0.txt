A Curd From Judge Sprott
To the Editor of The Age- Herald.
As numerous exaggerated reports of
the Bud Beard trial at Carrollton have
been spread, in justice to the citizens of
Pickens county, I would say that the
trial was not held under the protection
of troops, but that they arrived twelve
hours after the trial was concluded. The
" mob" which was to lynch Beard did
not consist of more than fifty men. The
sentiment of the good people of Pickens
county was in favor of letting the law
take its course. Mr. Crocker, the father
of the outraged girl, when told that some
desired to lynch the negro, said:" No,
let him have a fair and impartial trial."

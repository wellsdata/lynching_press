dent Nothing More Nor
Less as Than Lynching
himself realizes that so far as legal
assistance will go he will get little or
no aid from me. Thus far I do not
think he needs any. But the ridiculousness
of the situation is again apparent
when one considers the sena-
tor from the north, who, by reason of
his radical and aggressive utterances
and probably his actions in the past,
once gave him the name of" Fire
Alarm.' The senator finds himself
aligned with that senator from the
south( Tillman, himself), who is usually
supposed to have broiled negro
for breakfast; who is known to justify
lynching for rape, and whose attitude,
if not that of hatred to the negro, is a
feeling akin to it, in the belief that
white men are made of better clay,
that white men alone are entitled to
participate in government, and so
this alliance is the an odd one."

RAVISHED AND MURDERED.
Horrible
Deed of an Ohio Farm
Hand.
ALLIANCE, O, Nov. 15- Last night
Birdie Baugh, a hadsome and highly
respected young lady student at Mount
Union college, was ravished and murdered
by Curt Davidson a farm hand
employed by her father, in the absence
of her parents. This morning the dead
body was found on the barn floor.
Davidson was found half a mile away
with his throat cut by him self and still
alive.
Though Davidson may recover there
,
is talk of lynching him if he does. The
people of the town are wrought to a
frenzy over the horrible deed.
There is imminent danger that David-
sen will be lynched tonight. The murderer
is reported to be so near death as
not to be worth hanging, but there is a
growing conviction among the lynching
party that he is not dying and that the
physicians are giving out these reports
to pacify the people.
Assemblages of men throughout the
city convinced the authorities that the
murderer was in danger of lynching before
morning and Sheriff Kreiber came
down from Canton at ten o'clock. The
guard on Davidson was reinforced but
in less than an hour the situation became
so threatening that company K.
eighth regiment O. N. G. was ordered
out. It is now stationed at the barracks
under arms. The men who are
eager to finish Davidson are not awed
by the demonstration.
The prisoner was removed to the
rail way station in an ambulance under
a guard and taken to New Lisbon. At
the depot the mob made a desperate
attempt to secure him, but were repulsed
after a skirmish with
guards. the

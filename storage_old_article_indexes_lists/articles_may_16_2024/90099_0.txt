COLORED PRISONER
PROMISED A FAIR
TRIAL IN GEORGIA
Sylvester, Ga., Feb. 17.- A resolution
addressed to Governor McCray
of Indiana pledging every protection
and impartial trial for Mace Giddens,
held in Indiana for murder of a
deputy sheriff of this country, was
adopted here by a citizens' mass
meeting.
Governor McCray had sent a representative
, W. A. Guthrie, to the county
to investigate conditions before
acting on an extradition application
in the case. Guthrie was given a
copy of the resolution to carry back
to the governor.
Attorneys for Giddens in Indiana
opposed extradition on the plea that
he would be in danger of lynch law
if sent back. The citizens of Georgia
are anxious to have Giddens
returned
, but it is said the opinion in
Indiana is that even if the colored
man is given a trial it will be
tically a legal lynching. prac-

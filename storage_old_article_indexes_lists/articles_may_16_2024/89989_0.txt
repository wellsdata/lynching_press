their own inclinations. It matters not
a whit that the victim of the
lynching guilty and de-
was
served all he got. Every reasonable
probability led to the conclusion that the
courts would do according to law all that
any mob would do in defiance of law. In
that state of things a mob to execute extralegal
or illegal justice is simply an abomination
to the moral sense of every intelligent
and right- feeling man. But just such cases
have occurred in many States under the
same general conditions, and have escaped
with as complete immunity as if their action
had been that of an honest, law- abiding
body. We can not now recall a single instance
of the legal punishment of mobs that
have inflicted illegal punishment on offenders
. Indiana has had a score of lynching
mobs in the last five years, but if a man of
all the hundreds concerned has ever been
called to account by law for it we can't remember
it. We can't recall a case even of
an indictment of mob murder. But South
Carolina, whatever may be said of some features
of her social or political condition.
puts the heavy hand of law on illegal combinations
to punish crime without law. It
is well done, and she deserves all honor for
leading the way in one of the most important
reforms of the social condition of
country. this

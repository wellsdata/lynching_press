As a result, it was expected late

The FBI is handicapped.
What the local
authorities did
not do, and what they did do, be-
fore the GBI and FBI were called

Failure to use any Negro investi-
gators.
Unwillingness, based on fear, of
anybody and everybody, white and
Negru, to tell what he knows or
has good reason to suspect.

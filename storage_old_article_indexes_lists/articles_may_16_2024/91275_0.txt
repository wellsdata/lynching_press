Mardering Negroes.
There are many points of resemblance
between the Northern Copperheads and
the Southern rebels. The rebels murdered
negroes in cold blood at Harpeth
Shoals, at Murfreesboro', and at Mar-
tinsville. The New York World asserts
that the rebels have a right to do this,
and the telegraphic account of the Copperhead
riot in resisting the draft in New
York city says:
Fiendish outrages of the worst kind
were also practiced on the blacks, their
furniture broken, and negro women, looking
after their property, were driven off
by the mob, having to run a fearful gauntlet
.
One negro house in Columbia street
was destroyed, and a few small houses
in Pillory street were pillaged. The Le-
groes were horribly maltreated.
Last night the mob on Staten Island
sacked the Lyceum and attacked the
Marine Hospital, taking off about 500
muskets with ammunition. The same
mob hung a negro there.
The Copperheads are animated by the
D
Isame flendish hatred of the negro that
the Southern rebel feels. It is the
of the brute against a helpless inferior rage.

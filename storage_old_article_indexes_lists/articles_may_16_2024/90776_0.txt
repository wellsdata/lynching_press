PUNISH MURDERERS.
SOUTH CAROLINA TO
New York, -Gov. Richard
I. Manning of South Carolina
as a result of the recent lynching
of Anthony Crawford, at
Abbeville, has taken a stand
which promises to clear the
the name of the State of the
stigma which attached to it
during the administration of
his predecessor, the notorious
Cole Blease Governor Manning
, in a statement given out
to the press on the day before
election, said:
" I was out of the State when
the Abbeville lynching occurred
. As soon as I learned
cit called Solicitor R. A.
Cooper and Sheriff R. M.
Burts of Abbeville to the office
and called on Coroner F.
W. R. Nance of Abbeville
County to comply with the
law and furnish me with a
copy of the testimony taken
at At the coroner's inquest. I
found that the coroner held
an inquest, but took no testi-
mony." He had instructed
the Sheriff and Prosecutor to
find and arrest all guilty of
murdering Crawford.
The lynching referred to
occured on October 21 in one
of South Carolina's most
beautiful and progressive cit.
ies. Anthony Crawford, the
victim, was 51 years old and
worth over$ 20,000. He got
into a row with a white store
keeper named Barksdale over
the price of cottonseed. It is
reported that Mr. Barksdale
called him a liar and Craw-
ford cursed him roundly in
return, whereupon a clerk ran
out to give Crawford a beating
with an ax handle. He
was saved from this by a policeman
, who arrested Crawer
ford and took him to the
municipal building, but when
they let him out on bail a
crowd of men took after him
again, intent on punishing
him for daring to curse a
white man.
" The day a white man hits
me is the day I die." Anthony
Crawford once said to a friend
When he saw the crowd coming
after him he went down
in the boiler room of a gin,
picked up a four- pound hammer
and waited. The first
man who came at him, Mc-
Kinney Cann, received a bad
but not fatal blow in the head
which fractured his skull, but
someone hurled a stone which
knocked out Crawford before
he reached any one else.
The mob went back to the
jail at 4 o'clock that afternoon
dragged Crawford thru the
streets of the colored quarter
with a rope around his neck,
hung his mutilated body to a
pine tree at the entrance to
the fair grounds. and expended
a couple of hundred rounds
of ammunition at it.
On Monday a meeting was
called in the Abbeville court
house, at it was decided
to order the which sixteen sons and
daughters of Crawford and
their families to abandon
their$ 20,0co home and get
out of the State by November
15. After the meeting this
mob proceeded to close up all
the colored shops in Abbeville
The Columbia State, in a
powerful editorial, pointed
out that in view of the exodus
of colored labor from the
south to the northern industrial
fields and the appoach of
the new boll weevil, South
Carolina's problem was to
keep her colored men instead
of serving notice on them, no
matter how industrious or
successful they might be
their case was absolutely
hopeless. It so convinced
the business men of Abbeville
that they had lynched their
own pocketbooks that on No
vember 6 another mass meeting
was held in the courthouse
denouncing the mob's out-
rage, pledging law and order
in the county, invoking state
and federal aid if necessary,
and planning a local military
company and guaranteeing
protection to all.
Governor Manning has personally
endorsed all this and
will seek to have the legislature
act against lynch law
the future. in

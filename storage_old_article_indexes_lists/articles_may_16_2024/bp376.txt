semi-annual
worded Tuskegee
report on lynchings
reveals that mob violence in the
lynching category is definitely on the
decline. The Tuskegee report is
based "on news releases and on in-
vestigations made by persons living
in various areas."
The NAACP, which also keeps a
check on lynchings, differs with
Tuskegee. The former lists four
lynchings, according to its method.
of classification. Three of the vic-
tims were white, and were flogged
to death in Georgia. The other, a

unknown persons at Brownsville,

Tenn., on June 22d, "for attempting
to exercise his constitutional right to
register and vote."
The question here has to do with
the size and nature of mobs and the
technique they employ in disposing
of their victims. The Georgia flog-

with the Ku Klux Klan, and there
were some prosecutions. It was
pretty well established that the flog-
gings were committed by groups of
people. The question is: did these
groups constitute mobs? The
NAACP thinks they did.

The Tennessee case was quite
different in nearly all its aspects
from the Georgia case. Here was
a situation in which a question of
civil rights was involved and there
was general knowledge on the part
of the mayor of Brownsville and
other responsible white people in the
community that certain colored men
had been threatened with harm if
they insisted upon the exercise of
certain civil rights. The mayor had
been appealed to, according to re-
ports, and had told colored citizens
that the situation was beyond his
control. Groups of whites had in-
timidated colored individuals. and
groups. In the end, one colored man
was the victim of a gang murder.
according to the evidence. Was this
gang murder a lynching? When all
the circumstances
considered
are
the difference is only one of tech-
nique. The victim was not strung
up openly in the way that mobs used
to operate.
So, we hold that Tuskegee is
wrong on the Brownsville case and
that the NAACP is right. On the
Georgia cases, and many other
cases where the victims of gang or
group wrath just disappear and are
found dead, it is hard to distinguish
between gang murder and mob mur-
der unless public opinion and legal
authorities are going to agree that
they are one and the same.

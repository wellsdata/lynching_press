MURDER AND LYNCH LAW
According to the Chicago Tribune,
the number of deaths by personal
violence of all kinds in 1911, as reported
by telegraph and recorded in
the papers in every state in the
union, was 8272. as compared with
8975 in 1910. It must be taken into
account that this record is not confined
to such cases of murder and
homicide as result in arrest and conviction
, but includes deaths by every
form of violence.
To thousands of murders there
were only 74 legal executions in the
United States during the year 1911.
as compared with 104 in 1910, 107
in 1909 and 92 in 1908. Classified by
states, the record is as follows: Ari-
zona 1, Alabama 4. Arkansas 4. Cal-
ifornia 1. Delaware 1. Florida 1,
Georgia 12. Illinois Kentucky 4,
1.
Louisiana 2, Mississippi 4. New York
14, New Jersey 4. North Carolina 4.
Nebraska 1. Ohio 3. Oklahoma 1.
Pennsylvania 3, South Carolina 3.
Tennessee 3, Virginia 2 and West
Virginia 1.
Necessarily. such tenderness to
murderers has created and maintains
as a regular institution the tribunal
of Judge Lynch, or popular justice,
something unknown outside of our
great and free republic. The number
of lynchings in 1911 was seventy- one,
the smallest number recorded since
1885, when there were 184 such ex-
ecutions. The largest number in the
twenty- seven years included was
1892, when the lynchings numbered
255, and in 1893 they were 200.
The distribution
of the lynchings
of 1911 to the several states was as
follows: Alabama 3. Arkansas 4.
Florida 7, Georgia 19, Idaho 1, Ken-
tucky 8, Louisiana 4. Maryland 1,
Mississippi 2, Missouri 2. Nebraska
1. Ohio 1, Oklahoma 6. Pennsylvania 1,
South Carolina 1, Tennessee 6.
6. Texas 4. Of the total number,
seven were whites and sixty- four
blacks, among the latter one woman.
The United States must be accu-
mulating a large population of acquitted
and pardoned murderers. It
is a question whether or not they
could be rejected for that cause
when summoned
on a jury in
a
murder case in a state where capi-
tal punishment is possible unless an
unwillingness to inflict it were specially
confessed. Otherwise such
a
could
talesman rejected
not be for
cause.
But the legal executions and the
lynchings taken together make but a
pitiful showing of our national indifference
murderous crimes.-

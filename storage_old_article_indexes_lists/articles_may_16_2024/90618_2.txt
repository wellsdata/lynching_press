After the convicts had taken Mr.
Cowan's money and his revolver they
removed their leg irons and made
their way to the Mississippi River,
where they crossed into Coahoma
County, Miss. The spot where they
were working was near Oldtown and
almost directly opposite Friar Point,
which has recently been the
of a brutal lynching. scene

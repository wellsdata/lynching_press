Elmore's Grand Jury.
The chicken squabble in Elmore
County, in which no man was hurt,
and no woman even concerned, may
become historic in the history of the
State. The negro in the case was
lynched by thirty white people, and
the best people of the county are endeavoring
to redeem its fair name
from the disgrace that the mob cast
upon it.
We have no desire to prejudge the
cases. Few indictments have already
been found, and more may follow.
The grand jury should sift the matter
to the bottom, and if the solicitor of
the circuit does his duty a lesson may
be taught that will be more beneficial
to the county and State than ten
on crops. cot-

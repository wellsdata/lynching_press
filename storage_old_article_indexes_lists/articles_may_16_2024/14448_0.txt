THE murder of editor Dawson, of Charles-
ton, S. C., by a libertine with whom he remonstrated
for his crimes, has caused great
excitement in that city. We cannot, under
any circumstances, uphold or apologize for
the law of violence, and yet it is true that
the moral sense of the country would have
sustained the people of Charleston had
they carried out their impulse to lynch the
murderer. These
outbursts of popular
feeling are not nearly so bad indications as
they appear- the form they take in action
in defiance and usurpation of the law, is
never defensible, but in reality attempts to
speedily execute such murderers as Mc-
Dow are not aimed against the law, and are
manifestations of manly spirit, of sympathetic
instincts, and of the horror communities
experience in the presence of awful
crimes. It is to the credit of the city of
Charlston that the mob did not have time to
crystallize its purpose into activity, and that
the officials were able to protect the wretch
from the anger of the multitude. Never-
th- less- we repeat- it is certain that had
the man been lynched there would have
been throughout the land more of sym-
pathy than of condemation for the lynchers
If, however, there was that certainty
about the administration of our criminal
laws that there should be, there would be
greatly less of the feeling entertained that
* popular tribunals" are sometimes justifiable
. It is knowledge of the fact that the
law's delays and the technicalties
of practice
and procedure afford the guilty undue
opportunities to escape, that disposes the
people when great crimes are committed to
resort to violent methods to avenge them.
Lynch law and resistance
of authority will
become unknown when the laws are so reformed
that criminals will be tried speedily
and their punishment can be soon applied.
The repose of entire confidence in the law
by the people, that it is the most certain,
direct and briefest means to the accomplishment
of justice will become the rule
when it is deserved; and when it is, that
hour will mark the birth of the era
which mob law will be unknown. in

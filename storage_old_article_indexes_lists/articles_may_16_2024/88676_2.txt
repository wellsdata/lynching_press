From the Pittsburg
Sheriff North has shown again that the

praised throughout the country.
Sheriff North the same degree of praise
is due.- Albany Evening Journal.
If a few more Southern sheriffs should
imitate the example of Sheriff North at
Ashville, Ala., and should put bullets
into a mob of woud- be lynchers, the
sport would grow less common in the
South Most of these lynching parties
seem. to be made up of thugs and crimi
nals who go into the lynching- bee for
the fun of the thing. Horse racing is
expensive, while the total cost of a lynching

for the crowd, and a few sticks of fire
wood with which to burn the victim.
Boston Evening Record.
Laws against lynchings will never
prove effective until the law officers understand
that their enforcement must be
compelled even if life is lost in the at
tempt. When sheriffs generally learn to
follow the example of this Alabama officer

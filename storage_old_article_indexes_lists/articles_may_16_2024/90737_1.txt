Spoiling for a Fight.
PORTLAND, ORE., September 10.- Since
the lynching of the Indian at Cheney, in
Washington Territory, for brutally out

innocent of the heinous offense.

with war- paint, and serious trouble is
feared. The lynched Indian belonged to
the Umatillas, which tribe has long hated
the whites and been anxious to
provocation for a fight. have

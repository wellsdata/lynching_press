On Sunday morning twenty masked
men went and demanded the keys
of the jailer in Burlington, the coun-
Boone county, Ky. The
ty seat of
jailer refused, whereupon they broke
open the jail, took Charles Dicker-
sou, a negro who was arrested last
March for burglary and escape, but
was again arrested a week ago in the
act of barglary. The mob took him
two from Burlington and
ynched miles him.

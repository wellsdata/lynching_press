Governor Thwarts a Mob.
Atlanta, Ga., Aug. 6. It became
known to- day that Governor Candler
of this state made a personal trip to
Newman, a town sixty miles south of
this city, yesterday morning, to save
the life of the negro rapist, John Mul-
lins, charged with an assault upon
Mrs. Cook, Wednesday.
Governor Candler left the legislative
mansion at 4 a. m. and arrived at the
jail of Coweta county an hour after
daybreak. He took command of the
Newman guards, a
company of the
state militia which had been guarding
the jail during the night from a mob,
and directed Sheriff Brown to take his
prisoner at once to Atlanta for safe
keeping. The greatest excitement pre-
valled in the town during the night
and Sheriff Brown, fearing an attack
from the mob, telephoned Governor
Candler several times for instructions,
The mob was successfully
and the prisoner lodged in jail avoided here.

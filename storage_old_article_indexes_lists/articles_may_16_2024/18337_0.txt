Macon, Ga .. Aug. 2.- An extra
heavy guard was ready to be
here
thrown around the Bibb county jail
to protect three negroes held in connection
with the murder several
months ago of A. L. Aligood, a street
car conductor. The guard was assembled
early today when the police
received word that several hundred
persons had assembled at the Central
city park and were planning an t
tack on the county jail. Later te-
ports said that the crowd had
persed. dis
The precautionary steps followed a
day of excitement at Macon yester
day and uneasiness on the part of
the authorities who expressed fears
of a serious race clash growing out
of the lynching at Holton, near here,
of John Glover, a negro, charged
with the murder here Saturday night
of Deputy Sheriff Walter C. Byrd.
Glover was taken from an Atlanta
train at Griffin yesterday and shot
death. ISC1 to

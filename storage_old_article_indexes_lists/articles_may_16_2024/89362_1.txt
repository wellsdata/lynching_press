Harmon Will Take Action
Columbus, O., July 10 .-" I will take action
in the morning," said Governor Har-
mon tonight after his return from New
ark.
He refused to say what the action would
be, but the governor left the inference
upon his hearers that Mr. Atherton would
be suspended Monday on charges to be
filed by the governor under section 226
of the general code, which provides for
guspension of mayors by the governor
for 30 days, during which time they shall
have the right to make their defense
against the charges.
If a defense is not made within that
time, according to the code, or if the
charges are sustained, the suspension is
then determined. The governor can take
no action of his own initiative against
Sheriff Linke. He must wait for the
filing of charges against him by five citizens
of Licking county before he can act
himself. When these petitions are filed,
as the governor, he may, proceed in the
manner as established under preon-
same dent.

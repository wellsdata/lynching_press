OHIO MOB TRIES
TO LYNCH NEGRO
Night of Violence Result of
Attempted Assault on
Farmer's Wife- Prisoner
Spirited Away.
Lima, Ohio, August 31.- After a
night of violence resulting from the
attempt of a mob to lynch Charles
Daniels, the negro accused of assaulting
Mrs. John Baber, wife of a farmer,
the spiriting away of the prisoner by
Sheriff Sherman Eley, and the torture
of the sheriff until he consented
to lead the mob in motors to Ottawa,
where he had taken the man, the law
apparently reigned again today. Dan
iels, the prisoners whose life was
saved by the quick action of the sheriff
, is in a safe place, Toledo it is
understood, and P. J. Lasser, prosecutor
of Allen county is taking the
preliminary steps of investigation into
the affair.
Governor Willis was prepared to
day to order two regiments of national
guard from Camp Perry to this
city in case the trouble is revived.
After the unsuccessful pursuit of
Daniels in a motor procession to Ot
tawa last night, members of the mob
had dispersed, it is believed.
Sheriff Eley escaped from the mob
at Ottawa and is under the care of a
physician. He is suffering, it is understood
, from two broken ribs and
minor injuries from his
handling numerous by the mob.
FORESIGHT SAVES NEGRO
Eley's foresight is believed to have
saved his prisoner's life. Eley expected
trouble and quietly removed
the prisoner to Ottawa. He
was
later transferred to another place.
While the sheriff was out of the city
the mob stormed the jail, forced the
sheriff's wife to open the cells. Sheriff
Eley returned last night and the
mob demanded that he tell where he
had hidden
Daniels. He escaped
from his home at the jail as the mob
battered down the doors, but was captured
at the Elks' home. A rope was
torn from a street trolley and was
passed around Eley's neck. He was
told he would be hanged if he did not
tell where his prisoner was and the
mob tore his clothing from his body
and kicked and beat him. Eley fin
ally surrendered to escape death and
the mob entered automobiles and
started for Ottawa, taking Eley with
them.
When the mob reached Ottawa they
found their prisoner gone and during
the confusion, Sheriff Eley es
caped into a hotel and evaded second
capture

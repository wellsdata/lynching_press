A Lynching Predicted.
CHICAGO, August 28.- A private letter
from A. D. Bond, near Taylorville, says his
daughter Emma, so brutally outraged sev-
Ieral weeks ago, cannot live, unforseen complications
having arisen. Her death will
be the signal for the immediate lynching
of Montgomery, Pettis and Clements, who
so narrowly escaped just after the trial.
There is militia enough in the State to
prevent the not lynching.

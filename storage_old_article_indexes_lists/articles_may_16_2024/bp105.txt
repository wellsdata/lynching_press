It quickly soured when laws be-
gan to be passed that disenfran-
chised Black Americans.
In episode two, "Fighting
Back," from 1896 to 1917, a
strong Black class emerges to
battle for political and econom-
ic changes.
Episode three, "Don't Shout
Too Soon," examines the period
between 1918 to 1940, a time
between the World Wars of in-
creased violence and lynching
activity. The final episode is
"Terror and Triumph," the pe-
riod from 1940 to 1954, in
which soldiers returning from
war in Europe agitated for
equal treatment at home.
The Jim Crow laws were hor-
rible. Blacks couldn't vote, had
separate public facilities and
were treated like second-class
citizens. In the North, there
was housing discrimination
and employment disparity. In
the South, it was sometimes
more brutal and oppressive.
Nevertheless, folks bravely
fought the status quo.
One of those Southerners was
Ned Cobb, a sharecropper. Cobb
bucked the system and man-
aged to purchase his own farm.
He lived in Tallapoosa, Ala.,
and became a supporter of the
Communist Party. With the
Communist Party support,
Cobb formed a 6,000 strong
tenant farmers union in 1930s
Alabama.

the series.
"We didn't know what we
were getting into," he said.
"We just happened to be in the
right place, at the right time to
make a difference."
What the series does well is
to record the voices of those
who lived through the experi-
ence. That's important be-
cause many of eyewitnesses
are elderly and their historical
commentary is captured while
they can still give it.
In addition, rare and some-
times never-before-seen pho-
tos and film footage make the
series a dynamic and poignant
record of a time when indig-
nity and terror constantly
faced off against courage and
accomplishment.
A revelation for some and a
reminder for others is the vast
extent to which African-Ameri-
cans surpassed survival and
victimization to create remark-
able faith-filled communities.
To share these tales, the docu-
mentary is broken down into
four distinct chapters, accord-
ing to Richard Wormser, the
producer, writer and director of
the series. "Promises Be-
trayed," part one, covers the pe-
riod from 1865 to 1896, when
newly freed slaves and Recon-

Barbara Johns eventually
moved to Philadelphia, mar-
ried a minister and became a
school librarian. She died of
cancer in 1991, but is remem-
bered in the documentary for
making a difference.
"We didn't think of ourselves
as heroes," said John Watson,

tary that explores segregation

produced by Thirteen/WNET,
PBS' New York affiliate-is an

The series is compelling.
The people, unforgettable.
Among those highlighted:

year-old who lived in segregat-

community in rural Virginia.
In 1951 Farmville, Blacks

Black high school was too
small to accommodate a stu-

the situation, the all-white

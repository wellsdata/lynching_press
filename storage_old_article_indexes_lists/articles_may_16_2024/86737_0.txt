On perusing M. Belly's views on Central
American politics and Yankee filibustering tendencies
, one does not know which to admire
most, the ignorance and coolness of his assumptions
in regard to the political course of our
government, or the boldness with which he ventures
bis dapper little person amongst us after
the hard names and bitter vituperation which
he lavishes on us as a people. Surely, M.
Belly, you cannot think us euch a nation of
barbarians, or you would not run the risk of
the reprisals with which such courtesies are
usually visited by" savages." You are right in
trusting to our" imperfect civilization," such
as it is. We shall neither mob you, lynch you
Lor tar and feather you. You have probably
found out by this time that even savages exercise
the virtues of hospitality, and that we pos
sees some other qualities which you forgot in
the enumeration of our characteristics. Learn
a little common sense, good M. Belly, and take
care to make yourself acquainted with a
jeot before you either talk or write about it sub.

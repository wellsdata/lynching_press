How the bosses instigate and
carry out the lynching of Negro
workers, how capitalist courts and
police co- operate in delivering the
victims over to the lynching mobs or
in railroading them through to a
legal lynching, when that seems
most feasible, is sharply exposed in
the latest developments in connection
with two of Georgia's ten lynchings
for the past nine months.
ing for Grant Killed in Cell
In the case of George Grant, one
of the victims of the double lynching
at Darien, Ga., on September 8,
spectacular developments have occurred
as a result of the militia and
sheriff trying to pass the buck to
each other. Forced to admit that
there was no mob involved in the
lynching of Grant as war reported
by the bosses' news agencies, Colonel
Neal, the commander of the
militia detachment which was on
guard at the time, supposedly to
prevent a lynching, declares
was killed in his cell. He further Grant
declares that he had guards in the
yard of the prison and that no one
could have entered the cell except
through the sheriff's office.
The sheriff retorts that he" does
not know who did it, and does not
give a damn," and adds further that
" if you want to know, ask the
Savannah National Guard officers
who were down here."
One Victim Wrongly Accused.
Out of this passing of the buck,
two facts develop: 1) that there was
no mob involved in the lynching of
Grant and 2) that the capitalist
press deliberately created a mob in
order to cover up the additional fact
that the capitalist state officials not
only hand over Negro workers to the
mobs but themselves participate in
he bloody lynching terror of the
bosses against the Negro masses.
Grant, with another Negro worker,
Willie Bryan, was accused or returning
the fire of police when the lat-
t√©r opened up on them without
ing" because they looked like suspi warn-
cious characters and were approaching
a bank." Grant was lynched in
his cell. Bryan was lynched by a
posse, police later admitting that
Byan had had no part in the fight.
More Startling Developments
In the case of the lynching of
John Willie Clark Saturday before
last in Cartersville, Ga., there are
even more startling developments.
The lynching of Clark was one of
three staged in Georgia within the
five days of September 25 to Sep-
tember 30, a period when the bosses
of the entire South were busy in-
tensifying their lynching terror in
order to create a lynching atmosphere
for the trial of the six Atlanta
" insurrection" defendants whose
trial, set for September 30, was postponed
as a result of a sharp fight
on the part of the International Labor
Defense.
Delivered to Lynchers
Clark was lynched for defending
himself against a drunken Chief

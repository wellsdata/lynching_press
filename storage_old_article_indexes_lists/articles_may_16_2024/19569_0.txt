IN MARYLAND,
Frightful Scene as the Mob Did Its
-
VICTIM SAID HE WAS DRUNK
When the Crime Was Committed, and
He Did Not Remember It- Assaulted
a Wotaan.
[ Afternoon Dispatches.]
Belair, Md., March 27 -- Lewis Harris,
the negro who was arrested here Sun
day charged with a criminal assault
upon Miss Anne Melivain, was taken
from the jail last night and lynched by
a mob of twenty m√®n.
A fusilade of shots was exchanged
between the sheriff and deputies and the
mob, resulting in the wounding of Rob
ert L. Bull and one of the crowd, whose
name was not learned. Neither was
badly hurt.
The jail door was finally forced and
Harris was taken out. While in the
hands of the mob he exclaimed:" If I
did it, men, I was drunk and did not
know what I was about. I have no
recollection of it."
The mob hustled him to a neighboring
door yard and placing a noose
around his neck flung the other end of
the rope over a limb of e tree. As he
was hoisted from the ground the limb
snapped and Harris fell to the ground.
He was lifted up again moaning, and
hanged a second time. Several shots
were fired into the body, the loose end
of the rope was tied to a gate post and
the corpse left hanging until this morning
.
Miss Mellvain, Harris victim, is
about 54 years of age. She lives alone
near the railway station. She was
called to her door at midnight Saturday
and attacked by a negro whom she afterwards
identified as Harris. The indignation
aroused by the crime was
more intense because of the fact that
it is the second of the kind within a
month, William Black, a negro, being
now confined in the Baltimore jail,
awaiting trial for assault upon Miss
Jessie Bradford of Aberdeen, from
which place last night's mob is said to
have come.
It is asserted that Miss Mellvain,
Harris' victim, was with the mob when
the jail was attacked last night, but
this cannot be confirmed, and it is certain
that she was not present at
actual hanging. the

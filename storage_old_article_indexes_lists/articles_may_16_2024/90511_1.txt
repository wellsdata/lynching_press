POSSE KILLS FIVE NEGROES.
Party of the Latter Resisted Arrest
and Eezan Firing.
Sheriff Fisher and a posse of thirteen
men made a raid on a crowd of negro
gamblers at Bayboro, thirteen miles east
of Moultrie, Ga., the other night. There
were seventy- five or 100 negroes in the
house, and as Sheriff Fisher walked in
some of the negroes began shooting, one
ball hitting the sheriff in the hand, inflicting
a painful wound. Two others of the
posse were hit. The posse returned a vigorous
fire, and as a result five negroes
were killed outright, three others mortally
wounded and three more painfully but
not fatally hurt. The negroes made a
determined resistance and 200 or 300
shots were fired.,

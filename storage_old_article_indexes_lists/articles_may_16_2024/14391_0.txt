LYNCH BLACK MURDERER
NEGROES AND WHITE MEN
Shreveport, November 2.- Joseph Crad-|
dock, a negro, was lynched by an infuriated
mob composed chiefly of blacks, at
Taylortown, in Bossier parish, about seventeen
miles from Shreveport last night.
Craddock's crime
was a particularly
atrocious one. He secured an axe and ap-
roaching the home of Wesley Chamber,
a negro cotton picker, called to him to
come out. The responded
negro and
Craddock whispered something in his ear.
As the negro turned to go in the house,
Craddock split his head with an axe.
When Chambers fell on the ground Crad-
dock frightfully mutilated the body with
his weapon.
He then walked across the open ground
about the Chambers cabin and observing
Dana Washington, a negro, crept
him and struck him on the head with upon the
sharp edge of the instrument. Not satisfied
with this crime, Craddock went to the
door of Chambers' cabin and called Mercer
, the brother of Wesley Chambers.
Suspecting nothing, Chambers came to
the door and was immediately beaten
down with the axe and frighfully maimed
. Mercer Chambers died this afternoon
and Dana Washington cannot live.
After leaving the house Craddock
walked to Taylortown and mingled with
the negroes there. He was perfectly unconcerned
when captured, and admitted
the killing of the three men, saying he
did it just for" fun."
Craddock was caught by a small posse
of white men, but a crowd of 300. composed
largely of negroes, took possession
of the murderer. He was at once hanged
to a tree and burned beneath it after being
pronounced dead.
The men killed were inoffensive,
working negroes. hard

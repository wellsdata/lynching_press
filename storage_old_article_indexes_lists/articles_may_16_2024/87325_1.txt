CONFESSES.
The Lynching of Six Colored Men at
Kerrville, Tenn.
A Son of Memphis' Sheriff One of the
Lynchers, and Tells All About It- Jaller
Cox Arrested
for Perjury- False
Representations Said to Be Made.
MEMPHIS, Tenn., Sept. 10.- The
whole plot of the Kerrville lynching is
now laid bare. Before hours
many
elapse it is thought every one who had
anything to do with the affair, or the
majority of them, will be behind the
bars.
Bob McCarver, son sheriff McCarver,
gave the snap away. He was invited
to participate in the massacre by A. N.
Smith, one of the men now languishing
in the county jail under indict-
ment for murder in the first degree.
When the invitation to assist in the
assassination was tendered to McCaring
ver it was represented that Sheriff
McCarver knew all about it, and that
Judge Cooper, of the criminal court,
was not in the dark.
Of course, these representations were
untrue, and were made by Smith for
the purpose, if possible, of mixing
Sheriff McCarver up in the affair
through his son, so that his hands
would be tied if an investigation
should be instituted by the authorities
. The scheme was a bold one, but
failed.
McCarver's examination resulted in
the arrest of Jailer Cox for perjury and
the fixing of a$ 10,000 bond on McCarver
to insure his remaining in the city.
McCarver did not give this bond Sat
urday, and, as a consequence; spent the
day behind the big gate of the Shelby
county bastile, nominally as deputy,
but really a prisoner. Sheriff Mc
Carver had been told of the plot by his
son several days before the grand jury
got hold of the boy's story, and be
cause he did not tell what he knew to
the inquisitors he is receiving censure.
He and Judge Cooper had a long conversation
Saturday night, and it is said
the judge read the riot act to the
that high sheriff.

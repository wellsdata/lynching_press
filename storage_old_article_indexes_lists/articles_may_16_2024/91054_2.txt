Fifteen persons today surrounded the
house of Sam Padgett, a negro, whom
they suspected of harboring a negro
who had criminally assaulted Mrs.

search the house. Permission was
given, but when within thirty feet of
the house, those inside the building
opened fire on the posse, Instantly killIng
John Hare and seriously wounding
Barlow Pearson, James Daniel and Dr.
J. L. Kennedy. The posse then returned
the fire, killing Padgett and one
of his daughters, and wounding two
other girls, aged six and thirteen, and
two of Padgett's sons, twenty and
twenty- two.
The posse then retired for reinforcements
. The news spread rapidly
and by 10 o'clock 500 armed men were
oa the scene and started in pursuit of
the negroes who had escaped. One of
them was captured and taken before
Mrs. Moore but she failed to identify
him. The negro, however, was identified
as the man who shot Hare and he
was started for the Reidsvillo jall, together
with Padwett's wife and son.
On the way the officers were over
taken by about seventy- five men, who
took the prisoners from them. The
woman was told to run, and as she did
so was riddled with bullets, her son be-
outing shot to pieces where he stood.
The negro who assaulted Mrs. Moore
has not been captured, but it is reported
that he is surrounded in a negro
and that in all probability he has
house been killed.

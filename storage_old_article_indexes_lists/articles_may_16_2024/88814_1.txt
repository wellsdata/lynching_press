Des Moines Leader, Dem: Alabama
seems determined to keep ahead of
Ohio in the matter of lynching Negroes,
and on Saturday night five, two men
and three women, were strung up near
Greenville.
What vindication cf justice
was it to take shivering and shrinking
wretches and to punish one crime commit
another? Out upon these blotches
upon American civilization whatever
their locus may be. They are outrages
as to which no condemnation can be
too severe. Such crimes are infinely
more injurious than any private one.
Community corruption is a greater
than individual corruption. evil

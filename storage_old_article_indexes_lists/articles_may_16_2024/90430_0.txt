" I beg to say that I am correctly reported
to this extent: I said in my canvass two
years ago, and I say now, that, Governor,
as I am, I would lead a mob to lynch any
man, white or black, who had ravished any
woman, white or black. I am on record
as having asked the Legislature to give
me power to remove any sheriff who allowed
any prisoner to be lynched within
his custody. I have ordered out the militia
to protect prisoners whenever called on
by sheriffs. I am opposed to lynch law
for anything but rape. That is a crime
which, in my opinion, places any man beyond
pale of the law, and puts him below
the brutes. The Southern people are not
blameless in dealing with the lynching
question, but all our lynchings are not of
negroes, and but for the fact that every
outbreak of the kind is used as a text by
Republican newspapers to slander and misrepresent
our people, they would excite
no more comment than elsewhere in the
United States. I think statistics will show
that lynchings occur as often in Western
Northern States as they do in the
and South."

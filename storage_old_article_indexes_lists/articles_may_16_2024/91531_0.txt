the murder of R. A. Stillwell, an El-
more county farmer.
Soon after reports reached the governor's
office that a mob had overpowered
the jail attache at Wetump-
ka and removed the negroes, Mont-
gomery militia were hurried to the
autos. However, they were
scene in
too late to prevent the lynching.
Stillwell was shot several days ago
while guarding his barns against
thieves. Bloodhounds led directly, it

Smith negroes, who were arrested.
Searching parties later found the
negroes hanging in the woods five
miles from Wetumpka. Three supposed
members of the mob are in jail
at Wetumpka, but their names have
not been revealed.
Governor O'Neil has ordered a
special session of the Elmore county
grand jury to investigate the lynchings

Three Montgomery militia compan-
remained at Wetumpka through-
ies out the day.

MOB LYNCHES NEGRO
IN SOUTH CAROLINA
Motive Which Led to Crime
Mystery- Six Men
Implicated
Columbia, S. C., December 21 .-- Not
more than six men are believed to have
been implicated in
the lynching of John
Felder, a negro who was taken from
the city jail of Norway, near here, and
shot to death last night. The motive
that led to the lynching is thus far a
mystery. The only crime charged
against the negro was obtaining goods
under false pretenses and his employers
had settled the case before the
tragedy.
Investigation by Magistrate Tyler of
Norway today showed the tracks of
only two buggies that led from the
road to the scene where the negro's
body with his hands
tied and guarded
,
by an ownerless black dog, was found.
This his led the authorities to believe
that the mob was a small one.
The was shot through
negro the
head, and then beat until his skull was
crushed, fragments of the butt of a
used in the assault being
found revolver near the negro's body.

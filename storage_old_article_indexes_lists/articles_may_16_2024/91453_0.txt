MOB LAW IN KANSAS.
Murderer Oliphant Lynched in Topeka
Before 10,000 People.
TOPEKA, Kan., June 6.- A man giving
the name of Nat Oliphant, who was suspected
of having shot A. L. Rogers and
wife Tuesday morning, was captured by
the police in the afternoon and lodged in
jail. Late at night the crowd wnich surrounded
the jail forced its way inside to
get him, first beating back the police
force and severely injuring Chief of Police
Gardner and Officer Bufford.
Considerable difficulty was experienced
in finding the cell where Oliphant was
confined, but after two hours' work and
breaking open several cells the murderer
was found and dragged into the street.
He confessed the crime and begged the
crowd to hang him in such a manner as
to break his neck.
He was taken in front of the First National
bank, the most prominent corner
in Topeka, and hanged to a telegraph
pole. A crowd of probably 10,000 people
including hundreds of women, witnessed
the execution.
The electric lights made it as bright
as day, and the crowd lingered for an
hour or more gazing at the body. Mr.
Rodgers, the victim of the murderous
burglar, is dead, and Mrs. Rodgers'
covery is very doubtful. re-

James K. Vardaman, notwithstanding
all the mean things he spits out
,
against the Negro while serving as
Governor of Mississippi, marched at
the head of his troops and prevented
the mob from lynching a Negro in
the capital of that state, himself
threatening to shoot the first man
who attempted to take the law in his
hands
own.

HOAX. The papers were filled last week with
terrible account of riot and murders committed
sear Georgetown, Ohio, in consequence of an attempt
by certain Kentuckiane to capture their runaway
slaves. The story was that the Kentucki-
ans were resisted by the Abalsionists in the neighborhood
, and that several lives were lost in the riot
, and a negro lynched by hanging. The whole
a hoax gotten up
turns out to be lying, by some
mischievous creature, who doubtless has had much
enjoyment in the excitement which his
has produced. statement

LEBERG LYNCHED
MOB OF MASKED MEN HANG DESPERATE
MURDERER.
AT THE LAS ANIMAS JAIL
Lynching Party Made Up of Disciplined
Men Under Leadership-
Sheriff and Force Overpowered and
Disarmed.
Denver.- A Republican special from
Las Animas, Colorado, Thursday night
says: Infuriated by the fiendieshness
of the crime and by their failure to
lynch Leberg last night, fifty masked
men, heavily armed, tonight broke into
the jail, overpowered Sheriff John D.
Brown and two deputies, bound and
gagged them, and threw them into a
cell.
They then secured Lars Leberg, the
murderer of Henry Lanvenmeyer, and
hung him to a telegraph pole in the
rairead yards an hour after they attacked
the fail.
The lynching was done so quietly
that only those directly concerned in
the hanging knew anything unusual
was about to occur, and it was fully
an hour after the man was dead before
the people generally knew that
Leberg had paid the penalty of his
crime.
The disorderly, leaderless mob of
last night was transformed into a
thoroughly disciplined body of men under
a leader whose commands were
obeyed with alacrity. There was no
shouting, no shooting, no loud talking.
and sh man was secured from the jail
and taken out in less than an hour
from the time the lynchers started to
make their way into the jail.
The men who meted out death to
the
Leberg met little resistance at
hands of the peace officers. When the
mob arrived at the jail they sought
these officers and before they could
offer resistance they were helpless.
While it is believed that Leberg was
insane, the feeling against the man
was so intense that the avengers
would not risk his being declared in.
same by the courts, so that the murder
of the popular farmer would go unavenged
.
Nothing can be learned as to the
identity of the men who to- night took
justice into their own hands, but it is
generally believed that they were
close friends of the murdered farmer
and from the section where the deceased
lived and where the atrocious
crime was committed.
The people of the city generally believed
that the attempt to lynch Le
berg had been given up, as during the
day there were no demonstations of
any sort against the man and no
threats made openly that he would be
made to pay the death penalty for his
fiendish crime.
Before Las Animas knew that the
man had been hanged Leberg had
been dead more than an hour.
Details of the arrival of the lynching
party at the jail were divulged by
two negroes confined in the jail for
petty offenses.
It was just 8:45 when the fifty men,
completely armed, made their appear-
anee at the jail and demanded of the
sheriff that the prisoner, Leberg, be
turned over to them. The demand met
with instand refusal.
Without further words the leaders
of the mob disarmed and overpowered
Sheriff Brown, Marshal McCune and
Undersheriff McAffee.
The three men were then gagged
and bound, thrown into a cell and left
there while the mob began the effort
to get Leberg out of the steel cage in
which he was confined.
The work of the mob last night had
made entrance to the jail comparatively
easy. All that was left between
the mob and the prisoner was the steel
gage, which the mob last night battered
in vain.
With the fifty men was one who was
evidently well acquainted with the
mechanism of the lock on the steel
cage. The lock last night resisted all
efforts of the mob, but in a few minutes
tonignt the locksmith of the party
managed to break it and effect an entrance
to the cell of Leberg.
When the avengers arrived at the
ja Leberg was in bed. When he
heard them he got up and dressed, and
when the men broke into the cell he
met them calmly and allowed the leaders
to put a rope around his neck with
out resistance.
In thirty minutes, that is at 9:15,
Leberg was brought out of the cell,
and the rope put around his neck. He
was then led by the mob to a telegraph
pole in the railroad yards about 150
yards from the jail.
Without evidence of excitement, and
with absolutely no noise, the rope was
hoisted over an arm of the pole and
Leberg was jerked twenty feet off the
ground by twenty men.
No shots were fired at the body, and
there was absolutely no other demonstration
.
While it is believed by many that
Leberg was insane, and that no sane
man could have committed the crime
charged against him, the feeling ran
so high among the friends of his victim
, who are believed to have been the
men who composed the mob who hung
Leberg, that nothing would satisfy
them except the meting out of
-mary punishment. sum-

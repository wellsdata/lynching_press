The time. Is here when we have to
remind the American Congress, that
we are cognizant of the obligation
they owe us. It was the Good Old
Republican Party which saw that a
government could not peacefully
flourish by dealing absolute justice to
some of its people and stintingly deal
out; justice to at least 12,000,000 of its
most reliable American citizens.
We are soliciting the support of ev
ery person, every church, every sock-
ety, every association, every club, and
every organization in every town, city
and county in the United States to
affiliate with the Blaine Invincible
Republican Club, which has been in
existence in the National Capital since
1874..
We want to have delegates to re-
present every congressional district,
Our only protection from the Amer
lean Government will be result of or-
ganization.
The convention will organize, all
Negro forces in the United States to
advovcate protection of Negro, inter-
est-Life, Liberty and Happiness.
The Convention will be called to
meet at 12 o'clock Noon on November

in December the Convention will have
prepared and made ready to place be

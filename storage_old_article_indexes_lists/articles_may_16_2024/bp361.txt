RANDOLPH SUGGESTS
CITIZEN ADVISORS
ON RACE PROBLEMS
CHICAGO, Feb. 5.-"The Fort Bragg military killing;
the racial military riot in Alexandria, Louisiana in which Ne
gro soldiers were shot by white military and civilian police;
the outrageous and widespread discriminations against Ne
in government depart-:
create a state of inter- and intra-
racial temper that is definitely un-
healthy and threatening from both
the point of view of the Negro
people and the Government and
requires fundamental action,‚Äù says
A. Philip Randolph, international
president of the Brotherhood of
Sleeping Car Porters and national
director of the March on Wash-.
ington Movement.
RACIAL OUTBUKST
MAY INCREASE
"Action in behalf of the Negro
should not only be curative, but
also prophylactic. Because of the
confused and chaotic
manner. in!
which questions relating to Ne
groes are approached by the Gov-
ernment, there is ample reason to
believe that riots, lynchings and
discriminations affecting Negroes in
military and civilian life will in-
crease during the war," states Ran-
dolph.
"If the Negro people and the
Government do not move to plan
the adoption of policies and ma-
chinery that can effectively grapple
with these wild outbursts of racial
hatred and studied forms of dis-
criminations, the forces of racial
prejudice will soon get entirely out
of hand," further observed
dolph in the Midwestern
quarters of the Brotherhood.

Clark demanding investigation of
the Georgia lynching and to President

Trenton Case
In the Trenton case six young
Negro men have been found guilty
of killing a white man by an all-
white jury, and sentenced to death
by the trial judge.
CRC said:
" The six men are drugged to
near insensibility, beaten with rubber
hose and kept incommunicado
for four days before bringing them
before a magistrate. Thus a' confession
' was obtained.
" Three witnesses to the murder
were all unable to identify any of
the six men as the culprits.
" All of the condemn men were
able to account for their whereabouts
with incontrovertible evidence
.
" The prosecution has refused to
produce the finger print report on
the murder weapon.
" Despite these facts New Jersey's
prosecutor has stated that he will
fight to carry out the trial judge's
death sentence even if he becomes
convinced of the men's innocence."
O. John Rogge heads the defense
panel.
CRC asked groups to call its office
, MA 6-5121, 307 S. Broadway,
a speaker on the Trenton or the
for latest Georgia lynching case.

FEARS DYNAMITING.
BUTLER, PA, SHERIFF HAS JAIL
GUARDED.
HEAVILY
Sennett Said He Was Drunk- His
Brutal Crime- Attacks Made
Ion Jail by Mob.
Butler, Pa., Sept. 15.- Apprehen-
slon was caused late last evening by
the story that a gang of men intendel
to attack the jail and make an attempt
during the night to dynamite
the building. In order to protect himself
Sheriff Hoon has had the street
leading to the jail roped off, and has
placed guards armed with rifles to
keep the crowd back of the ropes.
In addition to the outside guards
the sheriff has a strong posse inside
the jail heavily armed.
The prevailing opinion appears to
be that an extra session of quarter
sessions court should be convened.
Judge Miller will hold court here on
Tuesday and Bennett could by pleading
guilty save the county an extra
expense and mitigate his sentence to
some extent.
Members of Mob May Be Arrested.
It is probable that arrests will be
made for Baturday night's lot as
soon as Bennett has been safely dis-
succeeded in
posed of. The officers
getting a long list of names of persons
who participated in the attack
on the jail and prosecutions will follow
.
At 6 o'clock last evening no response
had been received to the message
sent to the Governor Saturday
night requesting aid to protect the
jail. and it is not now thought that
the assistance of the state troops will
be needed.
Bennett appeared to be indifferent
to his fate last night and said he was
drunk and didn't know what hap-
happened.
The condition of the little Wagner
girl was improving last night and her
attend.ng physician says she will get
well unless blood poisoning should develop
unlooked for complications
arise. and

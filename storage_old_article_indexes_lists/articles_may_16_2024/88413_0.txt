An editorial in the Galveston News is
on the same tune. The News is opposed
to all forms of lawlessness, but it believes
that our lynchings are the protest
of the people against the delay and uncertainty
of the law. It says that the
wise constitutional provision for a
speedy trial is, as a rule, disregarded by
the courts of the country. Our contemporary
goes on to say
" It has been only a few: years since a
there is something wrong with the law
or its administration. If there were not
this shortcoming in one or the other, the
lynching would not occur. The crime for
which, more than any other, it is inflicted
, or threatened, is the outraging of
women and young girls, and there is a
growing conviction in the public mind
that the legal penalties generally provided
this do not adequately punish
it." for

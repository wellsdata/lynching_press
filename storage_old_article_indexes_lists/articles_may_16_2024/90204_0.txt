Argument was heard before the Supreme
Court yesterday morning in the suit
brought by the coroner of Sullivan county
to oust John S. Dudley, sheriff of that
county, for alleged failure to protect the
negro taken from him and lynched while
en route from Illinois. The coroner was
represented by Deputy Attorney General
Cassius C. Hadley. John B. Elam and
John S. Bays appeared for the sheriff.
The argument involved the constitution-
Ã¡lity of the law which provides for the removal
of a sheriff from office without a
hearing if a prisoner is taken from him
and killed by a mob. The sheriff's counsel
argued that as the office of sheriff was a
constitutional office he could only be removed
after a judicial hearing.
The Circuit Court of Sullivan county held
that Dudley should not be removed
the coroner appealed the case. and

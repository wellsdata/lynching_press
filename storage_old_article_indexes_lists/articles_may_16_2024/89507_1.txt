Atlanta, September 10. Fearing a
demonstration similar to the lynching
in Cumming today, the five prisoners
held at Marietta in connection with
an assault on a white woman at Cumming
last week, were spirited to At-
lanta tonight.
The prisoners were taken to Marietta
Saturday after a clash between whites
and negroes at Cumming was averted
by the arrival of two companies of
state militia. Bitter feeling against the
led the officials to rush thein
prisoners to Atlanta.

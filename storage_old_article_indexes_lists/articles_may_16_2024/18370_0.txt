WHY CHIAVINI
QUIT BUSINESS
Personal Liberty of a Merchant Is
Crushed to Earth.
TELLS A HARD LUCK STORY
SMELTER BUILDERS' NEW WAY
TO ENFORCE TEMPERANCE.
Fernando Chiavini and the demon hard
luck continue to grapple. The earlier
phases of their struggle were told in
The Herald a few weeks ago. Just after
the big Bingham fire, Chiavini, whose
place was destroyed with all his belongings
, including clothing, was placed in
jail to protect him from the violence of
a mob that threatened to lynch him on
suspicion that he started the fire. He
was proven guiltless of this and came to
Salt Lake City. Here he was arrested
for violation of the internal revenue laws
and several days in jail and much importuning
of friends succeeded in raising
enough money to settle with the government
. At the jai! door a horde of
hungry creditors awaited him. Chiavini
gave up his few remaining dollars, as
signed his property insurance and his life
insurance, persuaded some of his creditors
to dismiss suits they had filed against
him and, in borrowed clothing started
out at the age of 56 to carve his, fortune.

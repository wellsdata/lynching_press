The actions of the one thousand Ne-
groes who attempted to mob and lynch
James Washington is certainly to be
deplored, and it was the manifestation
of that vindictive and intolerant spirit
which the Negroes muust get rid of
before they are in a position to condemn
mob and lynch law in the South.
Stringing up Washington and threatening
to cimmit acts of violence upon
his wife who were both innocent of
violating the laws or committing any
crime, would not restore the man Cur-
tis or Cole to his loved ones, and they
should have sense enough to know this
If those who particcipated in the
mob desire to assist in lightening the
burden of Mrs. Curtis let them con-
tribuute something for the suupport of
herself and childl and petition Govern-
McMillan of Tennessee to pardon
or Courtis.

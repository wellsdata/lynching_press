I am not pleading for social equality,
but I am asking for plain simple justice
. I am. pleading that we share in
this world wide democracy for which
our and our b
our brothers are row
ons
shedding their blood in No Man's Land.
I am asking this government whose call
they have answered to break down the
bars of prejudice, cut loose the chains
of oppression and wipe out segregation
and jim- crowism. I am asking
that this government enact a law that
will make mob violence and lynching a
federal crime, so that our women will
not be hanged from the trees in Georgia
while they give birth to their babes
and that our sons, our fathers and our
brothers may not be chained to the
stake in Tennessee and made human
torches of and parts of their bodies dismembered
and taken away as souvenirs
and their heads severed from their
charred bodies and thrown into the
of our august bodies while they
midst are in convention assembled.

Two More Victims of
Lynch Law in Alabama
A
SERIES of attacks on white
women in Montgomery by
negroes caused the inevitable lynching
yesterday. Near the state convict
farm two negroes, both of them
former soldiers, who were charged
with attacks on white women, were
the victims of a mob. One of the
negroes was killed outright, the other
was shot fifteen times and clubbed
into unconsciousness. He was taken
to a hospital and, so violent was the
feeling against him, the location of
the hospital was kept secret for fear
the mob might take him from the
operating room and finish its work.
While attention throughout the
country was centered on Omaha, the
irony of fate prompted another outbreak
in Alabama, which shares with
Georgia, Mississippi and other southern
states the unenviable reputation
of constituting the" lynching belt."
While there is a disposition in some
parts of the south to call attention
to every example of mob violence or
race riot in the north with a smug
satisfaction, as if to show that we are
all tarred by the same stick, that
policy won't do.
Lynchings are a disgrace wherever
they occur and always inexcusable
for the simple fact that no guilty
rapist would stand a ghost of a chance
to escape hanging if his fate rested
with a jury.
The war can hardly be blamed for
recent activities of mobs, although
is significant that former negro sol- it
diers were the latest victims in Ala-
bama. Lynchings were numerous long
before the war and they continue de-
all efforts made to prevent them.

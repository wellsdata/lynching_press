LYNCHING STAY A
TROOPS CALLED TO
For Worth, Texas, May 16.- State
troops continue on guard today at the
Tarrant county jail to prevent the
lynching of Tom Lee, the negro who
killed
yesterday Ogiltree
Policeman
and wounded three men before he took
refuge in a sewer and shot himself.
Last night's rioting resulted in considerable
property damage in the
negro section of the city, practically
every house on East Ninth street occupied
or frequented by negroes, being
wrecked. Big fires fed principally
by liquors and trash were 4started
early today by small crowds but the
activity of the police and property
owners prevented the flames
gaining any headway. from

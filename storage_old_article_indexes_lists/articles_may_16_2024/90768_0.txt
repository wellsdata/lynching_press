CIVILIZATION THIS?
A short while ago Missis-
sippi distinguished herself by
lynching a Negro and his wife
on the charge of attempting
to burn a barn. Now comes
Georgia and goes her one bet-
ter by lynching a Negro fath-
er, his 11 year old son and his
two daughters on the charge
of beating a policeman. Here
we have the whole mockery
of the defense for lynching
stripped bare, leaving nothing
as an excuse but naked brutality
and savagery.
A father and his three children
dragged from jail. The
four of them hanged from the
same tree and with the same
rope. First, the father before
the eyes of his trembling
children; the son before the
eyes of his sisters; then the
shrieking girls. praying for
their lives, one after the other
the four bodies riddled with
bullets and laid in a row. And
for what? Because they dared
lay hands on a a white man; and
this they did, most likely, if
the truth were known, to eject
him from their home because
he had entered without the
proper legal authority.
Run your eyes over a chart
of the world and see if you
can ond a single land where
such a deed could be done,
and cause so little public concern
. You at once skip over
the countries of Europe, even
though they are in a state of
war. You cannot put your
finger upon Japan or China or
the colonies of Africa or the
islands of the Pacific. You
can point only to the United
States, the great example of
democracy,
Except for a voice here and
there, the country is silent.
Instead of sensitiveness, there
is apathy. It is as though the
nation's moral senses are
numbed and paralyzed. A
nation of hypocrites. You
are shocked and pained because
German soldiers, per-
haps accidently, knock the
head off some old statue in a
Belgian cathedral. You fill
the press with letters against
this vandalism, this barbarism
this set back to civilization.
You even feel that the fearful
atrocities being committed in
in Europe. paintings destroyed
, libraries being demolished,
holes being shot through old,
worm eaten churches.
What have you to say abou
this reversion to barbarity in
your own midst? What have
you to say about this breaking
down of your own civilization?
What action will the great
state of Georgia take? What
sentiment will the citizens of
Georgia express upon this
crime at Monticello? What
open judgment will the nation
pronounce upon this atrocity
committed within its own
bounds, by and against its own
citizens? -J. W. Johnson in
The Age.,

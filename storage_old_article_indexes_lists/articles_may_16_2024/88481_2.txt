lynched.
Three Distinct Movements
Subsequently and a little afterwards the
mob returned and took John Cerami and
lynched him. In this circumstantial way
the report brings out that the mob made
three distinct movements against the
Italians and there was sufficient time for
the blood to cool and for the anger of the
lynchers to abate after they had disposed
of the first two men. Particular importance
is laid upon this feature, for while
it is said there may have been some extenuating
circumstances in visiting such summary
punishment on those immediately
concerned in the affray with Dr. Hodges,
yet the time elapsing before the second
and third lynchings is regarded as an
elaborate atrocity. The full report has
been forwarded to the Italian office and a
of it placed in the hands of the state
department copy.

on the case. After going to vari-
ous points in the state where Cheek
had been employed by whites, these
educators found that, in the first

gerous for him to remain oh his
farm. This same white farmer also
stated, according to one of the edu-
cators, that he could, and would

farmer is willing and will write his
testimony.

NAACP 50th Anniversary 50th Anniversary

In the South, the Negro had been
stripped of his basic citizenship
rights which had been purchased

northern states, where the Abolitionist zeal
was beginning to wane. Sgregation in edu-
cation was taking hold in certain northern
cities. Discrimination in the trade unions.

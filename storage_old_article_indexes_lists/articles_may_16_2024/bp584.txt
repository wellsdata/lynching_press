"killed by unknown parties" was in
the making.
Fate, however, had decided other-
wise, and to bring the murderer to
justice steered the investigating of-
ficers to the home of young Holley,
where they found a dew-spattered
shotgun, which had been recently
fired. The callber of the gun tailled
with that from which the death-deal-
ing shell had beon fired, and young
Holley was placed under arrest.
The youth denied that he had
killed Canon, but under cross-exam-
ination con ssed that he had fired
the shot. Testimony by the youth
and his elderly sweetheart that on
Saturday evening young Holley 'had
gone with Mrs. Canon, as usual, to
deliver several â€œwashings." En route
home they bought a few drinks and
took a ride to sober up a bit.
In the meantime the tired husband
was awaiting his soul-mate, who ar-
rived just about midnight, in com-
pany with her white lover. He up-
braided both of them and threatened
to kill the youth. Just as dawn was
breaking on Sunday morning Canon
was aroused by a noise on the out-
side and went to investigate. His
wife had evidently heard the noise
before he had, as already she was
out of the house.
As Canon reached the doorstep a
shot was fired and he fell to the
ground mortally wounded from a
gunshot wound inflicted by his wife's
lover, while she stood by the white
youth's side. Not only did she stand
by his side as he fired the shot which
killed her husband, but in her testi-
mony she declared that her husband
was armed and that the white youth

shot in self-defense. This theory,
however, did not mean much becauso
neighbors who rushed to the scene
of the killing declared that no re-
volver was near the body when they
found it, nor was there one near the
house. It is reported that the woman |
found one in a corn patch a little
before the inquest was held.
Standing on the spot where his
victim had fallen Holley told of the
gruesome killing, acknowledging that
he was fond of Mrs. Canon, but deny-a
ing that there had ever been any im-1:
proper relations between them.
Neighbors, however, expressed a dif-
ferent view in their testimony, and
the youth was held, charged with
murder in the first degree, while his
lover was charged with being an ac-,
complice.
A study of the dead man's effects
revealed that he had a trifle more t
than $1000 worth of life insurance,
of which his wife was the benefactor.l:

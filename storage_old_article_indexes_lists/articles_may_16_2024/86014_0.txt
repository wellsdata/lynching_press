Murderer Lynched- Another Admitted
to Bail.
NEW ALBANY, IND., June 29.-
About two o'clock this morning a mob,
estimated at from twenty- five to forty
in number, masked and heavily armed,
went to the jail in Salem Indiana and
,,
demanded the keys of the jail the
deputy sheriff. He refused them from; they,
however, found the key to the outside
door of the jail, and then took a sledgehammer
and knocked the locks and
fastenings from the cell- door, in which
was confined Delos Heffren, charged
with the murder of D. Halstead, a few
days ago. Heffren showed fight, but
retreated to the inner cell, when the
mob threw fire balls into the cell, and
two
or three shots hitting him. There
were twenty- two or twenty- three
balls picked in all where Heffren
up
stood. After wounding him, they took
him to the railroad bridge, about thirty
rods from the depot, and hung him,
after which the mob disappeared as suddenly
and mysteriously as it appeared.
About four o'clock Heffren was taken
down. At the coroner's inquest the examining
physician said the shots which
hit him would not have produced death.
There is a terrible excitement in the
town.
H. Thompson, justice of the peace at
Greenville, this county, who shot and
killed Riebolm yesterday, was admitted
to bail in the sum of ten thou-
dollars last evening.

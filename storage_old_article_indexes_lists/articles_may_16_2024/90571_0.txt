Victim of a Mob Shot One of His Assailants
Before He Was Lynched.
Columbla, S. C., Feb. 28.- Two days
ago Henry Saxon, a young man, went
to Greenville and obtained board at
the house of James Green. He was an
old acquaintance of Mrs. Green and his
conduct in the house aroused the jealousy
of Green, who consulted with his
friends at the Mills cotton factory.
They decided to" regulate" Saxon, and
a mob came to the Green house that
night, overpowered Saxon and' took him
to the woods, the intention being to
give him a whipping and run him out
of town Later in the night one of
the regulators, Thomas S. Wilson, was
brought home shot through the body.
He lived thirty- six hours, but although
able to talk would make no statement
even to his family. His friends were also
reticent.
This reticence has been explained by
the discovery of the dead body of Sax-
on where it had been buried in the
woods. The man had been riddled with
bullets. It is supposed that Saxon, unknown
' to the crowd, had a pistol, that
he used it before being whipped, and
was himself shot dead. The coroner is
making investigations and a number of
arrests will made.

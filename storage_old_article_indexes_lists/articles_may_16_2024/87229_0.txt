The Rochester( N. Y.) Democrat says
that the Rev. F. Starr. Jr., a Presbyterian
clergyman for three years past settled at
Weston, Platte Co., Missouri, has arrived at
Rochester, having been expelled from Wes-
ton by the same gang of pro- Slavery ruffians
who threw the types and presses of the Park-
ville Luminary into the river. They gave
him notice to quit within two days under
penalty of being lynched, and deemed it
prudent to leave. It does not appear that he
had ever preached slavery, but only
that he was a clergyman against of Northern origin.

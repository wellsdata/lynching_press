On Sunday night last, about 10
o'clock, a company of masked men,
numbering some eight or ten, visited
the residence of Wm. McElwee, Esq.,
three miles from Rockwood, went to a
barn, some two hundred yards from
the house, and caught a black boy
about seventeen years old, dragging
him out of the bed where he was sleeping
by the feet. The screams of the
lad aroused the family, and Mr. Geo.
Nixon and Rev. J. O. Shelley went immediately
to the rescue of the boy. Mr.
Nixon succeeded in snatching a mask
from the head of one of the party
.
When the boy commenced screaming,
the mob fell to beating him with a
club, and on the approach of the
family the party commenced firing
and throwing stones. The boy was
considerably braised, and Mr. Nixon
received a slight wound on his head
with a stone. The mob then left.
What would have been the result had
the family not been awakened by the
loud crying of the, we are unable
to say. boy
First, there was a negro murderer
and a ravisher of a white girl hung by

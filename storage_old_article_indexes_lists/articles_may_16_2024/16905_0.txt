It is a subject of devout thanksgiving to God that
experience has demonstrated the soundness of the doctrines
of a large majority of the Abolitionists of Great
Britain and the United States, that they are consistent
with the best interests of mankind, in accordance
with true philosophy and pure Christianity; that the
measures adopted to communicate these important
truths to the people of this country, with a view to
about the
bring peaceful Abolition of Slavery have
,
been so consistent with these principles; and that these
doctrines and measures have been so signally overruled
and blessed in furtherance of the cause of Emancipation
, Republican Liberty, and Christian Freedom.
Reflecting men can see that, amid all the opposition,
violence, threats, and machinations of Slaveholders and
their abettors, the cause of Liberty has steadily advanced
, and is about to be brought to a glorious consummation
. And it ought to inspire the people of
this country with gratitude, that such a momentous
moral reformation, affecting the temporal and eternal
welfare of millions of people, in this and coming generations
, is to be achieved at no greater sacrifice. So
deeply involved were the people of this country in the
guilt of oppression and prejudice, that probably nothing
short of murders under lynch law, profligate expenditures
of life and property, war, robbery and conquest
, and audacious attempts to defend, extend, and
perpetuate Slavery, would have aroused the people of
the Free States to a consideration of impending danger
, and inspired them with a determination to avert
it. Much as the unconstitutional annexation of Tex-
as, with the consequent war with Mexico, is deplored,
this great calamity and ineffaceable National reproach
will, we doubt not, be overruled for downfall of
the politicians who perpetrated the enormous the evil, and

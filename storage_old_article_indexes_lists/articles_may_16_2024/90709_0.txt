One can conceive of an element
of white voters of no unusual intelligence
and information combining
with Negro" Democrats" in
support of a white candidate, although
these voters in the white
population are the element most
intolerant of Negroes, most prejudiced
against them, most likely
to mob them, lynch them if
mobs and lynchers shall ever
be in South Carolina. again

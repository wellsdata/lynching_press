FOUR NEGROES LYNCHED.
Sequel to the Shooting of a White Man
at Phoenix,
Augusta, Ga., November 9.- A special
to the Chronicle from Greenwood, S. C.,
says:
" A telephone message from Phoenix,
the scene of the race riot in this county
at nine o'clyock to- night reports all quiet
at that hour. About forty armed men
are on duty there. Four negroes were
lynched near Phoenix about two o'clock
this afternoon. Positive evidence was
secured that they were implicated in the
shooting of the white men yesterday.
About one hundred white men participated
in the lynching and there was no
attempt at disguise or concealment.
All is quiet here at this hour though
more trouble is expected in the Phoenix
section. The efforts that have been made
prevent blood- shed have so far been
of to no avail.

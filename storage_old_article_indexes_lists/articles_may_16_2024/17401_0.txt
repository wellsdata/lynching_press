Things have indeed come to a pretty pass,
. when the people of Ohio- that is, the Abolition
portion of them, who cry out so much against
Lynch laware compelled to seek refuge for
their prisoners in the jails of Kentucky."
The Sheriff of Adams county, has been in Co-
lumbus and lodged his prisoners safely in the
Penitentiary. He was hurrying to the cars
when we saw him and we had no time to ask
of him any questions. redet
There is not any doubt but what the excitement
produced by the horrid conduct of the negro
and his subsequently being hung, added
greatly to the subsequent attempts to rescue
from the hands of the Sheriff, the white
derers on trial.- Statesman. mur-

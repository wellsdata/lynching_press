N. A. A. C. P. SENDS
TELEGRAM OF PROTEST
LYNCHING TO
AGAINST GOV. OF LOUISIANA
The National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People today
sent to Governor R. G. Pleasant of
Louisiana a telegram of protest
against the lynching of a Negro in the
courthouse yard at Monroe, La., on
March 16. The Association's telegram
calls attention to the fact that this is
the third protest which it has been
compelled to make against lynchings
in Louisiana within the last six weeks
involving five Negroes lynched on
three separate occasions and that no
reply to the Association's previous requests
for information or public state-
Louisiana's attitude to-
ment as to
ward these lynchings had been made
by Governor Pleasant. Similar telegrams
were sent to the Chambers of
Commerce of New Orleans, Baton
Rouge, Shreveport and Monroe. The
telegram follows:
March 18, 1918.
Hon. R. G. Pleasant, Governor,
Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
Sir:
Associated. Press dispatches of
March 16 report that George McNeel,
a Negro, suspected of a crime but
neither tried nor found guilty, was
lynched in the court house yard at
Monroe, Louisiana, on the above date.
The National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People, composed
of representative citizens of
both races, addresses you for the third
time within six weeks to ask, in the
name of its one hundred branches and
ten thousand members, for whom it
speaks directly, and in the name of
the law- abiding citizens of the whole
country what steps Louisiana proposes
to, take to vindicate her law. On
February sixth, we addressed you concerning
the lynching of one Negro, on
March sixth, concerning the lynching
of three Negroes. No reply has been
made to us nor have we seen any
statement in the public press which
would indicate your appreciation as
Governor of the State of the position
in which Louisiana's mob actions
place the nation at this time when nato
tional prestige abroad demands high
regard for law and order at home.
Does Louisiana wish the nation and
her own thousands of colored soldiers
now serving their country in the battle
for democracy, to understand that
she will not protect black men ac-
apcused of crime and that mobs may
visit their vengeance upon Negroes
without let or hindrance by the constituted
authorities of your state?
What shall we inform the newspapers
who receive our press service regarding
Louisiana's attitude?
JOHN R. SHILLADY, Secretary,
Association for the Advance-
National ment of Colored People.

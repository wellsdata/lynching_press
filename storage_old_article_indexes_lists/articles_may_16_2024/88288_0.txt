The Lake City Lynchiug.
HE trial of the
Τι
Lake City, S. C.,
lynchers is making rapid progress
and the prosecution seems
to be forming a very strong case. One
of the mob has turned state's evidence
. He took the stand Wednesday
and told a story that makes the blood
run cold. The lynching
of the negro
postmaster Baker was as carefully and
deliberately planned as anything could
be The mob was not acting under the
heat of sudden and powerful passion,
like that which stirs up a Southern
community after a negro has committed
a crime against a
woman.
Baker's only offense was that he had
accepted the postmastership from
President McKinley. In view of the
race hatred existing in the South, in
South Carolina particularly, the wisdom
of the appointment may be doubted
, but that is neither here nor there
when the fearful crime of the defendants
is considered. It appears that the
ringleader was a man named Stokes.
To make an effectual job of it, he proposed
that they set fire to the postoffice
from the outside and shoot Baker when
he was driven forth by the flames. This
diabolical scheme was more than carried
out, for not only Baker but his
wife and children fell victims to the
sassins' bullets. as-
Whether a South Carolina jury will
have the courage to deal out justice to
the cowardly murderers is a question
that the country is anxiously waiting to
see answered. Public opinion against
lynching negroes is very lax in the
South. There are laws enough on the
subject, but the lynchers care nothing
for them. They set out to glut their
brutal passions, feeling sure of exemption
from punishment, because
reason that public opinion will sustain they
them. In North Carolina last fall so-
called ministers of the gospel were
found not only sanctioning but helping
in the outrages perpetrated on the colored
people, and one well- known minister
wrote a letter to the New York Independent
justifying the lawless course
of the whites and the shooting of
ored men. col-

The lynching of a Colored citizen in
Georgia this week for defending himself
against a white man, and the brutal
whipping of his whole family and driving
them permanently form their home
is just a passing incident not to be mentioned
according to Mr. Booker T.
Washington's dictum, which if followed
would turn the whole race into a drove
cowards well deserving to be lynch-

local resident. was arrested and
charged with the attack of a wom-

Chlef of Police J. E Matthews in
spite of the fact that threats of
lynching had been made openly.
After the arrest was made there
was little or no empt to afford
the arrested you any protection.
The assaultâ€œth the jail was a
farce with polic, officers making
no attempt to thwart the lynch-
Ing. Although a w of the mob
members made some attempt to
conceal their identity the entire
town more or less openly partiel-
pated in the affair and the ident-
ity of the lynchers is well known.
The scene of the actual lynch-
ing was about four miles from
town on the Liberty Hill rond and
almost immediately after it WAS
certain that the youth had been
killed the chief of police went
through the motions of leading
searching party to the scene of the
murder.
Calloway was killed by bullet
wounds in the head and arm and
his body was badly mutilated in
the bargain. Authorities here an-
nounced that they would conduct
an Investigation into the lynching
but those in the know inslated that
no action would be taken against
those responsible despite the fact
that they are known.

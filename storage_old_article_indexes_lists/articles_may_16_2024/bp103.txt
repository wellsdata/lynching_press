Racism sent a letter to Ford CEO
Alexander Trotman complaining
about that auto manufacturer's foot
dragging on discrimination suits
filed in 1993 and 1995. These law-
suits include a class-action suit
against Ford Motor Credit Co. filed
by black employees and ex-
employees.
"It is Ford's failure to drive sys-
temic and structural changes in
your corporate culture that is the
root cause of your problems,"
stated the Coalition's letter. This
letter criticized Ford claims that the
lawsuit plaintiffs are just poor per-
formers who have mental and/or
emotional defects.
The effectiveness of hate crimes
laws and equal opportunity corpo-
rate policies comes not from their
mere existence but their vigorous
enforcement.
Political and corporate leaders
are derelict in enforcing anti-dis-
crimination measures.
"Should not a nation be just to
all of her citizens." George White
asked during that 1900 congres-
sional address.
The answer is yes. The question
remains: when will America insure
justice for all?

seeking to dismantle post-Civil
Rights era black political and eco-

The corporate lynching of
Charles Bell, the first black GM
dealer in Alabama, whose success
lead to sabotaging of his business,
was presented last week in the Wall
Street Journal. The deceptive and
discriminatory business practices
GM allegedly executed against Bell
lead to a $17 million jury ver:!ict,
an award that GM succeeded in
reversing on appeal.
Bell's supporters claim GM's
"litigation truck has dragged him"
through seven years of legal battles.
`Dragging' Bell, supporters say,
seeks in part to intimidate other
black GM dealers who are experi-
encing problems similar to what
drove Bell out of business.
Sixty-eight years before the
recent racist murder in Jasper, a
posse in Honey Grove, Texas,
dragged the body of George John-
son through that town by an auto-
mobile before burning the mangled
corpse in front of a black church.
Last month, the Philadelphia
based Coalition Against Corporate
of contemporary
hate crimes is the
legacy of white supremacy inclu-
sive of lynchings.
Lynchings were not an aberrant
outburst of mass racist behavior.
Lynchings were an integral
weapon in the onslaught to keep
blacks politically, economically
and socially suppressed.
Lynch mobs frequently targeted
black businesses for destruction.
When a mob lynched George
Hughes in Sherman, Texas, on May
9, 1930, it also burned that town's
entire black business section to the
ground.
Destroying black businesses
destabilized black economic
empowerment.
The intimidation of lynchings
contributed to the continued eco-
nomic exploitation of blacks and
their political disenfranchisement.
Deliberately deprived of eco-
nomic and political power, blacks
in the Jim Crow era could not
mount effective actions to stop the
physical violence of lawless mobs
or the psychic violence of legal
lynching in the public and private
sectors.
Today, sophisticated legal
lynchings have replaced rampaging
lynch mobs. Contemporary institu-
tional racism reduces the need for
overt acts of redneck racism.
Today, legal lynchings openly
occur in legislative chambers and
corporate boardrooms.
The Judiciary Committee's
trashing of Philadelphia Common
Pleas Court Judge Frederica Mas-
to indict members of the mob.
The lynch-like murder of a black
man in Jasper, Texas, a few weeks
ago resurrected the ugly legacy of
America's ultimate hate crime.
Tomorrow, the U.S. Senate Judi-
ciary Committee is scheduled to
begin hearings on a Hate Crimes
Prevention Act.
If the widespread condemna-
tions of the Jasper murder are more
that mere rhetoric, the Judiciary
committee and the full Senate will
approve this measure toughening
federal penalties for racially moti-
vated violence that is escalating
across the nation.
However, simply passing this
act is not enough.
This law by itself will have little
effect on the insidious atmosphere
spawning racially motivated vio-
lence, an atmosphere aggravated by
widespread assaults on civil rights
that involve many member of the
Judiciary Committee.

"Even here in the House and the
Senate," White stressed, "senators
and representatives have under-
taken the unholy task of excusing
these foul deeds, and in some
instances, they have gone so far as
to justify them..."
White fought a valiant yet
unsuccessful battle to have
congress adopt anti-lynching legis-
lation.
White's proposed legislation
never came to a vote.
Congress repeatedly refused to
adopt any anti-lynching legislation
despite the pervasiveness of lynch-
ing and continuous efforts by black
organizations to have the heinous
activity outlawed.

on Jail

two men in the public
thoroughfares.
White Man Killed
The trouble started when two men
were arrested and placed in the city
Jall charged with the murder of a
white man with whom they had been
gambling. The entire city, in the white
districts, sought revengo, but the may-
or and police wero successful in dis-
persing the crows that gathered to do
the prisoners harm.
Prisoners Lynched
However, on a rainy night, when no
one was expecting a lynching to occur,
a white man, an agent of the insurance
company, and friend of the deceased.
led a small band of men to the jail
and demanded the prisoners at the point
of guns.
The two men were dragged
through the streets and cut to pieces
by bullets and left for the public to
view.
Race Organizes
Incensed beyond all measure, 16.000.
people withdrew from the company and
put to fight insurance agents when
they called to collect money. Loss of.
thousands of dollars faced the com-
pany, and the mayor was, induced to
speak to the withdrawing members,
but to no avail. Leading men of our
Race assembled and took advantage of
the opportunity to organize the Peo-
plo's Industrial Insurance company, and
took over all the business lost by the
white company.

PARDON BOARD IS RESPONSIBLE
FOR LYNCHING
Grangeville.- Judge Edgar C.
Steele, of the district bench, now
holding cou.t here, tonight made
public a letter to Governor Hawley
in which he places the blame for the
lynching of Peter Mallick upon the
state board of pardons, which he intimated
is actuated solely by sentiment
and not by the merits of the
case in the granting of commutations,
pardons and paroles and that tiring
of the board undoing the work of
the courts, some of the citizens of
Idaho county, whom Judge Steele as-
serts are as law- abiding and law- enforcing
as there are any place, took
it upon themselves to administer
justice in a manner they knew the
pardon board could not interfere
with. He also assured the governor
that a grand jury would be called.
The letter in part says
Will Call Grand: Jury

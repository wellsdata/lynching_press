CHANGING ATTITUDE ATTITUDE
There may be an element of perverted conscience in
the white man's violent anxiety to protect female purity.
His own crimes against colored women may have given
him an unholy sensitiveness. During slavery the colored
girl was defenceless in the presence of her white master
and his friends, and even in our doy the Negro girl is all
but helpless before the advances of white men the more
primitive plantations and villages. The shooting of a
white man, who was forcing his way into a colored home
in Tennessee, led to the lynching of the Negro who had
been defending himself and his wife. Even in New York
the race riots of 1900 started by the killing of a white man
from whom a Negro was attempting to rescue his wife.
On the other hand, within recent months in New Orleans
a white man was convicted and punished for attacking a
colored girl. The attention which this conviction received
in the southern press indicates how unusual the outcome
was and suggests an encouraging change of attitude.

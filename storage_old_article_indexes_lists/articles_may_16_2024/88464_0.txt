THEY APOLOGIZED
From the New Orleans States.
The other day an Alabama mob lynch√©d
the wrong man and they" deeply regret
it."
They might do as a Texas mob once did.
They hung a man for stealing a mustang
and shortly after learned that he was innocent
. After debating the question they
decided that the captain should call on the
widow and apologize. Riding up to the
fence, he called her to the door and explained
the mistake had been made,
closing thus:" Madame that, the joke's on us."

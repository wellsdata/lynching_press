The defense of mob aut 1 in the
South is that "it is the only way
to protect our women:
No person quarrels with mnenfoli
trying to protect their women. A
question does arise as to whether
It is a white man's right to take
a black man away from the law
and lynch him. It is unsely that

No, it is just low grade mob rule

And is the attacking c womer
always done by blacks pon the
whites? Do whites never attack
black girls? And if they do. are
they-lynched? Or is it that black
girls are fair game for attack?

"HAYNES FOR MUNICIPAL
JUDGET.
(From The Chicago Tribuzė)
"One of the candidates for fudzu
of the Municipal court may be
supposed to suffer a special but us
deserved handicap. He is Wiliam
H. Haynes, a colored man Soma
white voters may not consider his
qualifications because of his race.
We think it additional reason for
his election in view of his personal
apd professional qualifications. We
have learned from men who havą
worked with, Mr. Haynes and in
whose judgment we have confidence
that he is; capable, honest, and an
excellent lawyer... Mr. Loesch, unde!
whom he served in the grand jury
investigations and prosecutions of
1928, favors his election on the i
portant grounds that he has the
background of culture, education
and experience as well as the mind
which would make him an adzir
able judge..
We to not think that race or
nationalist consideratigde ought to
control the judgment of the vote
in the selection of officials, espe
cially judicial officers. But the ru
works both ways. The are prae
tical reasons why in view of ow
largo colored population colore:
man otherwise qualified, shock
have place in our judiciary. Ba
there are considerations of th
higher expediency which plead to
it Americans of colored race con
stitute a large part of our populi
tion. They are among the most loy
al of our clizenry. For them
America is home. Common sense a
well as hyman feeling and publ
policy, should keep open the doo
of opportunity to honorable effor
and reasonable, ambition.”

A HORRIBLE RECORD.
On the 16th of last month, says the
Chicago Record, five negroes were
lynched at Palmetto, Ga., charged with
arson. On the 23rd of March, seven
negroes were lynched in Little River
county, Arkansas, charged with murder
, though in reality but one of them
concerned in the crime. On the
was
same day three negroes were lynched
in Silver City, Miss., who had been
participants in a race encounter, the
cause of which is not known at present
. Since the first of January last
there have been twenty- four cases of
lynching reported. Every one of the
victims was a negro. Every case occurred
in the. This is an awful
record of mob south murder.

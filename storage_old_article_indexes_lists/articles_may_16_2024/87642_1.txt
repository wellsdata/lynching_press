Washington Was Hustled Out of Town Refere
a Mob Could Assemble.
BIRMINGHAM, Ala., July 23.- To avoid a lynching
at Talladega, Ala., George Washington, 17
years old, a negro, was brought here to- night by
Deputy Sheriff Lide of that place.
Washington is charged with making an at
tempt this morning to assault Mrs. Estelle
Miles of that place. Washington has confessed
to having entered the house, but says he did not
go there to commit an assault.
At 1 o'clock this morning Washington gained
entrance through a window with a wire. He
went into Mrs. Miles's room. She awoke at the
moment and gave an alarm. The negro attempted
to choke her, but fled upon seeing that
aid was coming. Dogs were put upon his trail
and he was caught.
It was evident that a lynching was to take
place and the deputy slipped him out a back
way, boarded a freight train and came to Bir-
mingham. The negro has praying ever
since his capture. been

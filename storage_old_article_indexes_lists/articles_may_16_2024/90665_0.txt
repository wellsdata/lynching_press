The Fire at Wilmington,
Del., Still Smoldering.
THE BURNING OF WHITE
His Colored Countrymen Inclined to
Make Trouble and the Police Are
Kept on the Move.
Wilmington, Del., June 25.- A riot
broke out on the streets here late tonight
between the whites and negroes
which for a time assumed serious proportions
. The arrival of a squad of
police, however, quickly dispersed the
participants. Two arrests were made.
A large gang of negroes numbering
probably 200 who had been marching-
up and down Ninth street were challenged
by about twenty- five white
men and in the battle that followed
over a hurdred shots were fired.
A squad of police under Captain.
Evans, and Sergeant McDermott
rushed to the scene and charged upon
the mob. The negroes and whites
scattered and fled in all directions, but
the police succeeded in capturing two
of the negroes, Leander Moore and
Joseph Shockley. The policemen used
their clubs freely and in the melee attendant
upon the arrests Sergeant Me-
Dermott and Patrolman Green received
slight wounds. One negro, James
Mercer, was shot in the head during
the riot but his wound is not believed
to be serious.
In a brawl in another part of the
city, William Cramer, a negro, was
shot in the stomach by a white man.
He was taken to a hospital in a serious
condition.
The leaders of the party of negroes
who were marching on Ninth street tonight
declared that they intend to resent
the attacks made upon members
of their race last night. They say they
have been badly abused and that they
did not intend to quietly submit to
such abuse.
They say they have no sympathy for
White, the negro who was lynched, but
that on the contrary most of their race
in about Wilmington approve of
his and lynching.

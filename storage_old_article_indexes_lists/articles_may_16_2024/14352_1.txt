MISSOURI MOB WREAKS ITS
TERRIBLE REVENGE
Demolish Jall, Take Two Colored
Youths Suspected of Assault,
Hang and Roast Them
in Public
By Associated Press
SPRINGFIELD, Mo., April 14.- A
mob tonight took two negroes from the
county jail here and hanged them to
the electric tower in the center of the
public square and built a fire under
the men as they hung. The negroes
were Horace Duncan and James Cope-
land, both under 21 years of age. They
were in jail charged with assaulting
Mabel Edmondson, a white girl, last
night. Fully 5000 people went to the
county jail about 9 o'clock and with
telephone poles and sledge hammers
literally tore the jail to pieces. Finally
the two negro suspects were dragged
from the place and taken to the center
of the public square and hanged.
It is fully a mile from the jail to the
square, and the mob marched down
one of the principal streets of the
town, shouting and firing pistols.
Mabel Edmondson came here recent-
from Monett, Mo., to obtain employment
as a domestic servant. Last night
she was riding in a buggy with
Charles Cooper, a young man of
Springfield. In a secluded part of the
city the couple were held up by two
negroes. The man was knocked unconscious
and the girl dragged from
the buggy and into the woods by the
roadside and assaulted.
The two negroes lynched tonight
suspected and arrested, but were
were only partially identified.

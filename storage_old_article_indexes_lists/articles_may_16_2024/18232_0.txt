In this way, the bosses try to cover
up their brutal murder of this Negro
worker. But their lies will not deceive
the working class. Edwards
was most likely killed by the deputy
sheriff acting as a member of the
boss lynch gang of five. This ex
plains how the gang got the combination
to the door of the cell in
which he was confined.
The lynch murder of this young
worker sends the total of known and
admitted lynchings to 107 for the
present year. This does not include
the numerous unreported lynchings,
nor the legal lynchings through the
bosses courts.
Negro and white workers! Smash
the lynching terror! Organize self
defense corps of white and Negro
workers! Demand the right of Ne-
gro workers to bear arms for self-
defense! Stop the disarming of the
Negro masses! Answer the lynchers
with mass defense of the Negro work-
ers and with a mass fight for the
right of the Negro majorities in the
Black Belt determine and control
their own form to of government!

National Anti- Mob and Lynch Club Association
of Ohio Writes Governor
Jones to Prevent Lynching
of Arrests.
Little Rock, Ark., August 25.- The crusade
against idle negroes, which began
shortly after the atrocious assaults committed
on white women in this city last
week, is being pushed vigorously. Of the
fifty negroes jailed as suspects, a large
number have been sentenced to jail for sixty
days on bread and water on the
vagrancy charge.
The bread and water sentences are given
under authority of an old law that had not
been invoked in many years. Large numbers
of negroes have fled from Little Rock
to escape arrest. Three who have been
identified as those who assaulted white
women have been removed to another
county to avoid possible lynchings. Officers
are still searching for the other two
culprits and are arresting every idle negro
they find on a charge of vagrancy.
Govenor Jones received a letter from the
National Anti- Mob and Lynch Club association
, of Springfield, O., requesting him
" in the name of humanity, law and order
prevent the lynching of those forty men
to in Little Rock."

Dr. Frank of Monroe Parish,
La., is accused of being a leader
in the mob that lynched a white
man there a few weeks ago, and
the authorities
are offering$ 1000
for the arrest aud conviction of
the leaders. The widow of the
mobbed has also instituted suit
against the railroad over which
the train ran that bore the mob,
for$ 100,000. You can't lynch
white people and have the coroner's
jury just say:" The deceased
came to his death at the
hands of unknown parties," nor
the" best citizens were infuriated
and were masked," etc..

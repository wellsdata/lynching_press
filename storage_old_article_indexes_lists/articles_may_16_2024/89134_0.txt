Montgomery, September 17 .--( Special.)-
Governor Jelks said this afternoon that
neither the citizens nor the officiers of
Gadsden had called upon him for aid in
the attempt to indict members of the
mob which lynched Bunk Richardson, a
negro, there some months ago. He further
said that if aid was required he
would grant it in every way possible,
though of course, he would not go there.
That was the business of the courts.
It will be remembered that just after
the lynching the governor sent George
Bodeker, a detective of Birmingham, to
Gadsden and the latter made a report,
which was furnished the officers of the
county. The governor said that he understood
that the grand jury now in session
is a very strong one, and he hopes
that it will indict the" murderers" of
Richardson and bring them to justice.
Some believe, the governor points out,
that the offenders in this connection are
known to the people of Gadsden.
This case is one in which the governor
The
has taken the greatest interest.
lynching followed closely after the commutation
of one of the alleged assaulters
of Mrs. Jane Smith, a white woman murdered
near Gadsden, and is supposed to
have been revenge for such executive
clemency. in

BUTTE, Mont., Jan. 26.- An Inter- Moun-
tain special from Virginia City says:
Word was received here this afternoon
that John Wolff, who murdered Sheriff
Summers near Ennis yesterday, had been
captured in the Upper Madison Valley by
one of the posses which started in search
of him. The capture was effected after
an exciting chase of many miles. The
posse comprised about fifty of the most
prominent residents of Madison County.
Not since the days of the vigilantes has
there been such excitement in old Alder
Gulch. There is a strong feeling here in
favor of the lynching of Wolff. Unless
calmer counsel prevalis the friends of
Summers will take the law into their
own
hands. At 4:30 this afternon a large body
of men started out to meet the posse
murderer. and

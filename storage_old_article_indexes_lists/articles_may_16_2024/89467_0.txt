The newspapers of the north and middle west have nothing to be proud
about in their connection with the Leo Frank lynching. The Frank case long
ago was taken from the courts and the state of Georgia and tried in the news-
papers. We are not interested in whether or not Frank was guilty or not guilty
of the crime with which he was charged. Neither is there any possibility of condoning
the frightful crime of lynching. But we deplore the attitude of the
newspapers which railed against the south until their interference fanned the
flames of mob- hatred and resulted in the Frank lynching. One of the principle
papers in Chicago became, thus, the head of the mob that lynched Frank and
equally guilty of the crime. Every sane man looks with horrer on the deed of
the Georgia mob, and none deplores it so much as the people of Georgia. We
find our quarrel with the incendiary newspapers on the principle that two
wrongs do not make a right Editorials in newspapers have their mission to
ill, but it is not part of that. mission to lead and inflame mobs.

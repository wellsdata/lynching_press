It is said a number of prominent citi-
zens of Ottumwa have declared it their
intention to prosecute the leaders of
the mob which lynched the man
Johnson recently. They declare that
although the man probably deserved
his fate, the men who lynched him are
not such blameless characters as to
take the law in their own hands. The
leaders are Russian Jews, and they
will have abundance of money to de.
themselves. The grand jury will
fend be compelled to act.

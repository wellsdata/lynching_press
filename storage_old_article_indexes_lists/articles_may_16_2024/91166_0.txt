Under the head of" Attempt to murder and Lynch law,"
the Houston Telegraph gives a long account of a circumstance
which recently occured in Colorado county. On the
night of the 27th ult., a gentleman named Alexander Area,
while on his way to Austin was set upon and nearly murdered
by one Jean Baptiste Russell, described as a mixed
blooded Louisianian. Area escaped, make affidavit of the
facts before the justice of the peace, aud Russell was recognized
and arrested. The trial was delayed at the request
of Mr. A., who expressed himself anxious about his
saddle bags, which contained some papers of considerable
value to him. The populace of the town, informing themselves
fully of the circumstances, of the attempt to murder
and to rob, from the witnesses, and partly from the confessions
of the prisoner, and knowing his pervious villainous
conduct and character, became so incensed at the
enormity of the crime, that they took him out of the pos.
session of the guard, from thence to the bottom, and it is
said he was there hanged. Their reason for this
and illegal proceeding is, that they have no jail. arbitary

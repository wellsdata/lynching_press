ARKANSAS BELLE KILLED.
Shot by Father of the Girl She Was
Assisting in Serenading.
LITTLE ROCK, Ark., June 10.- Miss
Leona Goodman, one of the most popular
society belles of Dardanelle, was killed in
a most shocking manner at Rover, Ark.,
last night. The Yell county normal is being
held at that place and a large number of
teachers are in attendance. Last night a
party of young women and men were out
serenading and went to a house where a
young teacher named Lipp was stopping.
When awakened by the serenaders Lipp deliberately
fired a pistol shot into the serenading
party. The bullet struck Miss Goodman
in the neck, causing instant death,
The murderer was arrested and spirited
away to Danville by the officers who feared
that an attempt would be made by the
cited people to lynch him. ex-

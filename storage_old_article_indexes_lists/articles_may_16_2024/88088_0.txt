Jealousy.
-
New York, July 21.- Only by drawing
their revolvers and threatening to
shoot to kill did several Brooklyn police
prevent a mob from wreaking
vengeance on Frederick Kriselmeyer
after he had shot his wife and his
stepdaughter. Up to the doors of the
Hamburg Avenue police station, the
clamoring mob went crying" lynch
him," and it was necessary to call out
the reserves. Kriselmeyer was SO
badly beaten before the policemen res
him that it was necessary to call
cued an ambulance.

A Desperado Lynched.
KANSAS CITY, July 19.- A brief dispatch
states that Neal Thornton, a desperado who
murdered Daniel Sheehan, a policeman, at Jop-
lin, Mo., yesterday, was lynched there this
morning. Thornton was a very bad character,
and shot Sheehan while the latter was trying to
arrest him for an old offense.
The murderer, Thornton, was placed in the
town calaboose last night, under guard. A 2
o'clock this morning a mob forced the doors
and, securing the prisoner, carried him a short
distance and strung him up in a grove of maple
. The coroner's jury states that the
trees lynchers were unknown.

" I am confident that the workers
of this country, while organizing
against wage- cuts and for unemployment
insurance, will strengthen the
fight against the Hoover- Doak- A. F.
of L. policy to divide the workers
into native, foreign- born and Ne
groes and terrorize them with jail
ings, deportations and lynchings. I
am confident that the workers will
increase their activities for my re
lease, the release of Mooney, the
Scotsboro boys and all other class
war prisoners.-

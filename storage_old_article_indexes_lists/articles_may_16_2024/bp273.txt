Negroes sit in theatres beside white
people and in the North there are

all of which are absent from the

To the superficial North-
ern white mind the Negro seems
to be fairly treated, although at
least 40 per cent of his rights are
withheld. This 62 per cent of
Northern opinion also spells danger
for the Nation, in any case, 'hough.
MY REASON for saying that is.
this The great salvation of the
Negro in the South for the past
three centuries has aroused
public opinion in the North. It
brought the end of slavery. Most
of the great opposers of injustice
to Negroes were, and are, from thel
North. Without them, the night of
Southern babarity would soon close
down on the Negro in the South.}*
Of course, the North is prodded,
too, by outside world opinion, be

cre, world opinion blames not the

THE NEWS report of the NOR
poll did not say what percentage
of Southern whites thought Ne-
groes were being treated unfairly.
It did say that this was higher
among those who had attended col-
lege. But here again the important
thing is not what people feel about
vil conditions, but what they do
about them.
In this respect I cite a poll given
by Dr. S. Samuelson in the Jour-
nal of Social Issues and mention-]
ed by Lawrence Gould. According
to this poll, 2.523 white students

is evident. Formal education af-
fects the "brain," not the "heart."}
It takes ethical training to do the
latter.' An educated man can be
just as hard-hearted as an unedu-
cated one. Lester F. Ward once;
said. "Scratch a savant and you'll}
find a savage." How readily many

The NOR poll also gave 62 per
cent of Northern whites as saying
Negroes were fairly treated. Aguin

ANOTHER INVESTIGATION.
Governor Will Order One Under the
Attorney General.
Governor Mount gave out the following
statement last night when questioned concerning
the report that the Ripley county
jury had failed to indict any of the lynchers
:-
" I have not yet been officially informed
of the alleged failure of Ripley county
grand jury to return indictments against
persons engaged in the recent lynching at
Versailles. I have wired the prosecuting
attorney for particulars. If it appears that
no indictments have been found I shall immediately
order another investigation under
the direction of a fearless attorney general,
assisted by the ablest counsel procurable,
reinforced by all the resources at the command
of the executive. I am no less determined
now than at the beginning to
vigorously all available means for
bringing the use offenders to justice."

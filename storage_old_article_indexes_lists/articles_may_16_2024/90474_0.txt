JACKSONVILLE, Fla., March 8.-
Three companies of state militia are
being held under arms in their barracks
today because of bitter feeling
which has followed the attempt of a
mob to lynch five negroes nast night.
The mob dispersed when the fire department
turned several streams of
water on it.
The five negroes are
under arrest charged with murdering
S. Silverstein and then attacking Mrs.
Silverstein and two children Sunday.
Led by a woman, a mob of several
hundred people attempted to storm
the jail last night. The woman defied
the police who had drawn their
revolvers to shoot her. With an axe
she attacked the door of the jail, but
was overpowered and placed in a cell.
In the meantime all the municipal
and county police had been rushed to
the scent and the fire department was
called out.
A fireman who refused to
turn on the water against the mob was
discharged on the spot and fire chief
Haney himself took charge the fire
plug. of

There have been several lynching operations in differ"
ent parts of the state. Two men were arrested in this
city, about ten days ago, on suspicion of having robbed
Mr. Jansen, a merchant. The accused were from
Sidney, and were recognized as convicts from the Bri-
tish penal colonies. The organization of the immigrant
convicts is so complete, that it is almost impossible
to obtain a conviction, and the citizens have for a long
time been convinced that the courts were but abettors
of the rascality carried on by these knaves The citi-
.
zens, to the number of perhaps ten thousand, met in
front of the court house, and having assigned the prisoners
counsel, they proceeded to a trial, and heard evidence
for and against the accused. Three judges were
chosen by the people, and the jurors were selected in
like manner. After hearing the testimony the jury stood
nine for conviction and three for acquittal, and the prisoners
were handed over to the law.
Charles Duane, alias Dutch Charley, who had shot
a Frenchman a few days previously, and had been admitted
to bail, fearing that the multitude would take
vengeance upon him, took refuge in the sta-
summary tion house.

Governor Deneen in the United
States Senate will do all in his power
to strike down lawlessness, crime,
criminality, mob violence and lynching
. He will put his feet down on it
and do it hard. We need a man in
the Senate whose heart is in the right
place, if not on the right side. I am
going to take a few speaking lessons,
and then I am going to speak for
Governor Deneen to go to the Senate.
But I am not in politics now, and
will excuse me for what I have
you said.

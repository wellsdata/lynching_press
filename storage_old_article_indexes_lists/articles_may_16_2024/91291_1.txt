-Some weeks ago a man named Mara-
ble, living on the Marfreesboro Pike, accompanied
by four men, disguised as Ku-
Klux, went to the house of a negro near
by and committed several outrages. A
day or two afterward Marable was found
hanging to a tree, with a paper on him
telling all others to take warning by his
fate how they use the name and
of the Ka- Klux Klan for evil purposes disguise.

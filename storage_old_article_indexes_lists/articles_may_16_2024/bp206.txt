Over A Month
VIENNA, Ga.
(SNS)
While
the law was being forced to take its
course in one Georgia lynching in
Toombs County about 100 miles
from here, the mysterious slaying
of another Negro was being belated-
ly revealed as reports
as reports told of a
bound and gagged victim being fish-
-
r
ed out of nearby Flint River about
a month ago.
The news was finally released to
the press by Detective Gordon
Stokes, of the Albany Police depart
ment, whose efforts finally succeed-
ed in establishing the identity of
the victim who was shot through
the heart, his body being bound and
gagged, weighted down with a heavy
stone and dumped into the muddy
waters of Flint River.
BURIED IN ADJOINING COUNTY
Detective Stokes said the victim
was identified as Charles James
Davis through a Social Security
card reportedly found on his person
by Sheriff A. D. Peavey of Dooly
County. Although Davis' residence
was listed as Pecan City, in Dough-
erty County, the scene of the dis
covery of his body near Vienna was
approximately 50 miles away. The
mystery became further shrouded
when Dooly County Sheriff Peavey
for some unknown reason turned
the decomposed body over to an un-
dertaker in Cordele, the seat of the
adjoining county, Crisp, it was said.
Reports claim that a Dooly County
coroner's verdict found that Davis
came to his death at the hands of
a party, or parties unknown. What
investigation, if any, was made was
undisclosed.

Detective Stokes said the body
| was buried in Crisp County and, in
all probability, will be exhumed for
reburial in Albany at the request of
relatives there. If, and when, the
body is returned to Albany, Detec-
tive Stokes said a probe will be
made for the fatal bullet for ballis-
tic. examination.
The relatives could cite no pos-
sible reason for the slaying, Detec-
tive Stokes related. They said that
the deceased did travel frequently
however, the detective related.
Dooly county is the home county
of the senior U. S.Senator from
Georgia, Walter F. George.

And thus the weary pilgrim, fleeing from
despotism, hungering and thirsting for
freedom, who, allured by the flaming sign of
Democracy, there asks for the generous sentiments
, the liberal principles, the equality
of individual right, for State Kights, self
government, and freedom of speech and press.
is now told, we have none here. Well,
what have you! Why, we have Democracy
. Very good give me some of the
principles of Jefferson. Principles of Jet-
ferson! We have just driven Underwood
from his home, with threat of lynch law, for

don't we tell you, we have Democracy
Well, then, give me some of the doctrines of
Jackson- his proclamation was rather

Hickory, we did have some of his bark, and

biting' em, it somehow annoyed our Southern
nullifying friends, we threw it away, and wo
havn't got a relic of him left. In the name
of heaven, then, tell me what you have got.

or be fined a hundred dollars.
Democracy
Democracy! Democracy and if any man
circulates a paper insinuating that all men
are free and equal,' we shall chain him to an
iron ball, and make him work five years on
the highways, under a pro- slavery driver.
Democracy and if any man aids a slave to
gain his freedom, we'll hang him, Democracy!

made up his mind that he must go further to
any Democracy which either himself or
find his horse can swallow.

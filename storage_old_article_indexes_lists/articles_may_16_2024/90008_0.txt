A Negro Ravisher Lynched for an At.
tempted Rape.
XENIA, Ohio, June 13.- At Jamestown,
this county, on Saturday night at about
midnight, Peter Betters, a colored man,
made a desperate attempt at murder and
rape upon an old colored lady, Martha
Thomas, aged nearly seventy- five years.
He gained entrance to her log cabin by
digging a trench from the outside and coming
up from the hole into the room in
which the old lady was sleeping. A most
desperate struggle ensued, in which the
old lady was terribly mangled, and was unconscious
when found. The alarm was
given and the assailant arrested, but broke
through the guard and escaped. The
neighborhood was greatly excited over the
affair, and the fugitive negro hunted down.
In the fair grounds, where the cyclone
played such fearful havoc some time ago,
are many trees bent by the storm and
making excellent gallows. To one of
these the body of Betters was found hanging
this( Monday) morning, cold and dead.
Whether hung by the mob or by his own
hand, can not be determined at this time,
but it is generally believed that the work
was quietly done by the infuriated citizens
of Jamestown in the dead hour of night,
and strict secrecy sworn on the spot
the avengers. by

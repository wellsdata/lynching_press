Bessemer, January 28 .-( Special.).
Friends of Joseph Gagliano, a prominent
Italian who was foully murdered
Friday night, frenzied at the sight of
the handcuffed negro suspected of hav-
ing committed the crime, leaped from
the ranks of the funeral procession this
afternoon and shot John Chandler to
death.
The negro fell with his weight to the
ground, and while Deputy Parker was
endeavoring to prevent the rescue of
the man believed to have killed his prisoner
, other Ttalians fired a score of
shots into the negro's prostrate body.
With gore dripping from 20 wounds, the
corpse was carried to an undertaking
establishment. Louis Gagliano, brother
arrested,
dead Italian, was
of the
charged with murder.
City Detective, Ross, from a stray bullet
which in a flattened shape rebounded
from the pavement, received
a flesh wound in the right leg.
City's Most Sensational Affair
It was the most sensational occurrence
in the history of this city. For
half an hour the most prominent corner
of Bessemer was the scene of wildest
excitement. Women shrieked shrilly in
& strange tongue. Possibly for the preservation
of life, desperate men struggled
. From every section citizens,
aroused by the sound of shot, came running
. Under the feet of the veritable
mob, its blood dyeing crimson the pavement
, was the body. of Chandler about
whose wrists the law had clamped its
chain. In prominent view all the while
was the coffin. containing the remains
of the dead Italian of its vengeance for
whose death the law had just been
deprived.
When peace was restored, the funeral
procession moved onward. Wita
their own peculiar rites, the Italians
in the earth the ashes of
Gagliano deposited.
Held Three Prisoners
During the morning Coroner Brasher
investigated the death of Gagliano, and
the three negroes held for the crime, John
Forney Smith Charles
and

Chandler, and Deputy Herron, in charge
of Smith and Paige, were awaiting the
arrival of a car. As the car reached the

" Just at that moment I found myself in
the clutch of half a dozen men, each of

my assistance, and I was able to hold my
man. He was Louis Gagliano, the brother
of Joseph Gagliano whose funeral the

to headquarters."
Takes Pistol From Gagliano
From the hand of Gagliano Deputy
Parker states that he took a Smith&

Ross, states that the man denies that he

as
Sheriff McAdory and Chief Deputy Met-
calfe reached Bessemer from Birmingham
ebout 5 o'clock, and after making a su-
investigation, returned with
perficial
Cagliano to the county jail. Deputy
Chew was left in charge with instructions
to arrest every man suspected of
having participated in the shooting of
Chandler.
The prisoner, as he sat in the office of
the Bessemer deputies, presented a picture
of abject fear. He is a small man
with a peculiarly thin face and attenuated
neck. He said nothing, but his fingers
aved between each other rapidly as if
under the pressure of nervousness, and
large eyes roamed without seeing
his along the blackened walls.
Excitement All Over City
Following the funeral of Joseph Gag-
liano, the Italians returned to Bessemer,
and might have been seen in earnest conversation
about the corners of the city.
They were evidently discussing the shooting
of the negro Chandler, and possibly
awaiting, not without fearful anticipation,
the action of the law.
Throughout Besserier excitement
reigned for hours. Practically the entire
male population was on the scene of the
crime. Men talked in low tones everywhere
. A string of curious filed through
the doorway of Jacobs' undertaking establishment
. A thousand men, it is probable
, gazed upon the bloody, mangled face
of Chandler, and beheld the gaping pistol
wounds still open on his breast.
At 7 o'clock the church bells rang and
the thought pierced home that the day
had been Sunday. It was a nasty night
with a blustering rain. But the coagulated
gore of Chandler still reflected deep red
from the pavement.
Crime Was Brutal
Joseph Gagliano was shot, brutally shot,
without cause Friday night. He conduct-
ed a grocery store on Carolina avenue.
He was a pod man, it is said, and was
highly regarded by the people of Besse-
mer.
On the night of the murder a negro en-
tered his store and made a small purchase
. Gaglano reminded him as he was
returning to the door that he had not
paid the amoint due. The negro, it is said,
aimed a revover at his heart and fired.
Officers soo afterward arrested Chandler
, Smith aid Paige, and it is stated
that the evidence indicated thefirst named
as the culprit Peculiar is de fact that
, not long since, ws employed
Chandler y the city as a guard of cavicts.

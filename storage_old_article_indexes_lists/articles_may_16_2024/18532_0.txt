PUSH OFF THE EARTH
Given a Murderer at Hilltop, Mary
land, by a Mob of Lynchers.
Baltimore, June 27.- Joseph Cocking
of Hilltop, Charles county, Md., who
was awaiting trial on a charge of murdering
his wife and sister, Miss Daisy
Miller, on the night of April 23, was
taken from the old jail at Port Tobacco
last night and lynched by a crowd
of about 25 men.
Cocking was brought to Baltimore
April 23 in order to escape the vengeance
of the mob, and was returned
to the Charles county authorities May
21, as his trial had been set for the
day following. His counsel asked for
a two weeks' extension of time, which
was refused, and upon the usual affidavits
the case was removed to an ad
joining county and would have come
up for trial in September. The plan
for lynching was hatched at a ball
game which took place at Hilltop, the
scene of the murder, yesterday after
noon. The lynching party met shortly
before midnight. All wore masks
and about 15 wore women's dresses.
They awoke an old colored man, Wash
ington Burch, who had charge of the
jail. He made some show of resistance
but finally delivered over the keys.
Cocking, who had been aroused by
the noise, was taken from the jail to a
bridge 200 yards away, where a rope
with a noose was placed around his
neck and he was told to confess, but
he said that he was innocent. Then he
was directed to pray, but said he did
not want to pray.
The rope was then made fast to the
rail of the bridge and the murderer
was lifted to the rail and pushed off.
He fell ten feet. The party then dispersed
, leaving the body dangling with
the feet just reaching the water,
neath the bridge. be

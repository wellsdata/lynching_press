-A dispatch from Las Vegas, N. M., says
that" four rustlers, who bound and gagged
Mason, a store- keeper, near Mosilla recently,
robbing his store of all they couid carry, were
overtaken by a Mexican posse and strangled.
All were Americans, but their names are unknown
. They belonged to a gang of
cowboys and richly deserved their fate." Arizona

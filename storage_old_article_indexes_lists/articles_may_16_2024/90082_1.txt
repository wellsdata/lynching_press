President Asked to Place California's
' Judicial Lynching' of Labor Leaders
Before Wickersham Commission.
NEW DELAY MENACES PARDON HOPE
Newspaper Executives Pledge Aid in
Unemployment Crisis, Call for Repeal
of Eighteenth Amendment.
By Scripps- Howard Newspaper Alliance
FRENCH LICK SPRINGS, Ind., Oct. 18.- President
Hoover today was called upon by the twenty- five Scripps-
Howard newspapers represented in editorial conference here
to intervene in the Mooney- Billings case.
Characterizing as" judicial lynching" the course of Cal-
ifornia courts thus far in connection with the case, the editors
urged the President, by resolution, to place the celebrated
case before the Wickersham commission for review and possible
public action. A copy of the resolution was telegraphed
the President.
The resolution was inspired by news dispatches from
San Francisco stating that there was a definite possibility
of prolonged delay in the report of the California supreme
court on the recently heard pardon appeal of Warren K. Billings
and Thomas J. Mooney jointly convicted of the Preparedness
day bomb outrage, in July, 1916.

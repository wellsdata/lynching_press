PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Dec. 24-In my initial article in
The Courier in September I predicted that a wave of race hate
would invadę the northern states this winter. Events during
the last two or three weeks show that the sinister shadows
begin to gather. Judge Lynch has come over into the border
states and holds court almost in the very shadow of the Cap-
itol at Washington.
It has beend
twenty years since a lynching in
Maryland. A few days ago a mob
lynched and burned a Negro in that
state. Last week the moblynched
two Negroes in West Virginia...
Who knows where the next out-
break will be? The hoodlum cle-
ment is nervous and hungry and may
almost any moment break loose, in
Pennsylvania or New York. Idle-
ness brds deviltry, and deyiltry,
when let loose, vents its spleen on
the weakest thing it can find… …….

There is an ancient legend which

Thebes, once slew. dragon and
sewed its teeth in the earth like
wheat. These dragon's teeth sprout-¡

It looks to me as if the white man

In the

only of his own life shall lose it. Our
so called great moral leaders fold
their arms and close their mouths

The state attorney is sworn to uphold
the dignity of the law. When asked
if he would est any of these citt-|
zens, he assured the public that he
would not. "Some of the best citi-
zens of the state were among that
crowd." he is reported to have given
as his excuse.
Are the "best citizens" allowed to
break the law with impunity? What
constitutes best citizen?"

The

bridle from under the Negro. At
Statesboro, Ga., the mob tied two
men to a stake, piled pine wood high
around them, saturated the pyre with
oll and set fire to it. Men, women
and children circled around this
awful scenę, hissing in maniacal glee
at the screams of these dying
wretches. One man was angered that
one of the burning wretches should
writhe ..nd twist to keep his head
out of the games. So he pummeled
him over the head with a piece of
wood. Never have Apache Indians
done such a thing.. To associate. this
kind of savagery with chivity is the
worst kind of blasphemy. Generally
the men who make pretenses at
avenging outraged women are the
dirtlest, most unprincipled hoodlums
of the community.
America aspires to the leadership
of the nations--the beaconship of
the world. Ifshe would give realiza-
tion to these aspirations, she must
stop her lynchings; she must stop
these ghastly burnings at the stake.
All the world knows of her hooting
hoodlums raiding jails and burning
human beings. Our mobs are a re-
proach before the world and a stench
in the nostrils of God.
Here was a vital subject for Mr.
Hcover's law enforcement commis-
sion. How can law ever reach a high
place in popular esteem when the
very beads of the nation, are afraid
to command the mob to halt? The
dykes of civilization can be main-
tained only if those charged with the
keeping of those lykes are courage-
ous and true. Lynchers are the most
vicious of lawbreakers. Society da
serves law and order. The majesty
of the law must be defended against
ruffianism, against these human
butchers. And if not, we may surely

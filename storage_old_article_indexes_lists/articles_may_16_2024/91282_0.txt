LYNCH LAW.
The Houston Telegraph expresses
a hope that the press of this State
will make lynch law odious. We
are gald to see the Telegraph speak
out against the references of matters,
that ought to be acted upon by the
legally constituted authorities, to
the court of Judge Lynch. The
Telegraph perhaps, thinks that
there is danger of mobs being encouraged
; it discourages those who
wish to administer punishment by
self- constituted authorities.
We are decidedly opposed to the
court of Judge Lynch, and regard
those who by taking the law into
their own hands administer punishment
, even where there is no doubt
of the victim's guilt, as committing
a crime which the laws of the country
should severely punish. We
will refer to the past; some who
thought that the laws were too slow
in dealing out punishment, gathered
in crowds and hung men- the
result is, that in looking over our
exchanges, we notice arrests of various
parties for having been engaged
in these disgraceful scenes.
We believe that up to 1860, it
was a source of pride to the citizens
of Travis county, that their county
had never had a mob in it. In 1860
a party of men thinking that the
law would not punish a man, who
they believed, had wronged them,
entered the Court House, and while
the prisoner was in the custody of
the Sheriff, shot and killed him.
This proceeding excited general indignation
, and those who did the
shooting had to leave the county to
escape the penalty of the law. In
1861, there were threats made that
a man would be taken out of jail
and hung. All the military companies
in Austin furnished guards to
defend the prisoner, and the threats
were not executed: In 1862 a citi-
zon of Travis county was arrested
and charged with having been concerned
in a murder. While he was
being taken to San Marcos by a
military guard, he was taken from
it and hung. He had enjoyed an
excellent reputation as a christian
and citizen.
In 1864, a man was arrested and
charged with having encouraged
Mexico.

While he was in the custody of the
military, one night a mob assembled
, took him and hung him on a
tree, near the ford where hundreds
pass. We have
of citizens had to
heard that some were shocked by
seeing boys throwing stones at the
lifeless body, The mob spirit, up
to this time, did not feel itself strong
enough to take life in the day time
and abide the consequences.
In the month of July, 1864, a mob
took and hung, in day time, three
men who had been carried to Aus-
tin by a military guard. There
were at that time, portions of three
military companies in the city. We
have been told that the Provost
Marshall advised and assisted in
the hanging. The men were hung
where thir bodies could be seen from
the residence of the family of the
lamented have understood Gen. Tom that Green their, and bodies we
were left unburied until Mrs. Green
requested that some one would remove
the awful spectacle.
We have given a short sketch of
the rise of mob law, in one of the
formerly, most law abiding counties
in this State. There was a majority
of the citizens which was opposed
to mobs, but it was powerless
and could not act against them.
It behooves all to frown down the
mob spirit, and to assure the advocates
of Jugde Lynch, that the laws
severely punish those who exe-
will cute his commands .-- Gal. Bulletin.

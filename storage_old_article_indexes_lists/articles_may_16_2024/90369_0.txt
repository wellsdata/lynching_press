Crime, Officers Arrive Just

Infuriated to Men,
LOS ANGELES June That, 27.-
Jim Burnett, a negro, was not lynched
yesterday afternoon near the extreme
southeasterly boundary of the
eity, was due to the timely arrival
of police in an automobile. Burnett
had committed crime for which
they burn men the at the stake in the
South, and had there been time for
preparation, that might have been his
fate. Another negro was his captor
and would have willingly assisted in
meting out swift ustice to the human
brute- if lynching is ever just- but
Burnett was whisked away to jail in
an automobile, and to that fact he
owes his life.
Laura Akers, aged 9, daughter of
poor parents who came here two
weeks ago from Bakersfield, was the
negro's victim. She was so frightfully
abused that she may not recover.
If she dies, her assailant may yet
feel the halter; if she recovers all
that can be done with him is to send
him to prison, for rape is not a capital
crime in California. not a can
The Akers family live in a tent-
house which they have pitched on Ed-
win avenue near the Los Angeles
river, not far from the intersection of
Boyle and Vernon avenues. Yester-
day afternoon, Mrs. Akers told her
two daughters to go to a little hillock
on the east side of the river near
Edwin avenue to pick greens for the
evening meal. Laura, aged 9, and
Clara, one year her unior, departed on
their task and the mother went about
her work without the
slightest
thought of impending danger.
An hour later the
woman was
startled by the screams of Clara, who
ran to her crying that a negro was
killing her older sister.
Mrs. Akers ran toward the tent-
house, arriving there ust in time to
see the negro depart. She called to
him, but with a yell the man turned
and started to run toward the river.
Mrs. Akers ran into the tent and
found her little daughter lying on the
bed in a frightful condition. The
frightened hild whispered the story
of the outrage to her mother, stating
that the negro, after his crime, had
carried her home.
Frantic with grief the mother ran
to the street. There she met A. Cur-
tis, a negro carpenter living in the
neighborhood. As soon as he heard
the story of the outrage he started
in pursuit of the fleeing Burnett

side of the river bed, the mother fell
from exhaustion and was assisted to
her home. Curtis yelled to white
men as he passed, telling them of the
crime, and they too, joined in the
search. Men dropped their work and
dashed madly along the road in pursuit
. Block after block toward the
country roads Burnett ran, ready to
drop with exhaustion and fright, but
spurred on for last desperate effort
by the yells one of his pursuers.
One by one, the pursuers slowed

last ne appeared at the home of Mrs.
J. J. Butts, near Goshen, while her husband
was away and at the point of a
pistol, compelled her and her two lit-
Ittle children to accompany him into the
woods back of the house.
Here he
assaulted the women and then told her
he was going to kill her and the children
to prevent her telling her husband
or friends. She appealed to the negro
for the lives of herself and children,
telling him that if he would accompany
her back to the house she would
give him$ 200 she had in a trunk there
and would not tell anyone
of the
crime. He consented to the plan, leaving
the children behind, they walked back
to the house.
When Mrs. Butts opened
the front door, she ran quickly in, and
slammed the door in his face, locking
it.
She quickly secured a pistol and
fired through the door, the negro re-
turned the fire, both receiving slight
flesh wounds. After emptying his gun
the negro became frightened and fled.
For almost a month he has been at
large with officers and posses scouring
the surrounding country for him. He
was captured this morning about 8
c'clock near Union Springs and placed
in the Bullock county jail.
News of the capture quickly spread
and a mob was formed early this morning
at Goshen. They took the Central
of Georgia train to Union Springs, arriving
there about ten o'clock. The
mob was slow in forming their plans
and the sheriff of Bullock county called
up the governor at Montgomery over

The governor had the riot call sounded
in Montgomery immediately but while
the soldiers were gathering in their
armories there the mob had stormed
the jail and secured, the prisoner.

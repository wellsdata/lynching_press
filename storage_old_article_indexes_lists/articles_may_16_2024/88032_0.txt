Batesville, Sept. 16.- An at
tempt was made early this morning
to spirit away Robert Crosby,
who yesterday evening shot and
killed Sheriff Jeff D. Morgan,
while the latter was taking him
to jail as a fugitive from Fulton
county. The plan was to get
Crosby on the morning train and
take him to Newport for safe
keeping. The threatening attitude
of the citizens compelled
the officers to abandon their efforts
to take Crosby from the
jail here. It became apparent
that all such attempts will be
resisted and probably result in a
lynching.
The general sentiment evidently
is that the prisoner must re
main in the jail at Batesville.
Excitement still runs high and
rumors are afloat that a large
mob from Salado, the dead sheriff's
old home, is coming to lynch
the murderer, and that if the
mob comes it will be
here. augmented

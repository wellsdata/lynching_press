NEW ORLEANS, March 31.- The Times
Democrat in an editorial referring to the
recall of Baron Favia, says:"
was no question of any unfriendliness There to
Italy or Italians. Eleven brigands and
assassins were executed, of whom nine
were American citizens and two are said
to be subjects of the King of Italy. This
would not have made the slightest difference
had these latter two been Rus-
sians or any other nationality, for the
race question did not enter into the
matter in the slightest degree. The
people New Orleans rose to suppress
an association of of assassins."

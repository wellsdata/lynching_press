A BAD WOMAN .-- Beyond question
Charlotte Harris, colored, who
was
lynched in East Rockingham was a bad
woman. She formerly belonged to
Loflin, whose family she attempted to poison
. She also threatened to burn the
barn of Mr. William B
Yancey,
and would doubtless have carried her
threat into effect but for her career
having been eut short by Jadge
gang.- Rockingham Register. Lynch's

Following, de extracts from it:
DC
" I stan to do as my illustrious
predece rover Cleveland, did, and
assert. ower of this nation against
all local nullifiers. Last summer I felt
impelled to write a letter calling upon
my countrymen to put down lynching.
But labor union terrorism and crime are
as great a national menace, as lynch law.
" Let me tell you that the first duty
of the officers of the law, whether they
be sheriffs, constables, municipal officers,
mayors, governors or the President himself
, is to maintain public order and put
down the mob with an iron hand."
After advising Donnelly to put a stop
to the strike the President is represented
as saying:
" In any case be assured I will keep my
hands off unless your folly brings you
into collision with the laws of the United
States, when my hand will go on in a way
you will not like. So far as I am concerned
you have barked up the wrong tree.
I am not to be either wheedled or frightened
into meddling with what is none
my business." of

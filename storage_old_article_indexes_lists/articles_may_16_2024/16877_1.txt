if I did not hear of a man being murdered near
St Louis in the year 1311, and of two men
being arrested, both tried and convicted, one
having a new trial granted him the, other being
hung. I told him that I thought I had. He
said he was the man that had the new trial
granted, and was acquitted; and,' said he,
hey hung the wrong man; he was innocent;
I am the guilty man; but they hung him and
cleared me. But, says, I you were under
a different name still, at that time.' He said,
Yes, by one of these names do you know
me, but my real name you are familiar
with. Your name,' said he,' I knew in the
year 1332; the gamblers called you John, but
Jonathan is your real name. My curiosity
was highly excited at the strange management
of the murderer. But you may imagine
increrse of it when he told me his real
the hame.

Negro Lynched in Maryland.
UPPER MARLBORO, Md., Oct. 20.- Just
before daybreak forty masked men rode up
to the jail and demanded the custody of
the negro Williams, who had confessed to
an attempted assault. Jailor Spicer, although
wholly unprepared for resistance,
refused to give up the keys. He was, however
, finally overpowered and Williams
was taken to a bridge near town and
hanged. A bullet hole was found near his
heart. The coroner's jury rendered a verdict
that Williams met his death at the
hands of unknown parties. Mrs. Hardesty
Williams's victim, is an aged lady.,

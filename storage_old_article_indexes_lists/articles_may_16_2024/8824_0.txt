The Latest Alabama Lynching.
BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Oct. 14.- The following
account of the lynching of four negroes
near Monroe Village yesterday has been
received: Last Friday night Richard L.
Johnson and his accomplished daughter,
Janette, were murdered in a most revolting
manner and the bodies burned to conceal
the crime. Four negroes were arrested
after several days' search. They
confessed the crime and were lodged in
jail. Yesterday a mob overpowered the
sheriff, took the fiends out, hung them to
a tree and riddled their bodies with bullets
. Then they cut them
down, tore
them limb from limb, gathered the pieces
together and burned them. The names of
the lynched men: Jim Packer and
brother, Mose Johnson were and Burrel Jones.

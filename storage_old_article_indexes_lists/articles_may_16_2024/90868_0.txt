The gallows, on last hangman's day, did
an unusually brisk business, no less than
six murderers having their necks legally
stretched, to say nothing of three lynch-
ings. Christian Reibling was hanged at
Lyndon, Ill., for killing a young man
named Albert Lucia in December last, because
the latter refused to sell the other,
while in a state of intoxication, a bottle of
gin. George Andrew Horn and William
Henry Gribben were hanged at Ashland,
Ohio, for murder of Harry Williams
near the village the of Polk, Ashland county,

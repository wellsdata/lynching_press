A NEGRO LYNCHED
In South Carolina For the Same
Old Crime.
Columbia, S. C., July 23.- Jim Gray, a
negro, was lynched today at Goldville,
Laurens county, by a party of men for
criminally assaulting the 13- year- old
daughter of one of the most respected
men in that neighborhood.
He was caught and hurried to Laurensing
for immediate trial. The grand jury had
been dismissed, however, and the so-
licitor secured an order for the removal
of the negro to the penitentiary here for
safe keeping. In trying to carry out his
plan the negro was taken from the con-
by a dozen or more men and quick
stable work was made of him.

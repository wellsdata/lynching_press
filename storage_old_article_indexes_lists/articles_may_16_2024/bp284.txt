The pattern is that of Hitler. For the

tims in cold blood. They, too, employed terro
ods, saying that in pursuing this line of conduc
were not violating anybody's civil rights. Of cour
The Nazis discounted human rights and felt no ob

the Georgia lynching situation we are face to face
not with Americanism, but with a type of Nazism in the
United States. If the people are responsible for the use
of Nazi methods in lynching four American citizens in
Georgia are not brought to justice, if this pattern of terror-
ism and murder is not disavowed by the American people,
then there is no minority group in this country which is
secure against the same kind of injustice to which the Ne-
groes of Georgia have been subjected.

If we have learned anything from the experience of
mankind under Hitlerism it is that injustice working
through terrorism must be stopped when it first appears.
Had the people of Germany refused to permit persecu-
tion of the Jews they would all have been spared the ex-
perience of persecution by the Nazi tyranny at a later
time.

What happened in Monroe, Georgia is not simply
the concern of Negroes. The injustice done to them is an
injustice done to us all. The human rights violated in
their case is the violation of the rights of us all.

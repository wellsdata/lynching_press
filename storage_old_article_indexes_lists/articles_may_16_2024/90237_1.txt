ALBANY MOB CHASES NEGRO.
Policeman Draws His Revolver and
Prevents Attack on Him.
Albany, N. Y., Aug. 9.- Staid old Al-
bany seemed bent on rousing a crowd
of nearly a thousand people into a mob
to lynch a negro who had stabbed a
white man this afternoon. But for the
pluck of Patrolman Begley, who with
his revolver kept the crowd at bay until
assistance arrived, no one knows
what the outcome might have been.
Two colored men were fighting on
Third street on Arbor hill. A white
man named Scharff tried to separate
them. Another negro named Bert Haz-
zelock told Scharff to attend to his own
business. Scharff and Hazzelock then
went at it and the latter stabbed
Scharff ir. the back with a razor. The
blow was a glancing one and cut only
skin deep.
This roused the whites. Hazzelock
started down Third street on the run
and a crowd headed by Scharff chased
him. Several blocks away Hazzelock
took refuge in a house on Second street.
By this time the crowd had grown to
hundreds and demanded the surrender
of Hazzelock.
Officer Begley drew his revolver and
kept the crowd back until he was joined
by another officer when they took
negro to the station house. the

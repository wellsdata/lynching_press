LYNCHING INNOCENT MEN.
The confession of a prisoner shows that when
two negroes were lynched recently in West Vir
ginia two innocent men were put to death. But
what do mobs of lynchers really care whether
or not their victims have been guilty of any
grave offence? The frenzied passion for murder
takes hold of such rioters as if they were
possessed of devils, and they act as if they
were insane for the glutting of their mad fury,
no matter how free from blame the objects of
their lawless violence may be.
Every lyncher in this era of enlightenment
and progress and in present conditions in the
United States should be looked upon as a cowardly
assassin, the sort of scoundrel who would
lie in ambush for any person whom he disliked
and would shoot his enemy in the back from a
secure hiding place without a sign or a word of
warning. Such dastards never engage in a fair
fight. Anything like an equal contest in any circumstances
or conditions has no attraction for
them. In fact, such fellows always run at top
speed if they an adversary who desires
nothing but an meet even chance with them.

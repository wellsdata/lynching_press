Bodies Cut Down
After the night of rioting, quiet
was restored around the courthouse
and county jail early this morning,
and the bodies of the mob victims
were cut down without molestation
from a thousand citizens who milled
around the grounds.
Spirited to the state reformatory
at Pendleton, another Negro, one of
the trio accused of killing a white
youth and attacking his sweetheart,
was safe.
Two other Negro prisoners were
taken to Huntington county jail.
The lynching victims were
Thomas Shipp, 18, and Abraham
Smith, 18.
Smith's body dangled until this
morning from the same maple tree
where he was hanged by the infuriated
mob at about 9:30 Thursday
night.
Shipp was hanged in the jail yard,
his body cut down a while later, and
dragged to the courthouse lawn to
be hoisted up to another maple,
grim reminder of the night of terror a.

MARION, Ind., Aug. 8.-
Downtown streets of Marion
through which late Thursday
night and early today surged
a tempest of hate, climaxed
by lynching of two young
Negroes, this afternoon were
calm. It was a calm, however,
that authorities feared might
be only a lull before a new and
more ferocious outburst of
race antagonism.
Only a few stragglers remained
of a crowd of several
thousand that tore the Ne-
groes from Grant county jail.
But groups of youthful Ne-
groes, ostensibly under the
influence of liquor, were reported
roaming through the
downtown section in autos,
mumbling threats of retaliation
for the lynchings.
Deputy sheriffs and police will be
on the alert to quell any fresh outburst
, chiefs of the county and city
law enforcing bodies indicated.
Throughout the night they patrolled
the Negro district, after threats
reported against residents there were.

A Lively Picnic.
MONTGOMERY, Ala., May 8.- In the
Western railroad, at Whitehall today,
two cars of drunken negro picnickers
were attached to the regular passenger
train. The negroes made a rush for the
ladies' car and some entered it, swearing
and using all all sorts of vulgar language.
The conductors organized a posse among
the passengers and trainmen and, arming
them with rifles and revelvers from
the express car, drove the negroes back.
On the arrival here a large number of
them were jailed. Crowds at several
along the line made an attempt
stations to lynch them.

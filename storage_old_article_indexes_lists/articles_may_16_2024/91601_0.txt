" Getting my horse I rode on into the
timber a mile farther and began to pick
huckleberries. I picked a five- gallon can
of berries and then rode home to my
father's place near Anatone, passing on
the way within seventy- five feet of where
the dead body of my victim was lying.
When I got home about 7 o'clock I told
my mother that a little girl was lost and
a large party of men were out looking for
her. I did not say that I had seen the
girl.
" I slept pretty well last night, but woke
at 3 o'clock Monday morning and could
see the whole scene of my killing of the
girl in my mind. I did not sleep well
the rest of the night. After breakfast
Monday I did not think much of the occurrence
until I was arrested yesterday.
afternoon. I was too busy haying during
the day to think of the matter.
" When officer first arrested me he
did not say what it was for. Later he
told me. At first I denied in court that
I had seen the girl at all, but when they
got me into a net I told the Coroner's
jury the same story I have told you
" I am sorry I killed the girl because.
SLAYER PICKS BERRIES.
Following is Hamilton's confession:
" Yes, I killed the girl. I met her in
the woods half a mile from Farrish Mill.
I asked where she was going and she
said to Sunday school at Kelly's schoolhouse
. I got off my horse, put my armc
about the girl and hugged and kissed her.
She asked me to let her alone, as she
wanted to go to Sunday school. I folded
both arms about her and carried her
about seventy- five feet from the road into
a clump of bushes. She was badly frightened
and could not tell her name or age.
" At first I thought I would let her go.
After talking with her several minutes
I became afraid she would tell and started
to choke her. She got black in the
face and her tongue stuck out of her
mouth. I let go of her throat, went
about ten feet and got a club, with which
I struck her on the right side of the head.
She gave a little outcry and then lay
still. I struck her on the left side of the
temple and then rolled her over with my
foot and struck her on the back of the
head. After watching her a few
minutes I knew she was dead. for
A vast mob soon assembled outside the
little jail and awaited a contingent from
Anatone, the scene of the crime. When
it arrived an assault was made on the
jail. Excitement was at a white heat and
Hamilton cowered in his cell in deadly
fear.
Special deputies were on guard at the
jail, but their number was of little weight
against the heavy crowd outside.
At midnight 1000 people were in the
town and the jail was surrounded. Hundreds
of people from Lewiston and the
populace from all Asotin County had
gathered. Finally an assault was made.
the murderer was taken out and quickly
lynched

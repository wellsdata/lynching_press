Law Versus
Lynch
By Judge RICHARD MARKLEY
Two gentlemen of Four Aces, a mining
town, were consulting as to how
to get rid of an enemy. One demurred
at shooting since a court had been established
.
" You see, Jim," he said," they'll keep
us in jail forever waitin' to try us."
" Don't you worry about that, Pete,"
said the other." This yere
Isn't ready for real law yet." community
So they shot their man and stood
trial.
The citizens of Four Aces, eager to
try the new legal system that had been
introduced, did not inconvenience the
two criminals at all by delay. The
murder was committed in the morning,
and by 3 o'clock in the afternoon the
trial commenced. A limb of the law
named Simpson was prosecuting attorney
, and one Waterman was assigned
by the court to defend the accused.
To save time they were tried together.
The first hour was occupied in fencing
between the prosecutor and counsel for
the defense, the latter claiming

" Your honor," said the lawyer, turn-
ing to the judge," I move that this
man's testimony be stricken out. He
did not see the shooting. He merely
saw a reflection."
The judge considered for awhile,
then decided that a reflection was not
a thing in itself, therefore the testimony
of the barkeeper was not to be
considered by the jury.
There were several other persons in
the room at the time of the crime, but
counsel for defense proved that the
eyesight of one was bad, that another
was so deaf that he couldn't hear a
cannon fired, to say nothing of a revolver
, while a third had been sitting
at a table in a jog in the room where
he could not see the group in question.
Friends of the accused swore they
had known them for years, that both had
taught Sunday school and neither had
ever carried a revolver- indeed, they
would not know how to handle such a
weapon.
The prosecutor endeavored to impeach
the veracity of these witnesses,
but when he called on citizens present
to swear that they wouldn't believe
them under oath one of the witnesses
announced that if any dared to

silence in the court. The judge seem-

acquit the murderer, but he could not
see how he could do anything else. He
was scatching his head when Oliver
Budd, a citizen of Four
Aces and prominent leader of the late vigilance
committee that had ceased operations
in view of the introduction of law into
and said: the place, arose

" Let all the witnesses for the prosecution

When the line was formed Judge
Lynch or Mr. Budd said to them:
These yere two men air charged
with the killin' of Charles Benton,
gambler. All of you who know for
sarten that they done it hold up your
hands."
Every witness held up a hand.
" That'll do," said Mr. Budd; then,
turning to the large number of spectators
present, he added:
" Citizens of Four Aces, you have
seen a trial by court methods and a
trial by Lynch methods. All who are
In favor of the fust say' Aye.'"
A dead silence followed.
" All those in favor of these galoots
bein' treated to Lynch law say' Aye.'"
There was a roar of" Ayes" that
struck terror into the accused men.
" Such bein' the case," Mr. Budd con-
eluded by virtue of being head of the
vigilance committee," I call upon the
members for the purpose of eliminatin
the prisoners."'
Ten minutes later two forms were
and the citizens of Four Aces
had dangling resumed their usual vocations.

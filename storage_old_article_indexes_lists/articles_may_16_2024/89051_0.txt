A. D. Storms, the self- confessed murderer
of Mrs. Rathbun and daughter,
will not be tried in Burlington. His attorneys
secured a change of venue to
the Wapello district court, the case being
set there for Monday, September 5,
next. The attempt of the mob to lynch
Storms and the state of public feeling
were the grounds which Judge With-
row granted the change on.

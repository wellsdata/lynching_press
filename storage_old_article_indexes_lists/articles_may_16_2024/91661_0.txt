NEGRO RIOTERS.
A State of Siege at Jacksonville, Fla.
Troops Called Out.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., July 6.- The only
serious circumstances growing out of
last night's demonstrations by negroes
about the county jail, was an attempt of
a negro guard, one block away from the
jail, to stop the passage of a white man.
The was armed, and
negro
white turned back
the man
assistance, He returned with
for
a deputy sheriff, two constables,
and a policeman, and they attempted to
disarm the negro. They were instantly
fired upon from all directions by negroes
in concealment. Three of the posse
received slight flesh wounds, and they
all obliged to leave. After
were
placing Gatling gun in position
in front of the jail, the negroes were
scattered, but kept themselves in squads
conveniently near so as to rally readily
if necessary. There was no further disturbance
during the night, and the
troops have control of the situation. It
is said, however, that a large number of
armed negroes are arriving hourly from
the surrounding country and far away
points, and as an extra precaution
the St. Augustine guards. the Gainesville
guards and Halifax rifles of Dayton,
have been ordered to hold themselves in
readiness to report at Jacksonville.
There is considerable excitement in the
city, and it is hoped the negroes can be
dissuaded from the belief that Reed, the
murderer, is to be lynched. They outnumber
the troops five to one.
Adjutant- General Long of the Florida
state troops arrived tonight. Two companies
from St, Augustine also reported
for duty, and the late trains from
Gainesville and Dayton are expected to
bring more troops. The troops
have established picket lines around
the jail; no one is allowed to pass.
Two twelve- pound guns and a Gatling
gun are ready for use before the jail.
At 11:30 some negroes attempted to
pass the picket lines. They were fired
upon, but returned the fire and a skirmish
ensued. Two negroes are reported
fatally wounded. One soldier
was
slightly injured. The city is in a great
state of excitement.
An investigation shows that only one
statenegro was wounded in the scrimmage at
11:30 p.m., and his wound not serious.
The soldier's wound Was caused
by the accidental discharge of
8 rifle. The troops are arresting
all suspicious looking negroes, nearly
thirty having been run in already. They
are all armed and they jail authorities
take the weapons from them promptly.
No further disturbance is looked for
night. to-

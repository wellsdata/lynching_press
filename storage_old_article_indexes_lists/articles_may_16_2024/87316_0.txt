AT Van Buren, Arkansas, on the 13th,
three men named Rufus and Jackson Cov
Redington, brothers, and a son of the latter,
were killed by two brothers named Silas and
Ben Edwards. Several others were badly
cut and injured on both sides. An old feud
existed between the parties, but the led-
wardses, who have been the terror of that
part of the State, were the aggre sors.
While trying to make their escape they were
overtaken by the constable and his posse
and lodged in the jail It is thought they
will be lynched..

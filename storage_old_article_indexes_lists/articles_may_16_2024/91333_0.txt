On Saturday night last a band of disguised
persons, eight or ten in number, went on the
Harris farm, about two miles below Larkins-
ville, and took from his house, where he was in
bed asleep, and old negro man- Ned Larkin-
and made him get upon a high stump near his
cabin, and shot him with several guns, mang.
ling him in a most inhuman manner killing
,
him instantly
" They also. went to the cabin of Frank Lar-
kin, on the same place, awaked him from his
bed, took him from his house, marched him
around in his night clothes, then took him to
a thicket near the place, made him strip himself
, whipped him with withes, kicked him
down, and when he undertook to run away
from them he was shot down, filling one shoul-
der and the back of his neck full of shot. He
is suffering exceedingly and Dr. Boyd, his
attending physician, thinks, he will die."

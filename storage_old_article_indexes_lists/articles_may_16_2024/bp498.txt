Walling, noted white writer, said in
an artich, in the Independent for
September 3, entitled "Race War
in the North:"
"Either the Spirit of the
abolitionists, of Lincoln and
Lovejoy must be reveired and
we must come to treat the Ne-
Ero on a plane of absolute po-
litical and social equality, or
Vardaman and Tillman will
soou have transferred the race
war to the North... The spirit
of the abolitionists must be re
rired."
Accordingly. Walling, a southern
white man. Dr. Henry Moskowitz
and Mary White Orington, with
others, met in a small New York
City apartment in the first work of
1909, and cailed a national confer-
ence for Lincoln's birthday, at
which time the mounting evits of
disfranchisement, segregation and
mob violence were discusssed. With
the assistance of Oswald Garrison
Villard, then publisher of the New
York Evening Post, another con-
ference was arranged for May 31-
June 1. It was attended by 1000
people. A Committee of forty was
organized with Miss Frances Blas
coer (white) as secretary. During
that year four great mass meetings
were held. thousands of pamphlets
distributed and hundreds of mem-
bers enrolled.

Where 120 distinguished leaders of

elated widely an ADDRESS TO
THE NATION upon the evils of
lynching, demanding a congression-

140 leading federal and state of
cials and citizens from 30 states,
including the South. It published

sulted in the introduction into the j

President) Charles Curtis in Jau-

for a Senate investigation of lynch-

Kentucky N. A. A, C, P, branches,
an anti-lynching law was passed
and signed by the governor. A simi.

ginia and a more drastic onę in
Minnesota. Through the efforts of
the association the widow of Joe
Stewart, a Negro lynched ar Laur-

$2,000.
The long and determined fight of
the association for a federal anti-
lynching law enlminated in the
passage of the Dyer Bi!! in the
House of Representatives on Janu
ary 26, 1922 by a vote of 30 to
119. The national office with the
full support and cooperation of the
branches now pushed the fight on
every front for passage through this
Senate. Great publicity and tre-
mendous pressure was brought to
bear upon the senators from every
possible source. Despite these f
forts a combination of abandon-
ment the bill by Republican sena-
tors and a filibuster by southern
senators, the dght was lost.
Today, after a passage of ten
years in which lynching steadily
declined until the rise from 10 to
2 last year, the association is
again fighting for the passage of an
anti-lynching law. This time the

LYNCHERS FAILED.
A Mob Attacks the Jail at Tampa to
Get Two White Men.
Jacksonville, Fla., May 26.- A special
to the Times- Union from Tampa, Fla.,
says:" Last night a mob attacked the
jail. They wanted Stevenson and McNeill,
white men, who are now on trial for the
murder of Marshal Whitehurst at Tarpon
Springs. The mob was composed of
the dead man's friends, and fearing
Stevenson and McNeill would be acquitted
they decided to lynch them. The
sheriff,, however, stood off the mob."

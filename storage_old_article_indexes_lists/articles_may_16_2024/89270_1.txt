The trial of the two men for murder
in the first degree opened here about
two weeks ago with W. W. Erwin for
,
the defense. Erwin moved for separate
trials, and the case of Musgrove was
taken up first. The trial closed on
Thursday and at one o'clock Friday
,
morning the jury returned a verdict of
murder in the second degree after being
out eight hours. This, together
with the fact that Cingmars' trial would
have to occur in another county, owing
to the difficulty of securing a jury, incensed
a large portion of the communi-
their commendation the actions of
the mob in lynching the of two men.

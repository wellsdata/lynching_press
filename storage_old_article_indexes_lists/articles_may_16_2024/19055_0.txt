It was hard to say whether in the code of California capitalists
lynching comes under the head of religion or patriotism, but it was in
the park which the Santa Clara kulaks tried to take away from the
Communists that a mob hung the kidnappers of Brooke Hart.
The lynching had the approval, if not the instigation, of the local
rich. Now it has the official sanction of Governor Rolph. The chief executive
of California not only approved and praised the lynchers. He
is now anxious to convert lynching into a general custom.
" I am checking San Quentin and Folsom prisons," he announces,
" to find out what kidnappers they have. I am thinking of paroling them
to those fine patriotic citizens of San Jose who know how to handle such
a situation."
That settles it. Lynching is not religious, but patriotic. It is to be
come an institution for the protection of the lives of the rich, since
kidnappers, as a rule, do not kidnap he poor, whose relatives are unable
to pay heavy ransoms.
There have, of course, been cases where poor men have been kid
napped, but not with a ransom in view. These have been strike leaders,
hurled by gangs into automobiles and taken out of the region where they
were active organizing the workers. No capitalist paper, no capitalist of
It has never been
ficial has ever agitated against such kidnappings
suggested that mobs lynch those who abduct, torture or kill working
class leaders.
On the contrary, mobs are encouraged to lynch strikers and their
leaders. The same capitalist state which encourages the lynching of those
who kidnap and murder the rich, tolerates and approves the murder of
poor when these fight for living wages.

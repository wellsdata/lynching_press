" Patriotic citizens throughout the
country feel the shame which lynchings
cast upon the nation but they have assumed
partial responsibility for this
shame by their silence and their acquie-
sence. The time has now come when
citizens of the United States can no
longer contemplate without protest the
setting at nought of the fundamental
principles upon which their citizenship
is based.
" The undersigned, therefore, as citizens
of the United States without sectional
or party bias, with the interestent
only of the republie at heart, urge all
public spirited men and women to oppose
with all their power the recurrence
of the crime and the shame of
mob murder, they urge the governors
of the several states to do all that is
passible to prevent and punish lynch-
ing; they pledge their support to the
officers of the law who, in the face of
mob excitement, discharge their duties;
and they urge upon the congress of the
United States nation- wide investigation
of lynching and mob murder to the
dthat means may be found to end
en this scourge."

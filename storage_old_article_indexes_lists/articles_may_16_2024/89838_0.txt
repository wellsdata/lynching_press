" SUNSHINE"
By Mrs. Nellie Maye Taylor
Hello there here and every-
where. The big convention of the
G. O. P. is going on. I wonder who
will it OK! Well fifty years from
today we will hardly know the difference
. Do you think so? The girl
who is trying to get in her home
state University to study law via
of the Supreme Court, has had an
offer to study abroad in a large
university. She should accept. A
police judge in Birmingham, Ala-
bama honored Hitler last week by
saying, white man is superior to
the Negro. Also in Birmingham, a
Negro Preacher was lynched by
the sheriff. Rev. C. L. Butler was
the victim of unfortunate circumstances
. Negroes have constantly
been killed by police bullets in the
last two and a half months. The
F. B. I. has been called in, but
they can never the guilty ones.
The Negro has find been looked down
on as a criminal and inferior- the
white man as a God. I wonder why
everywhere they go there is al-
( ways trouble and confusion. In
Africa, the parts where there are
no whites, the people have no
prisons or locks on their doors.
When the Negroes were brought
over here as slaves I doubt if any
of them were criminals. Newgate
Calendar states that English
prisons were overcrowded after
America won independence and in
1782, America refused to let two
ship- loads of convicts land. It
seems as if America was the dumping
ground for England's convicts
and prostitutes. So many that Ben
Franklin once threatened to send
England rattlesnakes in return.
Oh! well, some day we'll understand
. Maybe if not in this life
maybe in the next. Don't forget
to spread sunshine in the valley
of Sun. Bye now- so long-
' til the then.

AGAIN IN LIMELIGHT.
Two events, awful in their nature
, have occurred recently to
bring the State of Illinois prominently
before the public eye. One
lynching, a perversion of constituted
authority, so diabolical and
cruel in its exhibition of the working
of savage humanity that the
entire country stands in amazed
horror! The other a mining explosion
, a cataclysm, in which hundreds
of human beings were hurled
into eternity without warning.

of men. It is passing strange that
almost all lynchings are followed
by great catastrophes involving the
loss of many lives among the
whites.

recent lynching in Illinois was especially
bloodthirsty. During the
last few years disgraces of this
kind have increased with alarming
frequency. There is not a good
citizen in the state, black or white,
who condones the awful offense of
the culprit. No Negro would ask
for an evasion of the law for a
guilty member of his race. But he
would ask that the law be respected
. We are proud of the stand
taken by Governor Deneen and
other state officials in their efforts
to suppress such lawless outbreaks.
The results will be watched by all.
The ministers of Cairo unite in declaring
that the present conditions
are due to the corrupt political
conditions existing in their town.
Lynch law is bad from any view
point. Let the good people of Il-
join hands to suppress all
linois kinds of lawlessness.

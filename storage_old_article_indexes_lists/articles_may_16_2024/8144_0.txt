DIED FIGHTING.
A Desperate Negro's Rifle Was Still
Cracking When the Blazing
Fell In Upon Him. Roof
Newmansville, Fla., January 13.-
Chased by a posse, Harry Jordan, a negro
desperado, wanted for murderously
assaulting Dr. J. N. Cloud, took refuge
in an unoccupied house near Alaichu
yesterday afternoon. The negro barricaded
the doors and swore he would
kill the first man who attempted to enter
. The posse poured in volley after
volley, riddling the house with bullets,
but not injuring Jordan, who returned
the fire with his Winchester. Finally
the posse resolved to set fire to the
house, thinking the flames would drive
the negro out, when he would be easily
captured. The torch was applied in
several places and soon the house was
enveloped in flames. The negro, however
, made no effort to escape.
tioned himself in the center of the
burning building and fired his Win-
chester in a vain endeavor to kill some
of his pursuers. The desperado's rifle
continued to crack until the roof fell
in and he was buried by blazing debris.
Jordan was known as a bad negro, having
killed, it said, three men. He fre-
boasted that no white man
would quently ever capture him alive.

NEGRO LYNCHED.
In the Presence of Many People Sam
Hose Was Burned to Death.
Before the Body Was Cool It Was Cut to
Pleces and Bones Crushed- Ex- Gov.
Atkinson, Who Interfered, Was
Threatened With Death.
NEWNAN, Ga., April 24.- In the presence
of nearly 2,000 people, who sent
aloft yells of defiance and shouts of
joy, Sam Hose, a Negro who committed
two of the basest acts known to crime.
was burned at the stake in a public
road one and one- half miles from here
Sunday afternoon. Before the torch was
applied to the pyre. the Negro was
deprived of his ears, fingers and other
portions of his anatomy. The Negro
plead pitifully for his life while the
mutilation was going on, but stood the
ordeal of fire with surprising fortitude
. Before the body was cool it
was cut to pieces, the bones were
crushed into small bits and even the
tree upon which the wretch met his
fate was torn up and disposed of as
souvenirs. The Negro's heart was cut
in several pieces as was also his liver.
Those unable to obtain the ghastly
relics direct, paid their more fortunate
possessors extravagant sums for them.
Small pieces of bone went for 25 cents
and a bit of the liver crisply cooked
sold for 10 cents. As soon as the Negro
was seen to be dead, there was a tremendous
struggle among the crowd
which had witnessed his tragic end to
secure the souvenirs. A rush was made
for the stake and those near the body
were forced against it and had to fight
for their freedom. Knives were quick-
ly produced and the body was soon dismembered
..
The mob was composed of citizens of
Newnan, Griffin, Palmetto and other
little towns in the country roundabout
Newnan, and of all the farmers who
had received word that the burning
was to take place.
Hon. W. Y. Atkinson, formerly governor
of Georgia, met the mob as he
was returning from church and appealed
to them to let the law take its
course. In addressing the mob he used
these words:
" Some of you are known to me, and
when this affair is finally settled in
the courts you may depend upon it
that I will testify against you."
A member of the mob was seen to
draw a revolver and level it at Gov.
Atkinson, but his arm was seized and
the pistol taken from him.
Hose confessed to killing Cranford,
but denied that he had outraged Mrs.
Cranford. Before being put to death
the Negro stated that he had been paid
$ 13 by" Life" Strickland, a Negro
preacher at Palmetto, to kill Cranford.
Sunday night a mob of citizens was
scouring the country for Strickland,
who has left his home, and will lynch
him if caught.
Gov. Candler has been asked to send
troops here to preserve order for a day
or two, as it is feared the Negroes may
wreak vengeance, many threats to
that effect having been made.
ATLANTA, Ga., April 24.- The Constitution
says Monday:" The terrible
expiation which Sam Hose was forced
to pay for his crime will arouse a flood
of discussion carried on by those who
know the facts on the one side and by
those who do not care for facts on the
other.
" But while the form of this crimi-
,
nal's punishment can not be upheld,
let those who are disposed to criticise
it look into the facts and by these facts
temper the judgment they may render.
" An unassuming, industrious and
hard working farmer, after his day's
toil, sat at his evening meal. Around
him sat wife and children happy in the
presence of the man who was fulfilling
to them every duty imposed by nature.
At peace with the world, serving God
and loyal to humanity, they looked
forward to the coming day.
" Noiselessly the murderer, with uplifted
ax, advanced from the rear and
sank it to the hilt in the brain of the
unsuspecting victim.
Tearing the
child from the mother's breast he
flung it into the pool of blood oozing
from its father's wound.
" Then began the culmination which
I has dethroned the of the
reason people
of Western Georgia during the past
week.
" The wife was seized, choked, thrown
upon the floor, where her clothing lay
in the blood of her husband. and ravished
.
" Remember the facts! Remember
the dark night in the country home!
Remember the slain husband, and,
above all, remember that shocking
degradation which was inflicted by the
black beast, his victim swimming in
her husband's warm blood as the brute
held her to the floor!
" Keep the facts in mind! When the
picture is painted of the ravisher in
flames, go back and view that darker
picture of Mrs. Cranfor outraged
the blood of her murdered husband in."

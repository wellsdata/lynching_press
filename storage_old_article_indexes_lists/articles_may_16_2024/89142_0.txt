MEMBERS OF MOB
NAMED BY WITNESS
IN SHIPP HEARING GOVERNMENT
WITNESS TELLS OF FOUR MEN
IN THE MOB WHICH LYNCHED
THE NEGRO JOHNSON.
14.- For the
Chattanooga, February
first time during the Shipp hearing there
were alleged members of the mob that
hung the negro Ed Johnson named today.
J. M. Stonecipher a government witness,
,
named four, and told of alleged conversations
he had with them both before and
after the lynching.
Commissioner Maher made a ruling today
that no person would be allowed in
the court room except such as could secure
seats. This rule was necessary because
of the crush, especially of negroes,
since the case opened.
Today the custom house was crowded
with negroes to a greater extent than
usual, but not more than forty gained admittance
to the court room.
Excitement was stirred to a considerable
extent today by the character of evidence
produced. The public looks askance upon
the possibility that Sheriff Shipp may be
convicted by negro testimony. Three ne-
groes were witnesses today, among them
being a former cook in Captain Shipp's
family. She told of dinner table conversations
that indicated knowledge on the
part the sheriff that the negro would
likely of be lynched.

A 17- YEAR- OLD BOY GOES TO THE
PENITENTIARY FOR FIFTEEN
YEARS FOR THE MURDER OF C.
ZOOBER, A PLAYMATE.
Meridian, Miss., April 23 .-( Special.)-
George Leatherwood, the 17 year old boy
who killed C. Zoober, his playmate, near
McNeil, this state, during a fist fight, he
cutting the throat of his victim as well
as almost severing his arm, was sentenced
to the penitentiary for fifteen years
at Poplarville. The youth and those in
the crowded court room wept as the
judge feelingly talked to him in passing
sentence.
Ranse Brooks, a negro, shot and seriously
wounded N. N. Wheeler, a white
planter, about four miles from this city.
The planter told the negro to return some
borrowed articles and called the negro a
liar when the latter claimed to have
already returned them. The negro drew
a pistol, saying he would not take a
lie from any white man, and shot one
time, the bullet taking effect near the
right hip joint. A posse of angry citizens
are said to be scouring the woods for
the negro with threats of lynching if
he is caught.
Accusing one negro of being a police
pimp, four others attempted to assault
Ike Bell at the latter's home, in the outskirts
of the city. Bell shot one of the
negroes in the arm, and then had all four
arrested. It was shown in the trial that
the negroes had disguised themselves and
waited at Bell's door for him. Each was
heavily fined by the Mayor for
ing whitecapping. attempt-

However ponder over the statement
_" Even if he sometimes fights in the
wrong way, he fights for what is
right." Let us venture the query,
Can you do right by doing wrong?
" Never," we make answer. What a
strange mind that sees righteousness
in wrong. The editor of the" Duluth
Herald" takes the position of the man
who justifies the lynching of a negro
rapist by insisting that the wrong
way corrects evil conditions. Isn't it
absurd to make any such contention.
You cannot correct a wrong by committing
another wrong The editor
.
of" Duluth Herald" says distinctly
that we are wrong but he being the
Oracle of the Pine Stump, his philo-
soophy of the jungle must carry
" ooney, weight. Dear Editor, read the
chapter of Romans, yes, it's in
12th the Bible, and learn how wild you are.

implicated in the lynching of Craven, at
Leesburg, Va., on Thursday night.
Nipple was taken before Justice Wood
but was remanded to jail for a further
hearing, which at the request of the Vir-
ginia authorities, was postponed until
next week. Nipple, it is alleged was confined

the mob which lynched Craven attempted
to break in. Nipple it is said, assisted
the mob and was seen wielding one of
the sledge with which the door
of the cell hammers was smashed in.

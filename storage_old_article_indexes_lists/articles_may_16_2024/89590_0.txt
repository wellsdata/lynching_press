Young Spicer, who is 30 years of age,
was charged with having hired Joe Green,
his negro chauffeur, to kill Mrs. Spicer,
and it was testified that Spicer, a few
hours later, led the mob which lynched
Green.
During the trial which lasted a week,
much sensational testimony was developed
as a result of which presiding Judge
Alston ordered Spicer removed to the
county jail for safe keeping,
pending Montgomery an appeal.

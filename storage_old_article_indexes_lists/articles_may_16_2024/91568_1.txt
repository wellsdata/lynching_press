Assailant of a Young Girl Is Hanged
to a Tree.
MENA, Ark., Feb. 20.- A mob of eight
determined men took Feter Berryman, a
desperate negro, cut of the City Jail at
1 o'clock this morning and hanged him
to a tree. The crime of which Berryman
was accused was an attack on a 12- year-
old girl, whose condition is critical.
The masked men met Night Officer Al
Jones and compelled him at the point of
guns to hand over the keys and his revolver
. Two of them were left to guard
Jones, while the others went to the jail
and secured the negro. About 2 o'clock
they returned to where the officer was being
guarded and gave him his keys and
revolver. Then the men quietly disappeared
.
About two months ago this negro attacked
an engineer with an ax, very nearly
killing him, and he has been guilty
numerous other offenses. of

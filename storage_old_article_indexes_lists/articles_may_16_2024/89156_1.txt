FEAR KIDNAPED
BOY IS MURDERED
Italian Disorders Subside In New Or-
leans- Search of Homes and
Arrests Abandoned.
New Orleans, June 17.- The Italian dis-
orders and threats of lynching in New
Orleans entirely subsided today. A secret
and well organized effort to track the
Lamana boy by the regular
kidnaped
detective force has take the place of the
blustering search of private houses by unauthorized
crowds and the rushing of spe-
clal trains with armed deputies aboard to
towns suspected of harboring the kidnapers
, all of which characterized last
week's search and made part of it a
useless display. Wholesale arrests of Ital-
ians have stopped.
The police express fear that the La-
mana boy has been killed, but say they
have clews enough to be fairly sure of
securing him if the child is still alive.
The Lamana family has arranged for
special mass with prayers for the
recovery. boy's

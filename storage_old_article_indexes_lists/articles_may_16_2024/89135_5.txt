WHITE VICTIM DIES
NEGRO IS IN JAIL
CIRCUS IN SOUTH CAROLINA HAS
AROUSED MUCH FEELING, AND
MAY NOT BE ALLOWED TO EXHIBIT
.
Columbia, S., C., October 7.-J. E. Gail-
lard, one of the white men shot by Henry
Adams, allas Sam Small, at Mining Fri-
day evening, died from his njuries today
. Adams was an employe of Colum
Bros.' circus and became involved in a
difficulty just as the train was departing
for Sumter. At Sumter a mob was formed
for the purpose of lynching, the negro,
but Sheriff Muldrow evaded the mob by
taking the prisoner from the train and
driving across the country to a station on
the Seaboard Air Lne, where he boarded
the train for Columbia. Adams was placed
in the penitentiary this morning for safe
keeping.
Other members of the circus who were
arrested as witnesses are being held at
Bishopville.
The circus is scheduled to show at Sum-
ter on Wednesday, but fearng trouble, an
effort is being made to have the license
revoked and prevent the circus from appearing
in that city. Threats have been
made that would be trouble should
the show go there to Sumter.

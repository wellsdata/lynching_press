NEGRO LYNCHED IN OREGON.
An Unmasked Crowd Does the Deed
In Broad Daylight.
MARSHFIELD, Ore., Sept. 19.
Alonzo Tucker, a negro, who assaulted
Mrs. Dennis near Libby Wednesday,
has been lynched. A body of coal miners
, heavily armed, marched into town
during the evening. The marshal, who
had Tucker in custody, attempted to
take him from the jail just as the
miners entered, and a rush was made
for the negro. He managed to give his
custodian the slip and jumped under
the wharf into the mud flats and elud-
ed both officers and mob for several
hours. The miners stationed armed
guards at every point of egress from
the city Every corner of the
. town
was searched, and finally two boys located
the fugitive under a store. The
boys fired at him with air guns and
drove him, from his hiding place. As
he emerged a ball from a rifle caught
him in the right leg.
Tucker ran into a store and was followed
by the miners, who started to
hang him in the store, but decided to
take him to the scene of the crime. A
start was made, but the negro died
from his wounds, and the mob hanged
the body to a beam on the South
Marshfield bridge. Not a masked man
was in the crowd, and everything
done in broad daylight. was

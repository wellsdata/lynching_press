MINISTERS PASS
RESOLUTIONS ON
SATURDAY'S RIOT
Regretting the mob spirit that prevailed
Saturday night and commending highly
the bravery of the police and other officials
in their successful efforts to prevent
a lynching, the Methodist misters
of the Birmingham and Bessemer districts
at their regular meeting passed
the following resolutions:
" The Methodist ministers of the Bir-
mingham and Bessemer districts in their
regular meeting of June the 21st in the
Birmingham First Church wish to express
their profound regret at the action
of some of the citizens of this community,
when on last Saturday night they yielded
to the mob spirit and turned the
streets of law- abiding Birmingham into
a scene of turmoil and peril.
" We in no way condone impertinence,
insolence or crime, but when men, whether
black or white, become offenders, we
insist that it is the duty of the law and
not the mob to punish. We congratulate
and honor our brave policemen and officials
in their determined and successful
effort, at the risk of their own lives,
to save the accused negro from the wrath
of the mob.
" We assure them that not only do they
have the gratitude of all law- abiding citizens
for saving us of the disgrace
public lynching, but that we
partici-
of a
believe that many of the
pants in the riot, in their calmer moments,
will be thankful that they were saved
from the sin of such an unjustifiable murder
as the lynching of this negro would
have been.

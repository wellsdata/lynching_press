The Shame of Lawlessness.
Lawlessness is not less such, but more,
where it usurps the functions of the peace officer
and of the cours. The frequent lynching
of colored people accused of crime is without
the excuse which has sometimes been urged
by mobs, for a failure to pursue the appointed
methods for the punishment of crime. that the
accused have an undue influence over courts
and juries. Such acts are a reproach to the
community in which they occur, and so far as
they can be made the subject of federal jurisdiction
, the strongest repressive legislation is
demanded. A public sentiment that will sustain
the officers of the law in resisting mob
and protecting accused persons in their custody
should be promoted by every possible
means.
The officer who gives his life in the brave
discharge of this duty is worthy of specis
honor. No lesson needs to be so urgently in
pressed upon our people as this, that n
worthy end or cause can be promoted by
lessness. lay

whose affliation with a secret order
has been openly charged and not de-

the bar of justice those who defied

And who, in defying it, struck at
the very foundation of our system of

The lynching of the three Negroes
at Alken was one of the most das-
tardly crimes ever committed in this
country. The more reprehensible it

sacred duty of enforcing the law, and
preserving the integrity of the ju-

guilty pay a just debt to society.

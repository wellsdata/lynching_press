Lynchers in Mexico to Be Sentenced to
Death
Mexico, City, Mexico, November 15.-
Great crowds surrounded the grim old
prison at Belen and the vicinity of the
palace of justice this morning when thirteen
prisoners, mostly ex- police officers,
implicated in the lynching of Arnolfo Arroyo
, were taken through the streets in
wagons and coaches for trial. Shouts of
" kill them" were heard from the indignant
populace, but the prisoners were
well guarded by mounted and foot police.
The public prosecutor asked for the
death penalty on Villavicencio, ex- inspector
, who suggested the murder to his
chief, Velasaye, the inspector general of
police who committed suicide in prison.
Villavicenio expected to escape with life
imprisonment.
Manuel Belido, major of police, is one
of the principal criminals, as he was
privy to the crime and took no means of
preventing it. Miguel Caberoa, assistant
chief of the detective service, also knew
of the projected killing and took no steps
to prevent it. Maurosanchex, policeman,
was guarding Arroyo and was aware of
the intended crime and tightened up Arroyo's
straight jacket so he could offer
no resistance. Iglacio Pardaue led the
band of assassins. Capital sentences are
asked in all these cases.
The other criminals are of minor degree
, but some of them are likely to
sentenced to death. be

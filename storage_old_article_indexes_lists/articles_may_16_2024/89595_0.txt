of attacking Dorothy Holt, 14 years old,
daughter of Judge Charles Holt.

their demands for possession of the prisoners
that Sheriff Purcell telegraphed for
militia and Adjutant General Dickinson
and a company of soldiers were sent on
a special train.
When news came that the troops were
on the way the mob dispersed but soon
gathered again.
After the sheriff and his deputies had
made repeated efforts to drive away they
crowd, many went home, but more than
200 men, who declared they would hang
the prisoner, filled the streets with angry
shouts, surrounding the jail several times,
only to be driven back by the sheriff's
force.

To aid in preserving order, all
preachers and aldermen, and several
members, seized all the whisky and beer
they could find and poured it into the
gutters.

way home from a moving picture show
last night when a man seized her by the
throat, gagged her with a handkerchief
and took her a mile and a half out of
the town to a slaughter house. The girlgret
lost consciousness and remained in the
slaughter pen until today. She finally regained
her senses and walked home. She
is in a serious condition.

the girl to the slaughter house, but did
so for another man who promised him

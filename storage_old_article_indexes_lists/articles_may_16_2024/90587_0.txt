Another Colored Man
Lynched in Texas
Gilmer, Tex., Aug. 8.- In continuance
of the disregard of law and justice
and the gross cowardice of the cracker
element, who do not hesitate to congre-
' gate in hundreds and take one little
colored man out and lynch him, Chilton
Jennings was taken from jail here and
hanged in the court yard a mob of
crackers, numbering 500 men by.

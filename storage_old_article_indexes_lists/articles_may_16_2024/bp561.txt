Ly dear Gov. Sampson:
I'em writing you again concerning Buford Mundy,
10234, and I hope you will be kind enough to give me a
definito answer on my two questions. Can I look forward
to his parole Oct. 31? If not, will it avail me any good
to bring Margaret Sowers, the woman in the case, before
you and let her tell you personally the truth?
I am not pleading for a Negro who has raped a
white woman. I am pleading for an innocent man, though
he is colored, one who has served his country faithfully
and received an excellent discharge. And, regardless of
the man's colcr, he is entitled to justice as much as you.
or I.
Flease give me some definite answer yourself. I
am not addressing your secretary.

AFRO- AMERICAN POINT OF VIEW.
A. Sharp, editor of the Den ver
Times- Speaker," the only illus
Irated Afro- American newspaper
in the West," was in La Junta last
Tuesday and Wednesday investigating
the lynching of the negro
Wallace. He interviewed Sheriff
Barr and a number of our promi-
ment citizens concerning the lynching
, and it is hoped secured information
that will cause him to
modify to some extent the views
expressed in an article in his paper
of the 26th instant. Wallace was
not lynched on account of race
prejudice, and the least said about
that particular feature of the
lynching the better. Had the
same evidence of guilt developed
against a white man, he would
just as surely have met the fate
that Wallace did Race prejudice
cut no figure whatever. The article
in the Times Speaker, headed,
" The La Junta Disgrace," is as
follows:
" Last night the lawless citizens
of La Junta, and other vicinities
around La Junta, Colorado, took
the law into their own hands and
lynched without trial, judge or
jury, one W. H. Wallace, who
was charged with outraging an old
white lady. The accused man
was, of course, an Africanite.
And, in the event that he commit
ted the damnable deed charged
against him, he surely was deserving
of death. We do not believe
that there is a decent self respecting
Negro in this state that would
not, if on the juror's bench condemn
a culprit, whose guilt had
been proven, in a case like the one
in question, to death. Though
we are slow to believe that either
respectable whites or Africanites
are in sympathy with the actions
of Colorado's fiendish and cowardly
mob, who lynched and shot the
deceased Wallace. Such things
as this one has a tendency to bring
disgrace upon the liberty loving
state of Colorado, and in addition
breed anarchy throughout the
Nation.
Every county in this state should
always elect sheriffs who are law.
abiding and uncompromising foes
to mobs of any and all kinds.
The sheriff who gave up the deceased
Wallace yesterday, was last
fall elected on a Republican ticket,
and was sworn to uphold the law.
In this particular case he was a
complete failure. And, there was
no good reason for this failure to
land his prisoner safe behind the
bars of his jail, and there protect
him, even though he had to call
on Governor J. B. Orman to send
out the entire state militia to assist
him.
" We are sorry that Colorado has
again allowed herself to be disgraced
by a gang of anarchists and
cannibals, with a part of her officials
participating."
The criticism of Sheriff Barr,
accusing him of failure to do his
duty, is pure and unadulterated
rot, and the assertion that La
Junta" ailowed herself to be disgraced
by a gang of anarchists and
cannibals" is a gratuitous insult.
That Wallace was guilty of the last
assault there is not the shadow of
a doubt, and he richly deserved
the fate that was meted out to
him, whether he was guilty of any
of the previous assaults or not.
There is every reason to believe
that he is the man who has been
terrorizing this community for
months, and to the minds of most
people that of itself is at least
some extenuation for the action of
the mob. No one can defend
or
justify mob law, but there are
times when desperate conditions,
as well as diseases, require
ate remedies. desper

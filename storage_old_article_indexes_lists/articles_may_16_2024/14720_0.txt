Progressive Temple
By Covington Hall
( From the International Socialist
Review)
A negro was burned at Temple,
Texas, two or three months ago. The
victim had been accused of being the
principal in an atrocious murder, but
it is freely charged that the real instigator
of the murder was the first
one in the mob to apply a match to
the wood piled round the doomed
man, it having been rumored that the
victim had agreed to" turn state's
evidence."
He was hung to a telegraph pole
by a chain, and, on the wires supported
by this pole, is a sign bearing
the legend," PROGRESSIVE TEMPLE
."
Needless to say that Temple always
rolls up a big" Democratic" majority,
that it is a" solid Christian community
," is" dry" as a bone and is firmly
convinced that the I.W.W. is a most
" lawless organization."
We have had" some" lynchings in
the South during the past year. Over
in Mississippi a mob lynched a negro
because they" thought he was stealing
mules." The sheriff came and cut
down the body, but, finding the county
had no money in its treasury to
bury it, hung it to the tree again in
order to force the negroes to bury it.
Again, over in Mississippi, a young
negro farmer, working out in his barn,
heard his 17- year- old sister screaming
for help. He rushed into the
house, found two drunken white men
asaulting her, attacked them, and, in
the ensuing struggle, killed one of
them and badly wounded the other.
Then, recognizing that he was in a
highly Christian White Supremacy
community, a community that would
not stand for a" nigger" killing a
" white man," he fled. The mob gathered
and, failing to find him, TOOK
OUTRAGED GIRL OUT AND
THE LYNCHED HER!
Down on the border recently those
noble" preservers of lawanorder," the
infamous Texas Rangers, posed before
a camera, showing themselves dragging
down the public road, behind
their horses, the bodies of two Mexi-
cans- the bodies being at the end of
ropes, the ropes around the necks of
the dead. The capitalist- Democratic
press explained that" the Rangers did
not actually thus drag the dead, but
just POSED as so doing to please
a moving picture man." But these
photographs were then taken, put on
postal cards and circulated all over
northern Mexico. Of course we Socialists
are" liars" when we assert
that this was done to anger Mexicans
to raid Texas in attempts to avenge
the hideous insult, for is not the government
of Texas composed of the
finest specimens of" Supreme Whites"
on earth," Christian gentlemen" who
can do no wrong? Also, it is" infamous
" to say that back of the promotion
of these" bandit raids" stands
the oil, mining, railroad and lumber
kings of the" great United States of
North America," for they are not in
the least interested in intervention
Mexico. in
Still, back of ALL these lynchings,
with few exceptions, stands the
mighty law of ECONOMIC DETERMINISM
. For the lynchings fan race
hatred into flame, and race hatred
divides the WORKERS against each
other and, divided, they fall easy
prey to the" Christian gentlemen to
whom God in his infinite wisdom has
the business interests of this
nation confided."
Industrial Democracy!
Death to Capitalism! Long Live

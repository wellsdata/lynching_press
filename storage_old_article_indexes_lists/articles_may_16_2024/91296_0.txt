Lynching of the Murderers.
A telegram from Louisville gives further
particulars in connection with the hanging

after 2 o'clock Friday morning, the mob,
numbering about fifty men, on horseback
and on foot, on entering Charlestown, broke
open the blacksmith shop and supplied
themselves with sledge hammers, chisels,
& c., and then proceeded to the jail where,
drawn pistols, they demanded the keys
with of the jailer.

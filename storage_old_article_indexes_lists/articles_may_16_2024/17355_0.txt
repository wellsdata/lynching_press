Great excitement ensued. Threats
of
mob violence and Lynch law were circulated
, but no unlawful demonstrations made.
A petition was gotten up by the mob, and
signed by three or four hundred names, re-
questing the officers in command at the fort
to give up the prisoner, promising to give
him the benefit of an impartial trial by
jury. The petition was not acceded to, and
prisoner was still confined in the guard-
the house at the time our informants left.

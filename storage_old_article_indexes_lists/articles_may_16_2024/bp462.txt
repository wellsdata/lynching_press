hardly assault a white man unless
goaded on beyond the point of hu-
man endurance. The burden of
guilt is always, imposed upon the
weaker vessel. The wolf above al-
ways blames the lamb for muddy-

This is not said, however, to jus-
tify or condone the Negro criminal
The criminal record of the race is
alarmingly high, even after we
have made every allowance for in-
justice and discrimination. This
criminal tendency is more glaring
in the North, 'where the courts are
presumably fair, than in the South.
The criminal record of the Negro
a standing menace to the commun-
ity for which white and black are
alike responsible. The Negro is sup-
pressed below the level of decent
human existence and reduced to a
status where vice and crime breed
and fester. For this the whites are
chiefly responsible, for they control
the industrial, political and social
machinery .which keeps the Negro
in a status of comparative ignor-|
ance and poverty-the feeding
ground of vice and crime. The
whites are also in control of the
Government and of the courts of
law, and thus it becomes their
bounden duty to encourage all the
people along the lines of good citi-
zership. The Negro has no gov-
eramental or constituted authority
over his own race. It is only the
bond of blood and ties of sympathy
that actuate him to voluntary ad-
vice and counsel of good behavior.
Upon the Negro teacher, preacher,
editor and general leader devolves
a heavy, though a voluntary, re-

sponsibility. Those who assume
authority cannot
throw their whole responsibility
upon Negro Teadership, deprived of
power to enforcea good counsel and

The Negro finds himself in a' sit-

confronted the Jew under Roman
over-lordship when Jesus uttered
His Sermon on the Mount. His
advice to His Hebrew. fellow-suf-
ferers was based on practical pru-
dence and salutary caution. "Agree
with thine adversary quickly while
thou art in the way of him. If
thine enemy compel thes to go with
him one mile, go with him rwain.
If he take away thy coat let nim
have thy cloak also." Unless the
Tebrew peasant thus conducts him
self, at the behest of the Roman of-
Acer, he would, deliver him to the
Judge, who would cast him into.

be released until he had. paid his
utmost farthing. The Negro in the
South, out of a self-protecting can-
tion, had better agres quickly with
an officer of the law when ne is
in the way with him, else ne runs
the risk, not only of being cast into
prison, but lynched on the nearest
tree or lamp poot, after which there !sponsibility
is no recourse.
The whites, who hold all vower
in their hands, should, use every
kindly endeavor to persuade and
convince the Negro of the benficent
purpose and function of the law,
that it is calculated to protect
safeguard their interest and well-
being, and not inerely as a means
of humiliating and degrading them,
Too often the policemans' club is
the only instrument of the law with
which the Negro comes into con-
tact. This engenders in him a dis-
trust and resential attitude toward
all public authorities and law offi-|
cera. None can doubt that such
a kindly attitude would go far to
convince the Negro of the value to
himself and advantage of law obedi-
ence and good citizenship.

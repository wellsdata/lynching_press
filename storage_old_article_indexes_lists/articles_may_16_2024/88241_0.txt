LYNCHING.
Reference was made in these columns
a few days ago to the encouraging
decrease in the number of
lynchings, as shown by the statist: es
for 1907. The decrease is in itself
cause for congratulation. But a

statement reveals some facts
that should bring us to serious
thought. It appears that the crime
usually associated with lynching in
the public mind had comparatively
small place among the causes of this
type of lawlessness in the last year.
If the statement from which we get
information be correct, many lynchings
were not the result of rape;
some were for such comparatively
trivial things as non- payment of
debt and fighting. And at least two
persons, one of whom was a woman,
were lynched for no other reason
than they were related to the
real criminal that.

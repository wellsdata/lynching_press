HILE American soldiers are dying in France in the battle for democracy
the lawless element in the, by continuing to practice its
pastime of murdering Negroes, is South lending weight to the arguments
of this nation's enemies, who question the sincerity of America's stand on
the side of liberty and freedom.
In the last few days four colored men and one woman, suspected of
complicity in the murder of a white farmer, have been put to death by
citizens of Valdosta, Ga. True to the spirit of mob rule, the men and the
woman were slain without any form of trial, and except in one instance
were taken from the custody of officials, who either were helpless against
or sympathetic toward the rioters' lust for blood. The body of the last
victim of lynch law was tied to an automobile and dragged thru the streets
of the town.
The Negro problem of the South is a difficult one, and not easy to
understand in all its angles from a distance; but the most ardent champions
of the cause of the whites, if they are of ordinary intelligence, will
hardly venture to assert that lynching presents the solution of the difficulty
. The Valdosta horror not only affords an opportunity for the enemies
of America to sneer at the justice of her cause, but it must bring a feeling
of shame to those valiant sons of Georgia itself, white as well as black,
who are fighting for freedom in France. At a time when dispatches from
General Pershing praise the valor of two Negro sentries, who by out-
battling an entire German patrol saved a portion of the American front
line, the information that in Georgia men and women are being murdered
without trial simply because they are of the same color does not make
good reading.
The industries as well as the good name of Georgia suffered as a
result of the Leo Frank outrage Repetitions of the Valdosta horror will
mean a greater shame for the state..- Denver Times.
THE LYNCHERS.

Not At All Likely.
" Do you think the widow of the
man who was lynched will win het
damage suit against the mob?"
" I reckon not," replied Mr. Gap
Johnson of Rumpus Ridge." When a
lady loses the kind of a husband that
a mob would nacherly lynch, she hasn't
lost anything. And when a gang of
prominent citizens take time from their
own business to lynch a cuss just b'cus
he needs it, it hain't reasonable to expect
' em to pay for the privilege of doing
the community a favor. That's the
gener'l sediment of the voters in this
neck of the woods, and I reckon the
jury, being mostly candidates for some
thing now or in the future, will
promptly decide to make unant

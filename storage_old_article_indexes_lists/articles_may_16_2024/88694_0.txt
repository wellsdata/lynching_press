DEATH OF WHITE MAN
Reports Indicate the People

to Round- Up the
Law Breakers
By Associated Press
Atlanta, July 24.- Berry Washington, 72
years old, negro, was lynched near Milan,
Ga., May 26, after killing a white man
in defense of negro women, it is declared
in a lengthy account of the affair
which the Atlanta Constitution will
publish tomorrow.
The lynching in the little Georgia
town in Telfair county did not become
generally known at the time, and according
to the Constitution's version of-
ficials at Milan said at the time that
they wished to keep the affair out of
print in order not to hamper their roundup
of the lynchers. So far as this account
shows, there have been
no ar-
rests.
On the night of May 24, the account
says, two white men went into the negro
section and began" cursing and disturb-
ing the negroes who were in their
homes."
In an exchange of shots with Wash-
ington one of them was killed.
The negro surrendered and two days.
later was taken from jail at McRae,
nearby, brought to Milan and
to a post and his body shot to pieces hanged.

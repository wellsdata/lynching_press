" The paper or the public
man who justly denounces
lynchings for an outrage up-
en womanhood without at the
the same time denouncing the
crime itself is particeps crimi-
nis in developing other emires
by falsely leading the negro
race to think lightly of this
fearful crime which bruitsh
negroes commit against white
women."

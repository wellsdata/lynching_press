What Do They Want?
" What information do they seek? Do
they want to know that the white people
in the South have lynched negroes
whose miserable lusts led them to the
commission of the black crime of rape
upon white women? If so, they need not
investigate, for such is the fact. Do they
desire to know that this has been done
by infuriated communities for the protection
of their white women and to save
the victims of these fiends from humiliation
from testifying in courts? If so,
this is the fact. Do they want to know
whether there was any doubt as to the
guilt of the men lynched? If so, for the
satisfaction of their yearning souls they
could have ascertained without encountering
the perils of a sea trip that their
guilt was clear in every instance.
" If they had desired to learn whether
these lynchings were permitted or countenanced
by the civil authorities they
could have learned through the regular
channels of correspondence that in every
case the civil authorities were either
without knowledge or were overpowered
. In Virginia the authorities in
every case have asserted all their power
to suppress the lynching spirit, and within
the last few months I have protected
from violence with military, at heavy
expense to the state, three negroes who
were charged with outraging white
women. They had fair trials, were convicted
and executed.
" While lynch law is to be condemned
and every effort has been and will be
made to suppress it in the South, without
the advice of those would- be philanthropists
who have taken so much upon
themselves, lynchings will surely cease
when crime of rape ceases. These sympathetic
Englishinen might find missionary
work among the negroes of the South
in warning them against the consequences
of forcible gratification of
their devilish the lust."

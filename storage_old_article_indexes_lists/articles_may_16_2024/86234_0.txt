LYNCHING. DEFENDS WHITE
Dr. Andrew D. White speaks practically
in favor of lynching because of
the inefficiency of the law. He says:
" There is nothing more nonsensical
or ridiculous than the goody- goody
talk about lynching. Much may be
said in favor of the quotation of the
famous Englishman, Goldwin Smith,
There are some communities in the
United States in which the lynch law
is better than any other.' I have no
sympathy for the criminal. My sys
pathy is for those who will be murdered
, for their families and their
dren." chii

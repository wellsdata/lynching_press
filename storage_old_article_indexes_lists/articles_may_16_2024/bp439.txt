ACTION PREVENTS GEORGIA LYNCHING
QUICK APPEAL TO
LEADING WHITES
STOPS LYNCHING
ATHENS, Ga., Aug 6—(By T. E. Davis for ANP)—A
plan to lynch John Henry Thomas, 22-year-old alleged Negro
desperado, by a secretly gathering Georgia mob was averted
by the promnt and effective action of a local organization of
Negro citizens.
Thomas was ac-
cused of killing, with a piztol,
Charles H. Rice, Jr., white Alling
station menager, in an attempted
holdup at his Alling station. He
was captured near Winder, Gs., aft-
er attempting to escape in a stolen
car, and brought back to Athens
but was immediately rushed to At-
iants because of the tense feeling
here. As the scheduled date for his
trial, July 13, drew near rumors
spread around the city that a mob
was preparing to take Thomas
from the officers upon their ar-
rival here and lynch him.
The local Negro organization im-
mediately appealed to Circuit Su-
perior Court Judge Bianton Fort-
son, leading candidate for the state
governorship, Solicitor General
Henry West, who was prosecuting
the case for the state, and aine
other leading white citizens of the
city for the protection of Tenomas
during his trial. On th basin of
this appeal Judge Fortson, who did
not preside over the trial because
of his participation in the govern-
orship campaign, assured the or
ganization that "the defendant will
not only have a fair and impartial
trial but also will be protected
from bodily harm by persons out
side the realm of the law even to
the extent of calling out the state
militia."
At the request of the Negro or-
ganization, Judge Fortson appealed
to Governor Talmadge who ordered
two companies, 150 strong, of the
Georgia National Guard to escort
Thomas to Athens and to guard
him during the trial. Thomas, for
whom the state appointed five of
the city's leading lawyers including |
a state senator, was found guilty
without A recommendation for
mercy and sentenced to death by
electrocution on August 6.
After the trial the guardsmen
secretly rushed Thomas out of the
courthouse and sped away with him
to Atlanta On the morning of the
trial groups of whites attempted to
gather near the scene of the tria!!
but were quickly dispersed by the
iocal police. A large crowd was on
hand during the trial but the pres-
ence of the guardsmen prevented
any display of feeling against the
condemned Negro.

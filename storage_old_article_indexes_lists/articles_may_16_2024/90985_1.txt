Several Colored persons at the time
saw the white gentleman while he
was in the act of shooting the Color-
ed woman, and in time he was arrested
, he had his trial continued from
time to time, in the meantime two Colored
men the main witnesses against
him had been mobbed and lynched for
insulting not assaulting a real white
lady, and finally when the Colored
mail carrier had his day in court, the
Judge and Jury decided that" the
white Christian gentleman was not
guilty of committing any crime, that
he had been grossly insulted by the
Colored woman; that he was justified
in murdering her in order to teach other
Colored men and women to keep in
their place and not attempt to put
themselves social equality with
white ladies on and gentlemen.

AGONY OF THE VICTIM
INCREASES MOB'S FURY
Negro Woman is Captured in a Hay
Loft and Swung to Tree by Enraged
Citizens- Suspected
of Another Murder.
New Orleans, July 26.- A special to the
Picayune from Shreveport says:
News reached Shreveport today that
the negress Jennie Steer, who administered
poison in a glass of lemonade to
Lizzie Dolan, the 16- year- old daughter
of John Dolan, from the effects of which
she died, was lynched by an infuriated
mob about sundown last night. The
lynching occurred on the Beard plantation
, near the spot where the woman's
crime was committed.
Jennie Steer was stubborn to the last,
denying her crime. But the proof
against her was direct and conclusive
and precluded the possibility of her innocence
.
It is claimed that the negress fled from
the Dolan household as soon as she discovered
that her crime was known. She
was pursued by a posse who found her
crouching in a hayloft. She refused to
come out and had to be dragged from
the place. Asked why she had poisoned
Miss Dolan, the negress indignantly denied
the commission of the crime. She
was taken to the Dolan homestead and
indentified as the woman who had
fully placed the poison in the lemonade.

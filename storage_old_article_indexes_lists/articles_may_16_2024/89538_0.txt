Coroner's Finding in the Vincennes Lynching.
Coroner Cooper, of Knox county, in the case
of Holly Epps, has made a finding" that said
deceased came to his death by hanging, having
been taken from the jail of Knox county, Indi-
ana, by a mob of masked men, and hung to a
tree in the court- house- yard of Knox county. I
further find that the hanging of Epps by said
mob was unlawful and wrong, and their act
ought to receive the condemnation of all fair
minded, good and law- abiding citizens instead
their approval." of

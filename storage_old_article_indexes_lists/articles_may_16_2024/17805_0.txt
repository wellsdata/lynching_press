Idaho Man Who Lives in Utah Sentenced to
Wyoming Pen.
At Rawlins Friday Judge Craig sentenced
James Caldwell of Idaho to ten
years in the penitentiary for rape.
Caldwell is a married man and his wife
and children are now residents of Vernal
, Utah.
Caldwell's victim is the fourteen
year- old daughter of a ranchman living
near Baggs, Wyo. Caldwell met the
child near the ranch and used a gun
to compel her to submit to his desires.
A posse arrested the fiend and he was
taken to Rawlins, where a mob gath-
ered to lynch Caldwell. Being assured
that he would be severely punished if
convicted, the mob permitted the law
to take its course.
It is asserted that had Caldwell been
given less than ten years he would
have been taken from the officers
hanged. and

mob was told that the offi

mined act arrested their attention
for the moment, and the mayor
made the commonsense suggestion
that he would 'phone to the chief
of police in the town where the boy
had come from, and whom the lad
claimed to know well, and make
inquiries about the character and
the family and the record of this
boy. He did so, and the chief
police officer said over the wire:
"For God's sake, do not allow
them to lynch that boy. I have
known him all his life. He couldn't
do a thing like that. I know his
parents and all his family. If you
can save him until I get there, I
will bring a force of deputies, and
we will take him and fetch him
back home here."
But there was one brave and just
white man in Paris, Texas; he hap-
pened to be the mayor. He went
out on the square and said to the
mob: "We have already burned one
man recently here; If I can pre-
vent it, we will not burn another.
We will investigate. I want to talk
to this young Negro."
The mob
threatened him. He
went into the jail to see the lad,
who told him his straight and
simple story. The mayor believed.
It is not hard to discern truthful-
ness under such circumstances.
The mayor took a pair of hand-
cuffs and fastened his own left
hand to this boy's right, and said
to the mob: "If you burn him, you
will have to burn me: I will stick
right by him."
The mob could, of course, have
cut away the boy's arm to free the
mayor, but this brave and deter-
And after a lynching, even the
good and the brave are less liable
to act, because action then seems
so useless, while it is costly to the
one who dares to act. After the
lynching good men feel: Well, the
poor fellow is dead, and I have
everything to lose and nothing to
gain by stirring the matter up
again. And the public
on, abused and imbruted.

This South Carolina sheriff at-
tempted to protect his prisoner,
according to reports, and failed.
But it is only such stand on the
part of officers of law that will
finally make mob-action undesir-
able on the part of the mob.
some
On that same morning
white woman somewhere in that
neighborhood, but at least two miles
and a half from the nearest point
where anybody bore witness to see-
ing this stranger black boy, claim-
ed to have been assaulted. The
boy was picked up, a stranger, who
had been asking directions early in
the morning, who was poor and
destitute-very "suspicious," indeed.
His own explanations of his sit-
uation and movements meant noth-
ing-to a mob. He was jailed by
the officers: the jail was surround-
ed by the mob, and a pyre was
methodically being built simply to
burn him. Mobs never investigate;
they act unsympathetically,
brutally. They had just recently
burned another Negro in that same
town. for which burning, Paris, in
Texas, had become as well known
for infamy as its namesake in
France is well known for art.
simply pick up the nearest de-
fenseless person merely to quiet
public clamor and to stop criticisms
against the officers.
No wonder that the sheriff in
this latest brutality had to be
knocked in the head by the mob
before he would allow them to take
the prisoner out of jail. No offi-
cer with a bit of human sense
would ever allow a prisoner being
held on mere "suspiclon" to be tak-
en by a mob. The inhumanity and
the folly of mob-action under such
circumstances cannot be exaggerat-

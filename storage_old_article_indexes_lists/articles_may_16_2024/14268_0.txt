Patrol Salisbury Streets
Troops With Loaded Guns
Charlotte, N. C., August 7.- Tonight
three companies of the North Carolina
National Guard, one command from
Statesville, a company of infantry and
a battery of artillery from Charlotte,
surround the jail at Salisbury, while sentries
with loaded guns and orders to shoot
to kill patrol the four streets that flank
the prison. There have been threats and
rumors of threats all day and into the
night, but there has been no demonstration
- only the general feeling of disquietude
and unrest.
Crowds thronged the city's streets far
into the night, but it is believed the worst
is over.
George Hall, the ex- convict from Mont-
gomery county, who is supposed to have
led the mob which lynched the three alleged
murderers of the Lyerly family
last night, is in jail, and the plan to rescue
him from the of the law, rumors
of which caused clutches Governor Glenn to
hurry troops to Salisbury, has not e
rialized. The surviving negries Henry
Lee, George Ery and two women, re
safe in jail at Charlotte, and there is
no danger of lence to them. The special
term of rt, which convened to
try the victim of mob vengeance, acting
under orde from the governor will not
adjourn u every effort to convict the
leaders the oh has been exhausted.
The case is being worked up, and many
arrests are expected tomorrow.
The determined to push the
matter t the bitter end. The cases
against the curviving defendants against
whom true bi were lound were continued
until the regular term of Rowan
county court.
Long before the sun rose curious persons
went to the scene of the lynching
and cut off the toes, the fingers and ears
of the negroes who were hung to the
limb of the big tree on Henderson's baseball
grounds The bodies were badly
mutilated before. they were removed.

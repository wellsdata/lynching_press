Indianapolis, Ind., July 31.- The
committee appointed by the Indiana
Afro- American convention to prepare
an address to the public has issued a
statement containing a bitter denunciation
of lynching methods and
charging that a question of morals is
too often used as a cloak to excuse
these violations of law; it complains
of the violation of the United States
election laws by statutory enactments
in the states of North Carolina, South
Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi and
Louisiana," whereby three- fourths of
the negro voters of those states are
disfranchised under the guise of an
educational qualification," and protests
against the of trades unions in
refusing to action admit colored men.

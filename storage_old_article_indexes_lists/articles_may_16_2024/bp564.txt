CAROLINA DAILY RECALLS
Editorial, Written On
Fifth Anniversary Of
Crime, Reveals Facts
Columbia, S. C., Graphically Recalls to Memory Incidents
And Highlights of Brutal Affair-Doesn't Try
To Distort Facts.
"Screaming impotently into the night, the three-one of them innocent
by a verdict of a South Caroline court-wero bundled into waiting automo-
biles and then, just outside of the city limits in a little putch of woods,
they were shot to death-
And thus does The Columbia Record of Columbia, S. C., a
fearless organ of the south, and of more significance, a white
daily newspaper, recall to memory the damnable lynchings of
three Negroes five years ago in Aiken, S. C., in an editorial
entitled "An Anniversary."
The editorial goes into a detailed and graphic account of editorial goes into a detailed and graphic account of
incidents relative to the case,
mine riots Tennessee's and Colo-
rado's, this was the most inexcus-
able. It was not doce in sudden
heat and passion. The crime which
it avenged-the killing of the sheriff
in a raid on the Lowina≈Ñ home near
Monetta in whis" Annie Lowman
lost her life and Bertha Lowman's
unborn child cled-was many months
past. The second trial was actually
in progress and one of the thre
the mob knew, was not guilty under
South Carolina law, made and in-
terpreted by white South Carolinians.
That as five years ago. Two gov-
ernors and an attorney general
sought to discover and arrest the
members of the mob. Two grand
Jurics invtigated the slaying-after
& fashion. But to no avail. Never
has there been a rest made or an
indictment brought. Officially the
slaying remains the work of "per-
sons unknown."
And Alken in these five years has
done nothing about it though it was
and is particularly Aiken's shame.
Aiken, which alone could have done
something about it, has wanted to
forget, but in Aiken are some who
know and these can not forget.

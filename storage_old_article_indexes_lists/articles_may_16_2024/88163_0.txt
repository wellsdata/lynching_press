LYNCHING. A
A MOB HANGS HALF BROTHERS
CONVICTED OF MURDER,
THE MEN DIED GAME
The Third Man was Overlooked by
the Mob Authorities Surprised
and Helpless.
Fort Scott, Kan., Jan. 22. -George
Silbee and Ed Meek, half brothers, who
were convicted of murder here early in
the week, were lynched by a mob in
the county jail yard here Saturday
night. At a late hour their bodies were
dangling from two trees in the yard
the authorities having been so completely
surprised that no effort had
been made to remove the ghastly evidences
of the mob's work.
The two men, who hailed from Kan-
sas City, had been convicted of murder
in the first degree, their victim being
a young German farmer named
Leopold Edlinger, whose murder occurred
near this city in October last.
The murderers disposed of Edlinger's
pair of mules, one horse and a wagon,
in Bates county. Amos Phillips, an
accomplice of the two brothers in the
crime, was convicted of murder in the
first degree. The evidence showed that
the three men belonged to a gang of
thieves who had been regularly disposing
of their plunder in Cedar county,
Missouri.
The lynching was the work of a mob
that began gathering in the vicinity of
the purpose of the assembling crowd
seems not to have been suspected until
the jail was attacked. A barb wire
trocha that had been previously built
around the jail was torn down, the
heavy doors leading to the prison were
battered in and when the mob came
howling out of the jail with its intend-
ad victims the interior of the
place
looked as if it had been wrecked with
dynamite.
George Silbee, the elder of the two
brothers, defied his captors to the last.
He placed the noose around his own
neck and died cursing the crowd. Just
as he was jerked into eternity he turned
to his brother with an oath and commanded
him to" die game." The brother
obeyed, maintaining an outward calm
until he was jerked into the air.
Before this Silbee had shouted to the
mob in defiant tones that he himself
shot Edlinger and that Amos Phillips
truck him on the head with an axe,
He insisted that his brother Ed did
not participate in the crime.
" Be sure and get Phillips," the doomed
man urged. Then, shouting to his
tormentors, he bade them, with a curse,
to string him up. The vengeance manifested
toward the accomplice, Phil-
lips, was probably due to the fact that
Phillips, soon after his arrest, made a
full confession of the crime, though
when he was put upon trial he repudiated
his earlier confession.
Ed Meeks was equally fearless in
the hands of the mob, but he did not
manifest the spirit of bravado shown
by his brother. His last words were:
" Hang me if you will, but I did not
help kill Edlinger. George shot him
and Phillips struck him with an axe.
I did
"
The doomed man got no further in
his statement, for four or five men
had him by the feet, while others
drew the noose around his neck, throwing
the loose end over a limb and in a
,
moment he was strangling to death.
JAILERS HIDE PHILLIPS.
When finally satisfied with their vengeance
upon the two brothers, the leaders
of the mob went back to the jail
in search of old man Phillips. In the
meantime the jail- keepers had secreted
him in a room in the rear of the structure
, and when the lynchers came back
they were told that Phillips had been
hurried away. After a brief search the
lynchers seemed satisfied with this explanation
and left the scene, thus sparing
the life of the third murderer.
Phillips wil Iprobably be taken out of
the city. There is some question as to
the old man's sanity.
The direct cause of the lynching was
a vicious attack by Silbee and Meeks
upon Deputy Sheriff Behmer, who
went to their cell to inspect the cage.
Behmer then discovered that the convicts
had sawed the hinges of the cell
door all but off. He entered the cage
to remove the prisoners into another
cell, and as he did so was felled by
Silbee with an iron bar which the
prisoners had secreted. Other deputies
came to Bermer's rescue and in
the scrimmage fired several shots at the
convicts. One bullet took effect in Sil-
bee's leg.
This shooting attarcted a crowd, wild
stories of the assault were soon in circulation
among the crowd which gathered
around the jail and it only required
the few leaders who came later
to incite the gathering to violence,
After the assault upon Deputy Behmer,
Silbee and Meeks were shackled, and
the irons were still upon them as
were swung to their death. they

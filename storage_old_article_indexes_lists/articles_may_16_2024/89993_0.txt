gro, broke into the house of an old white
lady named Mrs. Galves. She and her two
daughters fled from the house, followed by
Simpson. The old lady was overtaken and
killed with a club. The girls escaped unhurt
to a neighbor's. Simpson then went to
Miles Brown's house, a near neighbor, drove
him out and took possession. Simpson fortified
himself in the house, which was guarded
until Henderson officers arrived, battered
down the door and arrested Simpson, who
was taken to that place and jailed. He
feigns insanity and is quite violent. There
is talk of lynching, but all is quiet to- night.
LATER.- Information received announces
the lynching of the negro.
A safe at the town of Cairo, Henderson
County, was blown open this morning, and
$ 1,500 in money, besides notes and checks
were taken.,

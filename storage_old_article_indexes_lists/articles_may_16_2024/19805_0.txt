We published a paragraph some days ago
from the St. Louis Christian Advocate, stating
that the report that the Rev. Mr. Bewley
had been hung in Texas for abolitionism, was
incorrect. He was under arrest, but still living
. The St. Louis News, of the 12th, learns
that Mr. B. was taken to Fort Worth, tried
by a mob and hung! It will be recollected
that Mr. Bewley was a devoted Methodist
Minister who was put under the ban by the
pro- slavery ruffians of Texas, that he escaped
from Texas to Missouri, but was subsequently
captured in the lower part of the State and
taken back. A correspondent of the News
in Crawford county, Mo., who knew Mr. Bew-
ley well, states that he was Anti- Slavery in
his views, but an honest, sincere, humble
devoted Christian. Such is the" Barba-
and rism" of American Slavery.

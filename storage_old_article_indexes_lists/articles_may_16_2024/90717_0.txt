THE TOLL OF LYNCHERS.
--
The record number of mob
murders since 1901- and nearly
all of the victims were Negroes
-occurred during the
year 1909. From our incomplete
records we have eighty three Ne-
groes and eleven white men murdered
by mobs during, the last
twelve months.
A glance at these disgraceful
outbreaks indicates that a small
percentage of the Negroes lynched
are even charged with the un.
mentionable crime. There were
18 lynchings due to this cause,
murder, 13, killing an arresting
officer, 6, attacks, 6, shooting
white man, 9, insulting white
girl, 3, attacking officer, 3, and
one each for fifteen other causes.
Of the eleven white men lynched
one was for shooting an officer
and the other ten for murder.
The fiendish rampage at Cairo.
Illinois. in November, when a
Negro was burned at a stake and
a white man strung up, and a
similar murder in Missouri, were
the only lynchings north of the
Ohio River during the year. By
States the Negro lynchings oc.
curred thus: Georgia, 13, Texas

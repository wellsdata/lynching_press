REVIVING HAPPY CUSTOMS.
Lawton, Oklahoma, added something to the literature of
anarchy the other day by lynching a negro, after which his body
was dragged through the streets of the town hitched to an
automobile. This is a revival of a happy custom that used to
please the citizens of Rome. They adopted the frivolity perhaps
from the Assyrians. The Greeks practiced it at times with
manifestations of delight. Of course they had nothing more
than horse- drawn vehicles, and modern America is entitled to
the credit of first using the automobile. In the olden times it
was the custom to" snake" the vanquished commander of the
enemy through the business district, this being regarded as a
lesson in patriotism, and it deeply stirred the emotions of the
best citizens, so that the soldiery never lacked' for cordial sup
port.
Lawton used the method as a crime deterrent and a lesson
on the necessity of obedience to law, and of impressing upon
the minds of the little girls and boys who saw the dead negro
being dragged through the streets that the law must be held
in the highest reverence. But will some of them, as they grow
older, be pestered with the thought that perhaps their parents
were a bit headstrong in taking from the highest county officer
a man who had not been convicted, who had not had his
day in court, who had not been heard by a jury of his peers, who
had not been permitted to face his accusers, and who was deprived
of the benefit of the humane and just axiom that every
man is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty? Will
there germinate in their minds a lack of faith in the courts and
in peace officers and even in the substantiality and desirability
of the American form of government. And how deep will be
their respect for their own community? -Tacoma News

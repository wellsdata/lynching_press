Lawlessness in Le Sueur County.
On Monday last REINHART, the reputed
murderer of BODELL, was forcibly taken
from the custody of the constituted authorities
at Lexington, Le Sueur county, by a
mob of sixty men, and lynched. A pain
fully interesting narrative of this outrage
upon law and order will be found in another
column. The conduct of the mob was brutal
in the extreme, and has disgraced not
only the people of Le Sucur county, but
placed a stigma upon the good name of the
State which cannot be effaced for years.
The fact that REINHART was in close
custody, with no hope of an escape except
through the verdict of a jury, should have
prevented the commission of the cutrage.
As it is, the excitement consequent upon the
murder having subsided, the lynching can
not but be regarded as a deliberate act of
brutality, committed by a misguided and
ignorant mob. The people and authorities
of Le Sueur county owe it to themselves to
vindicate the supremacy of the law in their
nidst by meting out to the participants in
,
the disgraceful proceedings of Monday,
the most condign punishment. last

STORY OF
ATTACK
DENIED
White Woman Says She Was
Afraid She Might Be
Attacked
LITTLE ROCK, Ark., June 5-
(A.N.P.) Any strange Negro man
was in danger of being lynched had
he been caught in the neighborhood
of Mrs. Annie Jenkins, a white
woman, and all because in a fit of
nervousness she called the police
and informed them that she had
been attacked by a â€œstrange Negro." |
The call was received at the police
headquarters and circulated through-
out the city. Scores of armed men
rushed to the scene in the wake of
the two officers sent to investigate
the case.
The officers found the
woman in a very nervous condition,
got her description of the brute who
had "attacked her" and went to look
for him.

The highway was closely patrolled
by armed men and the surrounding
wooded section was combed thor-
oughly but no "strange Negro" or
for that matter any Negro, could be
found. After more than three hours
of diligent searching, the officers re-
turned to the woman to question |
her about the attack and the iden-
tity of the assailant.
By this time she was calm and in a
quiet manner told the officers that
she had not been attacked but that
while she was alone at work in a
barn in the rear of her lot, a strange
Negro came to the door, and made
signs to her with his hands, as if
he was deaf and dumb. Fearing
that ""she might be attacked," she,
upon the advice of her neighbors, .
sent in the call for the police, know-
ing that if she said she had already
been attacked she would be amply
protected, but she did not think of
the dangerous position she put every
Negro the neighborhood by her.

Defiant Lynches Negro Caught in Swamp
Governor Heyward Pleads With
Mob to Allow the Law
to Take Its Course
THE NEGRO BOB DAVIS
IS FULLY IDENTIFIED
Makes Murderous Attack on Miss Jen-
nie Brooks and Afterwards Outrages
Negro Girl 14
Years a of Age.
Columbia, S. C., August 1.- Within the
shadow of the home of his victim, Miss
Jennie Brooks, after having been identified
by her, and after Governor D. C.
Heyward, who, today went to the scene
of the trouble, had addressed the mob in
vain, Bob Davis, the neg who, on Mon-
day murderously attacked Miss Brooks
with intent to commit assault, and who
afterward outraged a negro girl 14 years
of age, was lynched tonight.
Governor Heyward reached the scene
shortly after the negro had been captured.
A platform was erected in a fence corner
on the premises of the victim's father
from which Governor Heyward addressed
the mob in an effort to prevent the lynching
.
The governor beseeched the mob not to
lynch Davis, but in vain.
At the conclusion of his speech, the gov.
ernor was vociferously cheered. The mob
then removed the proisoner from the view
of the governor, and within a short distance
of the home of his victim, the negro
was riddled with bullets.
The militia in that section of the state
is now encamped at Chickamauga, and
there were no nearby troops to be called
upon.
The Governor's Guards and the Rich-
mond Volunteers of this city had been ordered
to hold themselves in readiness in
the event that their services were needed.
The negro was captured in a swamp,
tied hand and foot and brought to the
home of his victim for identification.
When they arrived at the gate of the
Brooks crowd gathered
home a great
there.
" Let's wash his face, boys, before we
take him to the house?" said some one,
but the crowd was too impatient.
Four men were delegated to escort him
to the house. The young lady, lying on
her bed with a deep gash in her throat,
turned her eyes toward the negro as he
stood there between his captors, his hands
tightly bound with a rope.
" That's the scoundrel," she said." I
know him by his eyes."
The negro was removed outside the
house.
" Hear the governor," said some one, and
he began in his clear voice, a most impassioned
appeal.
" I know," he said," that nothing could
take place that could keep you froni
hearing the governor of South Carolina."
The crowd applauded.
" I come here alone," he continued," not
bringing any troops, only two newspaper
men with me, and they, as well as I, are
South Carolinians, just as you are with
like feelings. You are my friends. Here
I am not alone as your governor, but here
as your friends.
Governor's Duty.
" But it is my duty to enforce the laws
of South Carolina. Don't cheer, men; this
is solemn occasion, and I am very much
in earnest, and besides, I understand it
excites the ladies, and this is a consideration
that appeals to all South Carolin-
ians.( The residence was only forty feet
away). I come to appeal to your manhood
.
The question is, shall people be allowed
to be ruled by their passions and
prejudices, or shall the supremacy
and the majesty of the law be
upheld. I promise you, on my honor
that as speedy a trial as the law allows
shall be held. I would not object to cutting
the rope to hang that scoundrel,
viding the law says so." pro-
A few yards away stood the dazed prisoner
and men stood close about him with
rifles and shotguns in their hands.
" I am here alone." went on the governor
," but I represent the majesty of
the law; I represent the state of South
Carolina, your state and mine, and I say
to you, I beg you, I implore you in God's
name, don put another stain upon our
fair state. I plead with you to let the
law take its course. You have an opportunity
- a splendid opportunity to let
it be said that South Carolina leads in
this matter. Let us reason together: I
feel just as you do; I have lived in the
country and realize the dangers to which
our women are constantly exposed, but
there is something higher than the wreaking
of vengeance on that black devil and
flend of hell. You won't enjoy it tomorrow
when you look back upon it all."
Here the men came up to the stand and
said:
" We appreciate what you say but we're
not going to do it. We have stood this
thing long enough."
Many shouted for the governor to go
on and he concluded his fruitless
to prevent the lynching. appeal

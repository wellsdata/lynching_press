OW THAT THE
question of lynch- the
ing in the South is
removed from the
realm of practical as
politics it may be
worth while to turn
of
our attention to it
for a serious study.
It is asserted that
negroes are lynched
in the South because
they are black. It is asserted
that, as a fact, the South is yet in a
state of partial barbarism; that it condones
murder and of lynch
approves
.
no
ing, which gratifies passion and saves
the expense of courts and prisons.
Is this a fact? Certain it is that
lynching is too common in the South,
and for that matter throughout the he
whole nation, I would distinctly say
that I believe that lynching is in every
sense a disgrace to a civilized nation.
The uncertainty that attends such execution
is a horror inexpressible.
The possibility of murdering an in- it
nocent man through the passion of a
mob sends a chill to the heart of humanity
. But as for that matter, the
possibility of a legal execution of an
innocent man is likewise an unspeakable
horror. And there is just about
as much ancertainty attending legal
executions as upon the average execution
by lynch law in the South. If we
take such a case as that of Carlyle W.
Harris, who has been sentenced to
death, having been duly convicted by
a jury, we have a fair illustration of
the fact that with all the possible
light thrown upon such cases, by long
delay and the most careful judicial investigation
, there is still an element of
great uncertainty. Whether this young
man is guilty or not the world does
not know; and how a jury could agree
upon the evidence in the case I for one
do not see.
For this reason among others I might
say in the beginning that I do not believe
in capital punishment. I do not
believe that it is the true remedy for
homicide.
We have in America on an average
two hundred lynchings every year and
about one hundred legal executions.
The majority of these lynchings are in
the South -- perhaps 60 per cent of
them. This is an unmitigated disgrace
. It is a disgrace to the South.
It is a disgrace to the nation. It is a
disgrace to humanity.
But the question to which we address
ourselves is one that affects the
attitude of the races. Is it true that
the negro is lynched because he is a
negro? I do not believe there is one
I word of truth in the statement.
Negroes are not lynched because of
their color; they are lynched for crime.
Bishop Fitzgerald has well said, in reply
to this assertion, that" the white
man in the South who is guilty of the
same crime meets an awful doom as
swiftly as does the black man. It is
notable that in ali the spasms of indignation
against the Southern people
lecause of these lynchings no word of
sympathy has been spoken for the
white women who were the victims."
A Republican newspaper in the
West collected during the late Presidential
campaign the statistics of
lynching reported in the South for
ten years, with the following result:-

These statistics may be taken as an
of the facts. With this
a approximation
however, much
classification of causes,
allowance must be made for the time
for which the collec-

with the classification. For instance
is that twenty- seven men were murdered

of the collector of the statistics. That
thirteen were lynched for quarrels
with white men, it seems to me, is
absurd. That ten were

Windham, white storekeeper near
Duak Hill.
Among the first group of citizens
to denounce the mob's Bouting of
law and order. were 15 prominent
white women from all sections of
the state and representing the
State Council of the Association
of Southern Women for the Pre-
vention of Lynching. This group,
led by heroic, mob-hating Mrs. L.
W. Alford, gave a signéd statement
to the prem; it has a signed møm-
bership of 4,500 wonian in Miesis-
aippi and 35,000 in the entire
South, and represents the nation's
most potent unit dghting the lynch
evil.
The group, headed by Mrs. Al-
ford, also sent telegrams and´let-
ters to the Governor of Mississippi
and other officials demanding that

lynchers to justice, also gave out
this statement: "The executive
committee of the State Council of
Southern Women for the Preven-
tion of Lynching and all Christian
eftizens of the State of Mississippi
are humiliated at the recent crime
of mob murder in Montgomery
County. We believe such acts of
lawlessness are detrimental to the
government of our country, con-
trary to God's laws, and a hands-
cap to our mission work in other
lands."
From Clarksdale, Miss., Governor
Hugh White was sent a telegram
of protest by officials of the Wom-
en's Missionary Society of the
North Mississippi Conference,
signed by Mrs. H. L. Talbert, of
Clarksdale, president, and Mrs. R.
P. Neblett, the secretary. The
wire: The more than 5.000 mem-
bers of the Woman's Missionary
Society of the North Mississippi
Methodist Conference are shocked
and humilated at the brutal lynch-
ings perpetrated by the mob at
Duck Hill. We wish to register
our protest and urge a thorough
official investigation of the mob
violence and conviction of the
guilty parties."
In Washington, where the brutal
lynchings spurred the nation's
members of Congress to pass the
Gavagan Anti-Lynch Bill on Thurs-
day, Texas' Democratio Chairman
Sunimers, of the House judiciary
committee, telegraphed Mississip-
pi's Governor White that the state
could not escape being an acces
sory to the Duck Hill lynchings
unless it brings "these lynchers
and officers to speedy and ade-
quate punishment." Calling the
lynchings "as dastardly a crime as
cowardice could devise and brutal-
ity execute." Chairman Summers
deplored: "It is the sort of thing
which makes it hard for us who
are here trying to protect the gov.
ernmental soverignity of the
states."
Here in Jackson, liberal-minded
whites declared the mob's act has
placed officials in a hot spot, po-
litically, and also given the gov-
ernment a valid argument for Fed-
eral intervention in like cases of
mob violence.
By a strange stroke of irony,
while the lynch mob was active at
Duck Hill taking the lives of two
Negroes, another Negro, John
Ward, of Coffeyville, was being ac-
claimed a hero there and given a
purse by white citizens for his
bravery in saving the life of a
i white woman invalid, trapped by
fire in the County Home for the
Poor.

know the bitter, bitter emptiness of
Washington's expectation.
After nearly a year of investiga-
tion and hearings the State of South
Carolina has recently written finis to
the netcrious Dendy case and has
semi-officially announced that "re-
gardless of the evidence presented
the grand jury of Laurens county
would refuse to indict" the slayers of
Norris Dendy.
INDEPENDENCE DAY a year ago
Wednesday in Clinton was cele-
hrated with the lynching of Dendy.
It was the culmination of a long
smouldering desire to "get" the
Dendys (they were too prosperous for
niggers) and especially to "get" the
stalwart and independent young
Norris (at 33 years of age he had
not yet learned "his place"'.
The parents of Norris, Young and
Martha Dendy, started out nearly
half a century ago at a time before
the mills had been established in
Clinton and the hill billies" had
been drawn from their mountain re- |
treats. The Dendys started simply.
humbly, but with a desire to get
ahead, to rear their children with
best advantages that could be offer-
cd. The father was a carpenter; the
mother, a laundress.
They worked hard. They saved
their money. They minded their
their
own business. They reared
children, as they themselves lived, to
rtand on their own feet. To be men
and women. There were seven of
these Dendy children. The oldest is
a physician in a northern city. Three
are high school teachers. One is a
disabled war veteran now in a mili-
tary hospital. Another son. Robert,
is a government employee living in
Hariem. The youngest daughter,
Viole, and Norris were the only ones
to remain at home. All were college
trained.
The Dendys had Ideas. They be-
Heved that the American ideal of
getting ahead applied to Negrocs.
Booker Washington had said it did.
They believed that their respectabil-
ity gave them a measure of security.
They were not to be kept at the bot-
tom of the ladder. The father be-

Insult? Yes, but some people find it
easy to forget insults, when accept-
ance is balanced against life. When
a Negro strikes a white man in the
South, he knows what he is doing.
A white man had cursed Crawford
in Abbeville, years
years ago. Crawford
struck him full in the face. Craw-
ford was lynched.
When Lollis called him a "damn
black liar," Dendy struck him in the
mouth. He knew what he was doing.
But he was a man and he had been
called a "damn black liar." In the
South to call a man a liar is to
challenge him to a fight. That is the
accepted code. Only, it is not expect-
ed that the code be applied to a
Negro when a white man insults. But
the Dendys had strange ideas. They
did not believe in double standards.
They believed that black children
should be educated as well as white.
They believed that Negroes should
live in as decent homes as did whites.
They believed that Negroes should
acquire property, be independent, at-
tain respectability. They had strange
ideas for South Carolina.
True to

Dendy resented the insult and struck
the man who had called him a liar
-struck the white man full in the
face.
THEY arrested him when he re-
turned to Clinton and instead of
taking him to the county prison at
Laurens, they lodged him in the
flimsy jail at Clinton. Hearing of his
arrest, his mother and his young
girl-like wife, Amanda, came down
to the jail to see him. They were
told that Norris had been drinking
and had better remain in jail until
he became sober. Unaware of the
impending danger they returned
later in the evening with Norris' and
Amanda's children. As they ар-
preached the jail they heard Norris
shouting, heard scuffling and saw
people milling around. They saw
them bring Norris out and place him
in a car.

women rushed to the car and plead-
ed for their son and husband. They
offered to pay whatever fine was to
be imposed.

last they ever saw of Norris alive.

changed and stated: You have no

Norris stated he was not going to

in the hospital or hell. Then Ware

to go home and get his gun. Ware

and told him to shut his damn mouth

They convicted him in the local
courts. But each time he was acquit-
ted on appeal to a higher court. He
did not run away. He refused to
cringe. There was no fear in him.
There was only the grim determina-
tion to live as a man should live.
THE FOURTH OF
OF JULY, 1933,
brought to the
mob the long
awaited excuse for a lynching. On
that day Norris drove a carload of
Negro picnickers to Lake Murray in
a truck which he owned and operat-
ed. Another truckload was driven
by Marvin Lollis, a white man. Lollis
was working for one Pack Pitts, a
wealthy and Litter Negro-hater, one
of a clique in control of local politics.
Lollis and Dendy got to discussing
the relative merits of their machine,
arguing as to which could make the
best time.
"They weren't mad," a witness
reports, "until suddenly Lollis called
Dendy a "damn black liar" and Den-
dy struck him in the mouth." Now if
you know the South, you know that
it is not the custom for Negroes to
go around striking white men in the
mouth, especially in the deep South.

unions.
In the midst of the construction
r. Dendy received a warning. It
was an anonymous letter decorated
with skull and bones. It read:

you get. You better build up where

yours will die soon. We are only

see a nigrar star in his place.
Somehow Young Dendy didn't seem!
to realize just what "his place" was.
So he continued to build his home.
There was tension in the town. The
"best people" openly approved the
move. The mob resented it. Never-
theless Mr. Dendy went ahead. The
house was finally completed and the
family moved in. Nothing happened
then.
But the campaign to "get" the

revolver.
In the meantime that infamous resort for
all that is vile and immoral near the tunnel,
known as" The Farm," had been visited by
the populace and inmates warned to depart.
Later in the night the deserted place was
burned to the ground with all its contents.
Price, after his arrest, was taken to the
city jail and confined during the night, the
building being guarded against the furious
mob of citizens who loudly threatened lynching
. Indeed it is a wonder that the threats
were not carried out. The prisoner feared
this result and attempted suicide by opening
an artery in his arm with a piece of glass.
His condition was discovered in time to call
medical attendance, who saved the worthless
life, for, let us hope, a more just and merited
punishment.
On Tuesday the officers, fearing the
demonstrations to lynch the prisoner would
be resumed and successfully carried out,
quietly removed him to the county jail,
where he is considered safe. There is no
that any further violence will be
Probability attempted.

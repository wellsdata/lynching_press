In a Serious Light.
The report presents the affair in a
serious light. As a whole the Italian
authorities view the matter
of the
lynching as one of unusual atrocity
and without the mitigating circumstances
which had been urged in previous
affairs of this kind.
Dr. Hodges Was the Aggressor.
In describing the first affray, which
led up to the lynching, Marquis Ro-
mano's report states that Dr. Hodges
was the first to draw his weapon, and
that not until he had fired one shot
and was about to fire the second one
at Charles Difata, who was at the time
Prostrate on the ground, did the brother
, Joe Difata, fire his shotgun from
the store near by. This last shot, it is
pointed out, was in defense of the
fallen brother, and was not a
attack upon Dr. Hodges. wanton

No Hope for M. Zola.
PARIS, Feb. 14. There is little
chance of the acquittal of Emil Zola.
The mob would be ready to lynch the
jury, and the soldiers are much more
excited tnan they appear to Dis-
be.
like for secret trial, however, is increasing
, and should M. Laborie's eloquence
extort an acquittal, the government
is bound to fall, in which
case the army may issue a pronunciamento
. The chances are decidedly
against such an overturn, but there is
no lack of funds for a revolutionary
movement. The Jews are both frightened
enraged at their positioning
under and the parliamentary republic.

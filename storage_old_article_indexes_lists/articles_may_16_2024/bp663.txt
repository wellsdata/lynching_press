Afken, S. C., on Oct. 8, and lynched. The same night a Negro
was taken from jail at Dover, Tenn., and.lynched. Since the

An attorney of Aiken describes
the crime that led to the lynching
as follows:
"Sheriff H. H. Howard of Aiken
County, S. C., for whos. killing the
three Negroes were on trial, went in
April, 1925, with three deputies, to
the home of a colored-man, Denman
Lowman, early one morning. Sam
Lowman the father, had gone to a
mill to get some meal ground.

near by. His wife, Annie, was mak-
ing soap in a pot in the front of the
house and Bertha Lowman, his
daughter, was sweeping the yard.

"When the men – arking in the

Mrs. Annie Lowman, was killed as
well as the sheriff. The three
Negroes were arrested, tried, son-

evidence was found to be so faulty
that the Judge, on motica made by
counsel for the defense, dismissed
the case against Denman Lowman.
It seemed likely that a verdict of
not guilty would be rendered for the
other two defendants. This was
when the mob» epped in and lynch-
ed all three.”
Federal Law Desired
In this connection is is worth re-
calling that South Carolina has an
anti-lynching law and a favorable
record on lynching.
But the con-
clusion to which the National Ai-
sociation for the Advancement of
Colored People has come, after years
of appeal to State authorities, is
that the only effective machinery for
stamping out lynching in the United
States must be provided by an ade-
quate Federal anti-lynching law.
Such a bill is now pending before
the United States Senate. The meas-
ure is intended to assist the States
in affording to all persons within
their jurisdiction the equal -protec-
tion of the laws. The bill rests up-
on the clause of Section 1 of the
Fourteenth Amendment, which
reads: "Nor shall any State
deny to any person within its juris-
diction e equal protection of the
laws.' It provides for a fine of
$13,000 up ¬ a county in which a
lynching takes place, recoverable by
the family or dependents of the vic-
tim; it also provides for the prose-
cution in Federal courts of lynch-
ers and delinquent and negligent of-
ficers of the law.

It was originally introduced in
1920, reintroduced on April 11,1921,
in the House of Representatives by
Congressman L. C. Dyer, and passed
by th: House of Representatives on
January 26, 1922, by a vote of 230
to 119.
On January 27 the bill was refer-
red to the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee.

Anti-Lynching Bill Reintroduced
On May 6, 1922, a memorial urg-
ing the prompt enactment of the
Dyer Anti-Lynching measure, signed
by 24 State governors, 39 mayors of
cities, 47 jurists and distinguished
lawyers, 3 archbishops, 85 bishops
and churchmen, including 29 college
presidents and professors, 30 editors
and 37 other citizens, was presented
to the Senate by Senator Lodge
The American Bar Association, at
its annual meetins held in San
Francisco, unanimously adopted the
following resolution: "We find that
further legislation should be enacted
by the Congress to punish and pre-
vent lynching and mob violence."
On September 21 the bill was
brought upon the floor of the Sen-
at by Senator Shortridge, but
met a decisive check when a group
of Southern Senators
that the yowuld filibuster. In the
preliminary wrangle th. t ensued the
opportunity to ring it to a vote for
consideration was lost. Thus Con-
gress adjourned without any de-
cisive action being taken. It has
been reintroduced and is now pend.
ing before the Senat Judiciary
Committee.
The main objection made to the
Dyer Anti-Lynching bill was that it
infringed on State rights. It is con-
tended by those who object to such
legislation that the Federal Govern-
ment has no more warrant to step in
to punish lynching i:. the State than
it has to prevent or punish any other
form of nurder or any other crime
arson, for example. But James
Weldon Johnson, Secretary of the
National Association Jr the Ad-
vancement of Colored People, argued
at a recent Senate hearing that
lynching is not simply murder; that
it is murder plus something else.
The mob apprehends the victir.i
tries and condemns and then exe-
cutes him.
Moreover, he contended, even if ]
we define lynching as murder we
are still confront with the fact
that murder at the hands of a mob
presents a question which the States
have not been able to cope with. And]
that is why the Nationa. Associa-
tion for the Advancement of Colored
People is asking for the passage of
the Dyer Anti-Lynching bill.
Argument for Federal Bill
Anti-lynching crusaders place the
responsibility for the recent increase
in the number of lynchings upon the
failure of the Senate to act upon the
Dyer bill.
"It is now evident beyond argu-
ment," declared the Board of Direct-
ors of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People.
"that the States themselves either
can not or will not stamp out lynch-
ings. When the Dyer Anti-Lynch-
ing bill was pending in the Con-
gress, lynching sharply declined, ap-
parently because there was fear of
Federal intervention. This evil
which disgraces America before the
civilized world apparently will never
be ended until an aroused public
sentiment definitely serves notice up-
or. Congress that effective steps must
be taken to stamp out this crime."
The main attempt to justify
lynching has been based upon the
contention that only by the sum-
mary method of mob murder could
colored men be deterred f om at-
tacking white women. But the fig-
ures of the National Association for
the Advancement of Color People
show that ..mong the crimes thus
punished murder leads the list, and
that the alleged or real causes in-
clude the most irival offenses:
They point out that the strongest
rebuttal to the statement that "the
usual crime" that provokes lynch-
ing is that colored women have been
lynched. From the figures it is ap-
parent that other incident than the
so-called "usua¹ crime” from large
majority of the causes back of the
lynching of Negroes.

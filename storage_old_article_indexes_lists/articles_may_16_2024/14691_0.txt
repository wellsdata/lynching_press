SELDOM RESORT TO LYNCHING.
I have never known but
case
one
where negroes lynched a man; this
was in Mississippi; the victim was a
negro who had committed the usual
crime against one of his race. The
was quite" orderly" and
execution
business- like, resulting in very little
public excitement or comment. Indeed
, what seemed most memorable
about the affair in the common mind
of the neighborhood was a trifling
incident. The lynched negro had a
little mongrel dog. Late on the night
of the lynching a well- known white
man, pretty deep in his cups, went
stumbling along the path from the
village groggery to his home and fell
limp under a tree. Towards daybreak,
when the moon sailed high, he was
awakened from his stupid sleep by a
slimy tongue's touch on his face. It
was the negro's dog, and high above
him, dangling in the dim sheen, was
the stark negro himself. From that
moment the dog never forsook the
white man's heels, following him,
loving him serving him with pathetic
,
faithfulness, until old age kindly returned
him, possibly, to the company
of his colored master. Maurice

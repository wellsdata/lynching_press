" Our league, having foreseen the
danger when it held its convention at
Washington last week to' Make America
Safe,' besides having petitioned
President Wilson in Paris at the peace
conference, against lynchings in the
United States, now solemnly warns
the government, in view of yester.
day's Sabbath lynching of a colored
prisoner and attempted lynching of a
white mayor at Omaha, that Amer-
ica's influence for world democracy
the World War, are lost, civilized gov.
ernment is displaced by anarchy unless
mob- murdering of Americans
and security of life, supreme aim of
here ceases. Since police will not
stop it, we urge you to initiate legislation
to put lynching under federal
jurisdiction at this session.
N. S. TAYLOR, President.

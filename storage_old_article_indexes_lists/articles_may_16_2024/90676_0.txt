A SOUTHERN GOVERNOR.
If the south had a few more governors
who had as high an appreciation
of the majesty of the law as does
Governor Glenn of North Carolina the
wholesale lynching of negroes would
be greatly suppressed even though it
cannot be entirely stopped until public
sentiment undergoes a decided change.
In an address issued to the people.
of North Carolina Governor Glenn
calls attention to recent lawless
acts
by the mobs and declares that in the
future the militia will be instructed to
fire on the crowds when that step is
deemed necessary by the sheriff of the
county in which the trouble occurs.
The sheriff is instructed to use every
means in his power to arrest would- be
lynchers and when a jail is attacked to
warn all citizens If these de-
to move.
mands are not complied with and in
the event of an attack the sheriff must
order the militia to fire. Similar orders
were transmitted to the militia.
Governor Glenn declares that the
first aim of the authorities will be
along peaceful lines, but that there
must be no repetition of the scenes at
Salisbury, where three negroes were
taken from jail and lynched.
Particular warning is given the citizens
not members of a mob who collect
around the jails during the excitement
. Under
penalty of being
removed
from office every sheriff is instructed
to confer promptly with the
governor when rumors of a lynching
are heard so that troops may hurried
to the place of impending conflict be.

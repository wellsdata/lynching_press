Wilmington, Del., June 26.- The excitement
and disorder following the
lynching of George White for the murder
of the daughter of Rev. Bishop is
being kept up.
A riot broke out in the streets late
Thursday night between whites and
Negroes and for a time assumed serious
proportions. The arrival of
a
squad of police, however, quickly dis-
persed the participants. Two arrests
were made. A large gang of Negroes
which had been marching up and down
Ninth street were challenged by about
25 white men and in the battle that
followed a hundred shots were exchanged
.
A squad of police under Capt. Ev
ans and Sergt. McDermott charged the
mob. The Negroes and whites fled
but the police captured two Negroes,
Leander Moore and Joseph Shockley.
The policemen used their clubs freely
and in the melee attendant on the arrests
McDermott and Patrolman Green
received slight wounds. One Negro,
James Mercer, was shot in the head
during the riot but his wound is not
believed to be serious.
In a brawl in another part of the city
William Cramer, a Negro, was shot in
the stomach by a white man. He was
taken to a hospital in a serious condition
.
The leader of the party of Negroes
who were marching in Ninth street
Thursday night declared that they intended
to resent the attacks made on
members of their race Wednesday
night. They say they have been
abused and that they do not intend
quietly to submit to such abuse. They
say they have no sympathy for White,
the Negro who was lynched.
Five of Dr. Bishop's cows were poi-
Wednesday night by some one,
soned unknown at present.

Officers Prevent Lynching of
at Spring Green. Prisoner
Spring Green, Wis.- Prompt and decisive
action by the local authorities
Thursday prevented the lynching of
Thomas Balf, who is accused of Ã s
sautling Mrs. Edward Frank.
Balf, who was captured at Madison
Wednesday, was brought here at noon
Thursday for his hearing, and the
train with the officer and prisoner
was met by an enraged mob, which
only needed a leader to carry out a
lynching.
Balf spent most of the afternoon in
jail, and during much of the time
there was a crowd about the jail yelling
," Hang him!" When it
came
time to catch the 4:30 train, however,
the officers braved the mob, and then
they were forced to
run from the
would- be lynchers. The
and Balf reached the train safely constables.

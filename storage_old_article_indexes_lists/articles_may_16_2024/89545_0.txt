A Would- Be Murderer Lynched.
DANVILLE, W. Va., April 19.- On Sunday,
near Axton, a negro named Kellis Moorman, by
a forged note induced Mike Mahone, a white
man, to go to a neighboring house to play a game
of cards. Mahone took a small sum of money
with him, and on the way Moorman knocked
Mahone down and robbed him. Mahone was
badly stunned, but recovered sufficiently to tell
what had happened. A party of men soon captured
Moorman and lynched him last night
Mahone's injuries are thought to be fatal..

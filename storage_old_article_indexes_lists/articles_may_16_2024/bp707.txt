play the white men strong downtown.
Many have been seen automobile rid-
ing after sundown. Then they try to
travel in the best circles unmolested.
Many places a girl cannot work unless
of nearly white complexion, and then
she is subjected to the wishes and
passions of those men who have
charge of her. These statements may
seem absurd, but those who are famil-
iar with these things know and can
read between the lines and look. Two
or three places girls have been forced
to leave rather than participate in the
orgies after hours, or to ruin the
names of their mothers by allowing
themselves to submit to the vicious
passions of the would-be white lovers.
How a woman who is supposed to
be in a position as teacher in one of
the prominent schools in the South
can ride in a "Jim Crow" car and sit
up all night so she can join her white
lover in Chicago, who has traveled in
a Pullman sleeper, we can't see. If
Fiske can't give better account of it-
self we feel sorry for the school.
Why our young girls here in Chi-
cago will sell their virtue for gold
simply to gain clothes we fail to see,
but it is done. What are we coming
to? Recently at a popular dance a
certain young girl was ignored by a
set of young, manly fellows who are
well known in this city. Her reputa-
tion for loving white men came and
was known before she arrived. She
was made to feel uncomfortable and
she left. Several days later about 7
o'clock she was seen going down
Michigan boulevard in an auto, close
to one of her white men. Her own
race will be good enough for her and
others when the whites find no use for
her after her youth has gone. Then
she will come back to her own people.
But her desire now is clothes.

The graduates and students of Fiske
Â· University held a reception and dance
at Dreamland Hall last Thursday
evening. Visitors and friends of the
school attended. A merry waltz was
in progress when in paraded a south-
ern white brute and lyncher and his
mulatto lover. Right here in Chicago
and in the very midst of those who
denounce the way the white men
treat our women in the South-right
in the midst of the highest type of
young womanhood, they came and
sat and were UNMOLESTED. The
outrage! If it were in the very heart
of the South, where the young men
do not dare to raise a protest, it
would have been different; but here,
where common sense could have pre-
vented the ugly and disgusting scene,
those weak-kneed college-bred chaps
with their powder puffs and silken
hose lacked the first principles of
manhood. They were unworthy to be
called men. They lacked the moral
courage to dare to ask them from their
reception, these scurfs of the world.
Because she had attended the school
would not even justify the act. Why
should those who cane to spend an
enjoyable evening be forced to sit
through this disgusting scene, or
leave, as many did? All day Friday
the Chicago Defender received calls
over the 'phone, asking us to please
make mention that this wench had
dared to flaunt her low southern brute
before the faces of decent mothers
and sisters and not one word of prot-
est was raised by the educated (?)
graduates of Fiske. The school is
simply disgraced. Southern visitors
expressed surprise that no effort was
made to ask them to absent them-
selves. We are mortified that such
would ever occur in this city. The
Mann act, of course, has no effect on
the southern white man and his black
wench. In the South he parades when
and where he chooses, and no one
cares, for she is of black blood and
he is white. Now we have a new
phase to fight. A black woman who
will parade her white lover before our
very eyes voluntarily and seek to
flaunt her vice in our society without
a protest from the weak-kneed "Chol-
lies" with their diplomas is beyond
all we have ever heard of or seen.
She was one example. There are lots
more here in Chicago. Our attention
is daily drawn to mulatto girls who
care only for certain jobs because
they have white blood, and are forced
to sell their bodies to hold a job. They

ED. MAXWELL, the desperado captured in Ne
braska, a short time since, and returned to
Wisconsin for trial, had a preliminary examination
at Durand, at which he pleaded not guilty,
and waived examination. Upon leaving the
Court- room, the officers having him in charge
were overpowered and the prisoner was
by a mob and hanged to a tree in the vicinity taken.

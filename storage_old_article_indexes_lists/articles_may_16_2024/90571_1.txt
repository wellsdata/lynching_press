New Orleans, Feb. 28.- Betal, the ne-
gro who committed a criminal assault
on Miss Miller at Fenton, in Calcasieu

He was attacked yesterday by Esteve
Miller, the father of the girl, who shot
him in the thigh. The wounded man
took refuge in the house of a
negro
named Sol Thebodeaux. When the assault
on the girl became known a mob
formed in the neighborhood and started
out to lynch Betal. Sol Thebodeaux attempted
to defend his friend and was
shot to death by the mob. They broke
into the house where Betal was found
seriously wounded. He was taken
the bed and hanged to the nearest from tree.

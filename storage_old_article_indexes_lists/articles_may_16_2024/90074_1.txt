Duty Pointed Out
Repeatedly the attorney- general
has pointed out that Indiana law
requires that he proceed against the
sheriff, should local authorities fail
to do so. A Grant county grand
jury did not indict Campbell and
brought no action against any mob
men.
Today Ogden called into conference
his deputies, Merl Wall and
Earl Stroup, who went to Marion
immediately after the lynching.
The conference brought forth several
long distance telephone calls
and the deputies may return to
Marion, was said.
May it Take Charge

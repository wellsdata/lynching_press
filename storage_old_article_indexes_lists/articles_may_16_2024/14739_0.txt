Chattanooga, Tenn., Oct. 5.- Neal Smith,
a negro who committed rape and probably
murder upon the person of Maggie Hen-
derson at Cole City, was taken from jail
last night by 150 men and riddled with bullets
. Smith confessed, and was then mutilated
in a manner unparalleled in history
by the father, William Henderson, who
subsequently cut off the negro's ears.
He was then held while one of the
crowd pounded his fingers, joint by joint,
one finger at a time, until the hand was
a shapeless mass of blood and jeily. This
was because, in the struggle to subdue
Miss Henderson he had bitten off one of
her fingers. Each man then took a turn
at shooting at him, until when he died
he must have had four or five pounds of
lead in him. He was literally shot to
pieces, and the bloody pulp which only
an hour before had been Smith was
thrown into a hastily prepared pit of
brush and burned until not a scrap
of bone wood remained.

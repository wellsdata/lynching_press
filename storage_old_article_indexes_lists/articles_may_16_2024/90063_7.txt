Subject to Death Penalty
Declaring that participants in the
double lynching are subject to the
death penalty or life imprisonment,
Attorney- General Ogden sent Earl
Stroup and Merle Wall, deputies, to
Marion to aid local authorities in
steps for apprehension and prosecution
of mob leaders. An investigator
for the attorney- general accompanied
the deputies.
The penalties provided in the
law against lynching are the same
as those for murder. Witnesses who
made no effort to stop the lynching
are subject to imprisonment for
terms of two to twenty- one years,
the attorney- general declared ..
It was estimated some 20,000
persons
would be imprisoned or put to
if all participants and wit-
death nesses were convicted.

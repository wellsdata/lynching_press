DISORDER AND CRIME IN THE AUSTRALIA
GOLD REGIONS.- From Australia the news, via
California though no later is full and
, very in-
,
teresting. It shows that disorder crime murder
consequent
,,
and lynch law are rampant
,
as in the
gold regions there as in our own California and
,
that the" curse of gold" is the same every-
, where.
The two great depots of the mining districts
, Melbourne
are formerly called Port
, Philip in
the extreme southern colony of Victoria, and
,
he Sydney, the capital of New South Wales, about
: 700 miles to the north- east, on the eastern coast
of Australia. The Empire, of Feb. 23d, pub-
, lished in the latter place, compares the productiveness
of the two districts, showing that the
gold diggers of New South Wales
are procuring
a larger average of gold per man than those in
the colony of Victoria. In the latter the aver
weekly yield of gold was an ounce and a
quarter a week per man. In the former the
average weekly yield was more than an ounce
I and a half per man a week.
By the Sydney brokers' gold circular, Feb.
, 14th, we learn that the total export of gold from
, Sydney, to that date, was £ 819,953 15s. 7d.,
" and from Melbourne £ 1,071,879; making a total
from both
places of £ 1,891,832 or nearly
$ 9,000,000.

As to society, the Empire adds:
" The arrivals at Melbourne show a considerable
influx of

on the increase, and the whole state of society
there greatly disorganized. The miners are suffering
with sore eyes, and a horrible state of so.
a ciety prevailed in some places. Murders and
robberies were of frequent occurrence.
At
Fryais creek, a correspondent says quarrels, dis-
- sensions, bloodshed and danger of the direst de-
seription reigned supreme.
" The government is palsied, whilst the ill-
doer runs on a career of unchecked crime

So rampant was crime in Victoria that the
people resorted to lynch law, and several

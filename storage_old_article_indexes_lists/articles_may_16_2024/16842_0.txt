SHOCKING CASE OF LYNCH LAW.- On one of
these limbs on Wednesday morning last, a black
was hung! without any interference of law- whatever
may have been the enormity of his crime, or
the moral justice of his execution. We witnessed
the fact, accidentally of course and we cried to
the perpetrators- composed of white and black persons
, to cut him down; but our interference was
unheeded, and whilst one portion of the assemblage
held the rope, to one end of which was the dangling
and struggling victim, another caught hold of his
legs, and by pulling them- perhaps in mercy to his
sufferings- soon ended the fatal and inhuman scene.
He was accused, we have since learned, of murder.
The victim was white, young, and tender in
years, and of course incapable of molesting the unfortunate
deceased. As yet, no means have been
taken to arrest the authors of this affair- but
whether it be that the act was not of a description
to merit punishment, or that our local authorities
have not exercised proper exertions in the matter,
we leave others to determine- our province being
only to state the nature of the particulars as they exhibited
themselves to us.
P. S. To prevent our being misunderstood, it
may be well enough to add that the black was a
dog, and the victim a poor, inoffensive little
Centreville( Md.) Times. lamb.-

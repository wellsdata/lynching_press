The West Virgilla Lynchings Lynchings Virgilla West
The lynching of the two Negroes
at Lewisburg, W. Va., was a sicken-
ing and a disheartening occurrence,
following so soon the lynching at
Salisbury. Md. In neither case was

ancient dread of possible Negro
dominance never existed.
The Negroes who were lynched at
Lewisburg had been accused of kill-
ing two white men during a fight.
What the circumstances were, or are
alleged to have been, is not known
as this is written; but, in any case,
the men were in jail, awaiting trial.
The lynchers obtained the keys
from the jailer on demand, hanged
their victims to telegraph poles and
riddled their bodies with bullets. Al-
though none of the mob that went
to the jail was masked, the jail of-
ficers did not recognize any of them;

sence from town seems to absolve
him from responsibility for the fail-
ure to protect the Negroes; though
it is difficult to believe that the
weak-kneed conduct of his subordi-
nates did not reflect a contributory
weakness in the administration of
his office.
At the lynching in Maryland last

the victim, dragged from a hospital
cot where he was under arrest for
the murder of his employer, was
strangled to death by the mob, wit-

that keeps alive the serious pro-

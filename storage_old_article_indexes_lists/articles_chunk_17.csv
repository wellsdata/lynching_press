state courts to the United States supreme,89387_0.txt
court had been granted. This,89387_0.txt
"operated as a supersedeas, and the offense",89387_0.txt
of Sheriff Shipp and one of nis,89387_0.txt
deputies in permitting the lynching of,89387_0.txt
the negro to take place was ons,89387_0.txt
against the court of last resort. It is,89387_0.txt
not claimed that he was present at the,89387_0.txt
lynching. The charge is that he was,89387_0.txt
not at the jail and did nothing to prevent,89387_0.txt
the lynching. The supreme court will,89387_0.txt
on June 1 mete out punishment to,89387_0.txt
Sheriff Shipp. his deputy and four residents,89387_0.txt
.,89387_0.txt
The supreme court holds that the,89387_0.txt
mob hung a man who was constructively,89387_0.txt
in its custody. As soon as the great,89387_0.txt
court granted an appeal to Johnson a,89387_0.txt

"Washington, August 7 .-( Special.)-",89389_0.txt
When I think back over the later years,89389_0.txt
of my actual residence in Alabama and,89389_0.txt
recall myself as but little over 30 years,89389_0.txt
"old, I have a conviction that somebody",89389_0.txt

from Alabama now and then to write,89389_0.txt
something back to the home papers,89389_0.txt
on politics of the moment?,89389_0.txt
If it were proposed that I give The,89389_0.txt
Age- Herald a Washington view of the,89389_0.txt
political situation I should decline the,89389_0.txt
footless undertaking. It is a proverb,89389_0.txt
that Washington has no opinion worth,89389_0.txt
any practical man's considering. Government,89389_0.txt
"clerks hardly go nome, on an",89389_0.txt
"average, once in two years; their talk",89389_0.txt

", and which are now dead, all",89389_0.txt
of the issues and most of the men.,89389_0.txt
Congressmen spend almost a half of,89389_0.txt
their time in Washington. When we,89389_0.txt
listen to their talk we merely learn,89389_0.txt
what they think the country is thinking,89389_0.txt
. First- hand information of the,89389_0.txt
workings of the public mind is the only,89389_0.txt
kind that a live newspaper can be,89389_0.txt
"supposed to want. My business, as it",89389_0.txt
"happened, has taken me very often to",89389_0.txt
"Chicago and St. Louis, and sometimes",89389_0.txt
to St. Paul and Detroit for several,89389_0.txt
"years back, and what I offer to The",89389_0.txt
Age- Herald's readers is my experience,89389_0.txt
acquired on those travels.,89389_0.txt
Some three years ago I fancied that,89389_0.txt
I had made a discovery all my own,89389_0.txt
"in these middle western states, viz:",89389_0.txt
"that, outside the republican machine",89389_0.txt
and the few whom high protection,89389_0.txt
"enriched, the Dingley tariff bill hardly",89389_0.txt
had a friend. I observed with much,89389_0.txt
"Interest that merchants, farmers, city",89389_0.txt
"business men of all classes, indeed",89389_0.txt
everybody I would talk with on the,89389_0.txt
trains who had no peculiar stake in,89389_0.txt
"the tariff, was convinced that its rates",89389_0.txt
were unjustly high. The republican,89389_0.txt
leaders did not fall to take the hint.,89389_0.txt
In their national platform of 1908 they,89389_0.txt
put something that the country at large,89389_0.txt
construed as promising a revision,89389_0.txt
downward of the customs duties. In,89389_0.txt
fact after Taft's election they were,89389_0.txt
",",89389_0.txt
not slow in passing a new tariff bill.,89389_0.txt
But of what sort? The protestations,89389_0.txt
of the organization republicans that,89389_0.txt
the rates of the Payne tariff are on,89389_0.txt
the whole lower than those of the,89389_0.txt
Dingley tariff would apprise the man,89389_0.txt
from Mars that the people of the United,89389_0.txt
States believe that the new rates,89389_0.txt
"are the higher. Other conditions, too,",89389_0.txt
have conspired to make the people re-,89389_0.txt
sentful of republican lawmaking. Only,89389_0.txt
a few weeks ago a thousand or so car-,89389_0.txt
cases of Australian mutton were landed,89389_0.txt
in New York- un initial venture in,89389_0.txt
a business which has reached enormous,89389_0.txt
proportions in England. This meat was,89389_0.txt
sold in New York some 2 cents a pound,89389_0.txt
below the ruling prices of American,89389_0.txt
sheep; but not a mother's son in eith-,89389_0.txt
er house of Congress ventured to move,89389_0.txt
a new increase of the duty in the name,89389_0.txt
of the sheep industry of Ohio and Mon-,89389_0.txt
tana and Wyoming. If this had happened,89389_0.txt
four years ago the Aldriches and,89389_0.txt
Cannons and Paynes and Dicks and,89389_0.txt
Heyburns would have howled for a,89389_0.txt
higher duty.( Notwithstanding the exorbitant,89389_0.txt
protection of the Dingley bill,89389_0.txt
there are not as many sheep in this,89389_0.txt
country as there,89389_0.txt
were 10 years ago.,89389_0.txt
How many there will be 10 years from,89389_0.txt

"of the prohibitive order, God",89389_0.txt
only,89389_0.txt
"knows.) As it is, no republican oracle",89389_0.txt
is now heard to say that a cheap lamb,89389_0.txt
chop makes a cheap man.,89389_0.txt
If it were true that Aldrich and Payne,89389_0.txt
I have reduced tariff taxation and that the,89389_0.txt
republican administration in Congress,89389_0.txt
is guiltless of all the impositions against,89389_0.txt
"which the consumer cries out, it is nothing",89389_0.txt
to the point. The people at large,89389_0.txt
I believe that this Aldrich- Payne contrivance,89389_0.txt
"a"" tariff for extortion,"" but",89389_0.txt
especially is that if there were no high,89389_0.txt
| protection the necessaries of life would,89389_0.txt
be at reasonable prices. It will be,89389_0.txt
strange if these convictions do not speak,89389_0.txt
in the election returns of next Novem-,89389_0.txt
ber.,89389_0.txt
The most remarkable development of,89389_0.txt
these two years in the politics of the,89389_0.txt
"middle west, that probably which gives",89389_0.txt
the republican managers more anxiety,89389_0.txt
"than any other, is the popularity and",89389_0.txt
"power of Judson Harmon, governor of",89389_0.txt
Ohio. Let me now relate some little,89389_0.txt
facts suggestive of the strength of this,89389_0.txt
man in his own state.,89389_0.txt
"In September, 1908, I traveled from",89389_0.txt
Chicago to Washington in the same,89389_0.txt
"sleeping car with four Ohio republicans,",89389_0.txt
two being Cincinnati merchants( one a,89389_0.txt
"Jew, the other a Gentile) one a manu-",89389_0.txt
",",89389_0.txt
facturer of some kind of machinery at,89389_0.txt
"Columbus, and the fourth a business",89389_0.txt
man of some description from Spring-,89389_0.txt
"field. There was another man aboard,",89389_0.txt
"a democrat, who had moved from Cin-",89389_0.txt
"cinnati to Chicago, and seemed to be a",89389_0.txt
friend of the Gentile merchant from the,89389_0.txt
latter city. This friend was joking the,89389_0.txt
other about the probable prespocts of,89389_0.txt
the republican candidate for governor,89389_0.txt
"of Ohio, but finally the other put the",89389_0.txt
laugh on the Chicago man by saying,89389_0.txt
"he was going to vote for Harmon, and",89389_0.txt
that the latter would surely be elected.,89389_0.txt
The other Cincinnati man expressed,89389_0.txt
himself to identically the same effect.,89389_0.txt
The Columbus man said he was going,89389_0.txt
"to vote for Harmon, but it was not",89389_0.txt
clear to him how the election would go.,89389_0.txt
The Springfield man would not say how,89389_0.txt
"he expected to vote, but did say that",89389_0.txt
Harmon would undoubtedly be elected.,89389_0.txt
We know that Harmon was elected by,89389_0.txt
"some 19,000 votes, notwithstanding that",89389_0.txt
Taft on the same day carried the state,89389_0.txt
"by a plurality of 69,591. Last December I",89389_0.txt
traveled over this ground again. Among,89389_0.txt
the other passengers on the same sleeping,89389_0.txt
car there were again four Ohio republicans,89389_0.txt
". Three were lawyers, two from",89389_0.txt
"Cincinnati, and one from somewhere in",89389_0.txt
"the Cleveland region. Akron, I belleve;",89389_0.txt
the fourth was from Springfield and well,89389_0.txt
"acquainted, as it transpired, with the",89389_0.txt
man from that town whom I had met,89389_0.txt
the year before. I asked him did he,89389_0.txt
know how his friend voted in the end.,89389_0.txt
He said he did because they talked the,89389_0.txt
matter over several times and reached,89389_0.txt
the same decision: they would stand by,89389_0.txt
their party that time and vote the,89389_0.txt
straight ticket from Harris down. He,89389_0.txt
added that both are resolved to vote for,89389_0.txt
Harmon for re- election this I,89389_0.txt
year.,89389_0.txt
asked one of the Cincinnati lawyers,89389_0.txt
whether Harmon would be renominated.,89389_0.txt
"He said he was"" afraid"" he would be.",89389_0.txt
"Why"" afraid."" I inquired. He explained",89389_0.txt
that Harmon's victory of the year before,89389_0.txt
was a great thing for his reputation and,89389_0.txt
that he( the speaker) should be sorry,89389_0.txt
to see him risk a loss of prestige by another,89389_0.txt
race when the chances would not,89389_0.txt
be so much in his favor. I suggested,89389_0.txt
"that, whatever the temporary issues may",89389_0.txt
"be, no weak or unknown man could beat",89389_0.txt
a candidate so well known and so virile,89389_0.txt
as Harmon and I asked whom could the,89389_0.txt
",",89389_0.txt
republicans pick with any confidence.,89389_0.txt
The Cincinnatian admitted that this,89389_0.txt
would be a hard search. I next asked,89389_0.txt
what element of votes would cause Har-,89389_0.txt
"mon's defeat another time, and so felt",89389_0.txt
licensed to inquire of his vote. He replied,89389_0.txt
that he had voted for Harmon before,89389_0.txt
", and would vote for him again, no",89389_0.txt
matter whom the republicans might,89389_0.txt
nominate. In this declaration the two,89389_0.txt
other lawyers joined. I came out of that,89389_0.txt
discussion with a pretty confident belief,89389_0.txt
"that Governor Harmon, if he should accept",89389_0.txt
"a second nomination, would be gov-",89389_0.txt
ernor of Ohio until the end of 1912.,89389_0.txt
Now Governor Harmon has been renominated,89389_0.txt
", and by one of the most imposing",89389_0.txt
conventions ever held in Ohio,89389_0.txt
;,89389_0.txt
and last week I traveled across that,89389_0.txt
state again. There can be no doubt that,89389_0.txt
he will be re- elected by a greatly increased,89389_0.txt
majority. A clear enough sign,89389_0.txt
of this is that the republican chiefs,89389_0.txt
haven't been able to find any man of,89389_0.txt
respectable rank in the state who would,89389_0.txt
"take the nomination, except one or two",89389_0.txt
whom they could have no hope of electing,89389_0.txt
.,89389_0.txt
The fates have given Judson Harmon a,89389_0.txt
wonderful power to bring democrats into,89389_0.txt
"accord, as well outside as within his",89389_0.txt
"state. The fates, that is to say, have",89389_0.txt
given this man some uncommon opportunities,89389_0.txt
to demonstrate his unshakable,89389_0.txt
faith in some things that all democrats,89389_0.txt
profess to believe. There is no secret,89389_0.txt
"about it, except the secret that smaller",89389_0.txt
"men, no more and no less ambitious than",89389_0.txt
"Harmon, are slow to learn- namely, that",89389_0.txt
no public man( almost none) can go very,89389_0.txt
far on the mere profession of sound principles,89389_0.txt
". Harmon, in speech and action, is",89389_0.txt
simple and straightforward; but above,89389_0.txt
all the nature of the man forbids that his,89389_0.txt
action shall not fit his words.,89389_0.txt
There is a sort of family likeness between,89389_0.txt
Harmon and Governor,89389_0.txt
"Hughes,",89389_0.txt
though the Ohian gets the ear of independent,89389_0.txt
"voters, and thoughtful men of the",89389_0.txt
opposing party in a way that seems somehow,89389_0.txt
denied to Hughes. Each of these,89389_0.txt
"is the son of a Baptist preacher, and",89389_0.txt
grew up in a small town a stranger to,89389_0.txt
"all affluence, holding the beliefs of earnest",89389_0.txt
country boys that patriotism- sanity,89389_0.txt
"and justice in the making of laws, with",89389_0.txt
honesty in their administration- is a thing,89389_0.txt
"for active practice by the people's agents,",89389_0.txt
not mere copy book texts.,89389_0.txt
The country first knew of Harmon as a,89389_0.txt
corporation lawyer. This was when Mr.,89389_0.txt
Cleveland chose him for Attorney General,89389_0.txt
. But the country soon learned not to,89389_0.txt
expect him to be soft toward corporations,89389_0.txt
and combinations of corporations.,89389_0.txt
The most conspicuous achievements of,89389_0.txt
his administration were the decisions of,89389_0.txt
the supreme court in the trans- Missouri,89389_0.txt
"Freight association, Freight Traffic association",89389_0.txt
and Addyston Pipe company,89389_0.txt
"cases, condemning two of the railroad",89389_0.txt
"pools and the other, for the first time,",89389_0.txt
breaking up a manufacturers' trust. After,89389_0.txt
"Harmon was Attorney General, and before",89389_0.txt
he was named for governor of his,89389_0.txt
"state, he held two other conspicuous stations",89389_0.txt
". He was a commissioner, appointed",89389_0.txt
"by President Roosevelt, to investigate re-",89389_0.txt
"bating by railroads, and after full and",89389_0.txt
fair probing he declared that the Santa,89389_0.txt
"Fe railroad system and Paul Morton, then",89389_0.txt
"in Mr. Roosevelt's cabinet, had broken",89389_0.txt
"the law, and should be indicted; but the",89389_0.txt
"President would not have it so, and Har-",89389_0.txt
mon resigned his commission. He was,89389_0.txt
also for some of those years receiver,89389_0.txt
"of the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton",89389_0.txt
"and Pere Marquette railroad systems,",89389_0.txt
and his methods of putting those concerns,89389_0.txt
on their feet again won the highest,89389_0.txt
praise from jurists and financiers alike.,89389_0.txt
Appealing now from Ohians to outlanders,89389_0.txt
. I will give you a few expressions,89389_0.txt
regarding Harmon's qualities for national,89389_0.txt
leadership.,89389_0.txt
Alabamians know that few public men,89389_0.txt
served the cause of free silver in 1906,89389_0.txt
"so effectively as did Joseph F. Johnston,",89389_0.txt
now your junfor senator. He won his,89389_0.txt
nomination for governor by forcing the,89389_0.txt
free- coinage issue at a time when politicians,89389_0.txt
in other states were nosing in every,89389_0.txt
direction for the breezes of public opin-,89389_0.txt
fon. Senator Johnston has very recently,89389_0.txt
"said to me:"" Harmon would be a capital",89389_0.txt
nominee for President. Surely none could,89389_0.txt
"stronger.""",89389_0.txt
view from the opposite,89389_0.txt
be,89389_0.txt
"Now, for a",89389_0.txt
angle. Within 10 days I have talked with,89389_0.txt
a chief officer of a great railroad company,89389_0.txt
", who, beginning with 1898, has been",89389_0.txt
"voting the republican presidential ticket,",89389_0.txt
and who presided over a republican state,89389_0.txt
"convention two years ago. He said:"" I",89389_0.txt
should vote for Harmon against Taft,89389_0.txt
or Roosevelt or any other man the republicans,89389_0.txt
"might name."" Within this same",89389_0.txt
short period I have also had a chance,89389_0.txt
to exchange opinions with one of the most,89389_0.txt
consecrated among Bryan's friends of the,89389_0.txt
"inmost circle. He, too, spoke of the paramount",89389_0.txt
eligibility of Harmon. More than,89389_0.txt
"this, he said that if the sniping of the",89389_0.txt
Commoner newspaper at Harmon does,89389_0.txt
not stop. Mr. Bryan will hear something,89389_0.txt
not entirely pleasant from his most loyal,89389_0.txt
supporters. Of the other school again is,89389_0.txt
a friend of mine formerly of much influence,89389_0.txt
in the democratic organization in,89389_0.txt
Tennessee. I have seen him also quite,89389_0.txt
recently Sick of the democratic futili-,89389_0.txt
ties of. 1908. quite as sick probably of,89389_0.txt
the Patterson- Carmack feud in his own,89389_0.txt
"state, he said to me he feared he should",89389_0.txt
be driven into the republican party. The,89389_0.txt
"one thing, he added, that could restore his",89389_0.txt
hope of democratic success and nerve his,89389_0.txt
"arm for the campaign again, would be the",89389_0.txt
nomination of Harmon for President.,89389_0.txt
"Something, of course, must be said",89389_0.txt
of Harmon's performances as governor,89389_0.txt
- said with a consciousness that,89389_0.txt

"that had, in a party sense, acquired",89389_0.txt
merit. This was deemed,89389_0.txt
fair in those,89389_0.txt
times and it was amiably assumed that,89389_0.txt
the treasurer was not gaining,89389_0.txt
anything,89389_0.txt
for himself. Governor Harmon,89389_0.txt
had a theory of the law which required,89389_0.txt
that this should be investigated. The,89389_0.txt
"investigation showed that, while the",89389_0.txt
state treasury had received nothing for,89389_0.txt
"these large deposits, two of the treasurers",89389_0.txt
had received from the banks an,89389_0.txt
"aggregate, as interest, of some$ 325,-",89389_0.txt
"000. Harmon, over all manner of obstructions",89389_0.txt
"by republican managers, has",89389_0.txt
brought about the indictment of those,89389_0.txt
thrifty gentlemen.,89389_0.txt
The treasurers used to have something,89389_0.txt
of a free hand but years ago a,89389_0.txt
law was passed requiring that all state,89389_0.txt
"funds be deposited at interest, to the",89389_0.txt
"state's account, in banks, leaving still",89389_0.txt
to the treasurer almost unlimited choice,89389_0.txt
of depositaries. Naturally the banker,89389_0.txt
friends of the organization got the,89389_0.txt
large shares of the moneys and got,89389_0.txt
them at the very easy rates. When Gov-,89389_0.txt
ernor Harmon came in he caused the,89389_0.txt
treasurer( the one democrat elected,89389_0.txt
with him) to invite bids from the,89389_0.txt
"banks, naming rates of interest to be",89389_0.txt
"paid for two classes of accounts, recognized",89389_0.txt
respectfully as active and inactive,89389_0.txt
. It is not worth while to tell,89389_0.txt
of the appeals of democratic bankers,89389_0.txt
for favor in this connection. The result,89389_0.txt
speaks for itself. Under the rule,89389_0.txt
of the republican governors the state,89389_0.txt
"had received, as interest on the bat-",89389_0.txt
"ances of its check accounts, an average",89389_0.txt
of 12 per cent a year. It now receives,89389_0.txt
an average of 2 per cent. On,89389_0.txt
"the long- time deposits, comparatively",89389_0.txt
"speaking, the state now receives an",89389_0.txt
average of 3 1-10 per cent a year. The,89389_0.txt
best that the republican officers had,89389_0.txt
done,89389_0.txt
was something under 2½,89389_0.txt
per,89389_0.txt
cent.,89389_0.txt
Under a succession of republican governors,89389_0.txt
the public printer was able to,89389_0.txt
collect from the state treasury by false,89389_0.txt
"vouchers some$ 60,000. Governor Har-",89389_0.txt
mon dug up this fact and the,89389_0.txt
late,89389_0.txt
printer is now in the penitentiary.,89389_0.txt
To administer its many institutions,89389_0.txt
Ohio was a complicated and wasteful,89389_0.txt
system of commissions and the like.,89389_0.txt
Harmon has the idea of any other,89389_0.txt
good business man that if the functions,89389_0.txt
of these commissioners were centered,89389_0.txt
in one board there would be a,89389_0.txt
"large gain to the people, not merely",89389_0.txt
in economy but in efficiency as well.,89389_0.txt
"But the legislature, all the while, was",89389_0.txt
"republican; and, during two sessions,",89389_0.txt
the republican machine has in a large,89389_0.txt
measure blocked this dimunition of ot-,89389_0.txt
"ficers. So much the better, of course,",89389_0.txt
for Harmon and his second candidacy.,89389_0.txt
"This alone, no doubt, would put him",89389_0.txt
in the state house for a second time.,89389_0.txt
There is also an archaic system of as-,89389_0.txt
sessments and taxation in Ohio which,89389_0.txt
Governor Harmon has striven to cure.,89389_0.txt
"There are state boards, far too many,",89389_0.txt
commissioned to fix various privilege,89389_0.txt
taxes; and assessments and other tax,89389_0.txt
rates are governed largely by county,89389_0.txt
officers. Naturally there has been a,89389_0.txt
wide diversity as well as recurrent confusion,89389_0.txt
and litigation in the assessments,89389_0.txt
"and the rates. Governor Harmon, immediately",89389_0.txt
"upon his inauguration, urged",89389_0.txt
upon the legislature a system which,89389_0.txt
would make the law clear and prevent,89389_0.txt
these inequalities. The legislature then,89389_0.txt
dared to ignore his plan.,89389_0.txt
At the ses-,89389_0.txt
sfon recently adjourned the solons,89389_0.txt
yielded to the governor in a small,89389_0.txt
measure; they consolidated some of the,89389_0.txt
administrative boards and provisionally,89389_0.txt
"named a lower tax rate, which, on the",89389_0.txt
"fair assessments now assured, will undoubtedly",89389_0.txt
yield ample revenue.,89389_0.txt
Everybody in Ohio knows that what,89389_0.txt
Governor Harmon has accomplished in,89389_0.txt
law reform he has won from the fears,89389_0.txt
alone of the republican organization.,89389_0.txt
This is the reason that republican leaders,89389_0.txt
no longer expect to put him out of,89389_0.txt
office.,89389_0.txt

"has moved onward and upward, with no",89389_0.txt
man to grudge him a single honor which,89389_0.txt
"he has won.""",89389_0.txt
Governor Harmon's way of dealing with,89389_0.txt
the riot situation at Newark the self.,89389_0.txt
day was thoroughly typical of himself.,89389_0.txt
He had one of the most ungrateful responsibilities,89389_0.txt
that can fall on a,89389_0.txt
ernor; but he met it as a faithful governor,89389_0.txt
will. He concluded that he had the,89389_0.txt
power to remove the city officers,89389_0.txt
had failed to protect a prisoner against who a,89389_0.txt
"mob; and, having the power, he did not",89389_0.txt
shirk the duty. There is nothing,89389_0.txt
an,89389_0.txt
American community is more sensitive,89389_0.txt
about than the independence of its local,89389_0.txt
officers. I can well remember that the,89389_0.txt
late Governor Seay suffered to the end in,89389_0.txt
some parts of Alabama for merely writing,89389_0.txt
a sharp letter to a sheriff who had let a,89389_0.txt

The possibility of murdering an in- it,89458_1.txt
nocent man through the passion of a,89458_1.txt
mob sends a chill to the heart of humanity,89458_1.txt
". But as for that matter, the",89458_1.txt
possibility of a legal execution of an,89458_1.txt
innocent man is likewise an unspeakable,89458_1.txt
horror. And there is just about,89458_1.txt
as much ancertainty attending legal,89458_1.txt
executions as upon the average execution,89458_1.txt
by lynch law in the South. If we,89458_1.txt
take such a case as that of Carlyle W.,89458_1.txt
"Harris, who has been sentenced to",89458_1.txt
"death, having been duly convicted by",89458_1.txt
"a jury, we have a fair illustration of",89458_1.txt
the fact that with all the possible,89458_1.txt
"light thrown upon such cases, by long",89458_1.txt
delay and the most careful judicial investigation,89458_1.txt
", there is still an element of",89458_1.txt
great uncertainty. Whether this young,89458_1.txt
man is guilty or not the world does,89458_1.txt
not know; and how a jury could agree,89458_1.txt
upon the evidence in the case I for one,89458_1.txt
do not see.,89458_1.txt
For this reason among others I might,89458_1.txt
say in the beginning that I do not believe,89458_1.txt
in capital punishment. I do not,89458_1.txt
believe that it is the true remedy for,89458_1.txt
homicide.,89458_1.txt
We have in America on an average,89458_1.txt
two hundred lynchings every year and,89458_1.txt
about one hundred legal executions.,89458_1.txt
The majority of these lynchings are in,89458_1.txt
the South -- perhaps 60 per cent of,89458_1.txt
them. This is an unmitigated disgrace,89458_1.txt
. It is a disgrace to the South.,89458_1.txt
It is a disgrace to the nation. It is a,89458_1.txt
disgrace to humanity.,89458_1.txt
But the question to which we address,89458_1.txt
ourselves is one that affects the,89458_1.txt
attitude of the races. Is it true that,89458_1.txt
the negro is lynched because he is a,89458_1.txt
negro? I do not believe there is one,89458_1.txt
I word of truth in the statement.,89458_1.txt
Negroes are not lynched because of,89458_1.txt
their color; they are lynched for crime.,89458_1.txt

"to this assertion, that"" the white",89458_1.txt
man in the South who is guilty of the,89458_1.txt
same crime meets an awful doom as,89458_1.txt
swiftly as does the black man. It is,89458_1.txt
notable that in ali the spasms of indignation,89458_1.txt

SOUTHERN GLEANINGS.,89515_2.txt
Reminiscences of Ben Hill of Georgia.,89515_2.txt
A Southern correspondent relates the fol-,89515_2.txt
owing incidents in the career of the late,89515_2.txt
senator Ben II. Hill: In 1855 Mr. Hill declared,89515_2.txt
himself a candidate for congress in the,89515_2.txt
"Fourth Congressional District, and at an in-",89515_2.txt
ormal meeting of representatives the,89515_2.txt
of,89515_2.txt
"Whig party, held in the town of Newman, his",89515_2.txt
Pandidacy was indorsed. In this campaign,89515_2.txt
Mr. Hill was in reality the candidate of the,89515_2.txt
"American or"" Knownothing"" party, which",89515_2.txt
had just taken shape in Georgia. He was opposed,89515_2.txt
"by ex- Chief Justice Hiram Warner, of",89515_2.txt
"Greenville, who ran as the nominee of the",89515_2.txt
Democratic party. The race was warm and,89515_2.txt
closely contested. Warner winning by the,89515_2.txt
"trifling majority of 66 votes in a district which,",89515_2.txt
"prior to that time, was accustomed to roll",89515_2.txt
"up a democratic majority of 2,500 votes. In",89515_2.txt
1856 Hill was placed on the electoral ticket,89515_2.txt
"for that Millard his wonderful Fillmore powers. It was on during the"" hustings this year""",89515_2.txt
"were first shown to the best advantage, he",89515_2.txt
having met and vanquished both Alexander,89515_2.txt
H. Stephens and Robert Toombs in debate,89515_2.txt
in,89515_2.txt
"the town of Lexington, Oglethorpe",89515_2.txt
"County. Toombs didn't care to fight him,",89515_2.txt
but Stephens was so incensed at the,89515_2.txt
new great man who had literally laid him out,89515_2.txt
on his own stamping ground that he forthwith,89515_2.txt
challenged him. In reply Hill wrote that,89515_2.txt
celebrated note which is now a part of the,89515_2.txt
political history of the State. It was in these,89515_2.txt
"words:"" I will not fight you. I have a con",89515_2.txt
"Scie ce and a family. You have neither."" In",89515_2.txt
1858 Hill was retained to defend William A.,89515_2.txt
"Choice, who killed the bailiff, Webb, at Atlan-",89515_2.txt
"ta. The case is reported in 34 Georgia, and is",89515_2.txt
"famous. Bill Choice, as he was called, was a",89515_2.txt
"man of good education and marked talent,",89515_2.txt
"belonging to one of the best families of Rome,",89515_2.txt
Ga. While on a visit to Atlanta he got on a,89515_2.txt
"spree, and while drinking with some fiends",89515_2.txt
"in the bar of the old Atlanta Hotel, which",89515_2.txt
then stood where the Kimball House now,89515_2.txt
"stands, James Webb, the justice court bailiff,",89515_2.txt
handed him a notice showing that he had,89515_2.txt
been sued for$ 10. This so enraged Choice,89515_2.txt
that he attempted to punish Webb on the,89515_2.txt
"spot, but was prevented by bystanders.",89515_2.txt
"Early the following morning, fresh from the",89515_2.txt
"night's debauch, Choice walked into Prior",89515_2.txt
"street, and, seeing Webb standing on the opposite",89515_2.txt

"aim, shot him down without the",89515_2.txt
est,89515_2.txt
slight-,89515_2.txt
warning. The town was in an uproar in,89515_2.txt
"a few minutes, and many of the best citizens",89515_2.txt
were so outraged at the act that they,89515_2.txt
declared for lynch law. Choice defied the,89515_2.txt
"ficers, saying that he would kill the first man of",89515_2.txt
who laid hands upon him. He was finally,89515_2.txt
captured by strategy and safely lodged in the,89515_2.txt
"lock- up just before the howling mob, clamorous",89515_2.txt
"for his blood, reached the station- house.",89515_2.txt
Many able lawyers were engaged to defend,89515_2.txt
"him, young Hill among the number. Public",89515_2.txt
opinion was against the prisoner. The defense,89515_2.txt
"pleaded insanity, and after the longest",89515_2.txt
and most exciting trial in the annals of Ful,89515_2.txt
"ton County, the prisoner was convicted. Hill",89515_2.txt
"had thrown his whole soul into the case, and",89515_2.txt
was bent upon saving his client. In those,89515_2.txt
days the pardoning power was vested in the,89515_2.txt
State Senate. Hill went back to Troup County,89515_2.txt
", made the Choice case an issue in the campaign",89515_2.txt
", and was elected to the state Senate,",89515_2.txt
where he made his celebrated speech for the,89515_2.txt

"State Senator William Harris, of Worth County",89515_2.txt
", once said:"" It was the grandest effort that",89515_2.txt

"His tongue seemed' to drop manua,' for surely",89515_2.txt
such exquisite strains of pathos never fell up,89515_2.txt
on the air. The Senate was in tears. The President,89515_2.txt
wept aloud. The women screamed. I,89515_2.txt

marvelous speech. They ring in my ears even,89515_2.txt
"now, and that scene was enacted twenty- five",89515_2.txt
"years ago. He said, speaking of Choice's insanity",89515_2.txt
: Soft as the zephyr from the orange,89515_2.txt

"that all time may syllable the shame, this is",89515_2.txt
"Georgia's Lunatic Asylum."" Choice was declared",89515_2.txt
insane by an overwhelming vote and,89515_2.txt
sent to the asylum. Hill was the ablest and,89515_2.txt
bitterest opponent in Georgia of the reconstruction,89515_2.txt
"measures, and at the peril of expatriation",89515_2.txt
", delivered a speech of the boldest",89515_2.txt
and most fiery invective in Davies' Hall at,89515_2.txt
"Atlanta in 1866, in which he denounced the",89515_2.txt

been asked to address the people on the,89515_2.txt
"situation, bat Hill alone had the audacity to",89515_2.txt
speak his sentiments in public. He continued,89515_2.txt
his opposition to reconstruction by writing,89515_2.txt
"his"" Notes on the Situation"" -which are",89515_2.txt
regarded in the South as the finest philippies,89515_2.txt
since those of Demosthenes- and at a vast,89515_2.txt

"lanta in 1868, he gave utterance to his celebrated",89515_2.txt

"Toombs spoke at the same time and place,",89515_2.txt
wives to,89515_2.txt
and at the conclusion of Hill's speech Toombs,89515_2.txt
arose in the presence of the vast crowd and,89515_2.txt
"congratulated him, saying:"" Sir, it was the",89515_2.txt
"grandest effort I ever heard."" Bullock fled the",89515_2.txt
"State in 1871, and upon the coming into power",89515_2.txt

"Ninth Congressional District, Hill, who lived",89515_2.txt
"part of the time at Athens, in that district,",89515_2.txt
became a candidate for the nomination. The,89515_2.txt
"convention broke up in a row, and Hill made",89515_2.txt
"the race before the people, beating his opponent",89515_2.txt
", Estes. His term having expired, he was",89515_2.txt
renominated and returned to Congress with,89515_2.txt
"out opposition. In 1876, while still in Congress,",89515_2.txt
he antagonized Norwood for the United States,89515_2.txt

"various parts of the State, urging the Legislature",89515_2.txt
"to elect Hul, and he made a three- hour",89515_2.txt

"wood held his own pretty well, but the",89515_2.txt
"pressure was too great, and on the third day,",89515_2.txt
"a Norwood man changed his vote to Hill, the",89515_2.txt
"Norwood men stampeded, and enough votes",89515_2.txt
were changed to give Hill the prize. The Republicans,89515_2.txt
and negroes in the Legislature voted,89515_2.txt
for Hill. It has often been said that in,89515_2.txt

"of Ada Atkinson, had entirely dispersed",89521_0.txt

peeped over the straggling little town from,89521_0.txt
"across the prairie this morning, it was as",89521_0.txt
quiet as if its serenity had not been appalled,89521_0.txt
only a few hours before by the blood- cloud,89521_0.txt
and threatening thunder of,89521_0.txt
mob violence,89521_0.txt
". The awfui cloud, however,",89521_0.txt
"it is now evident, was only a vapor,",89521_0.txt
and from its constitutional elements of,89521_0.txt
weakness it was dispelled without any serious,89521_0.txt
damage to any object with which it,89521_0.txt
came in contact. The wind- mill is almost,89521_0.txt
the sole motive power by which machinery,89521_0.txt
"in Benton county is operated, and the",89521_0.txt
strength of the mob which made such a boisterous,89521_0.txt
attempt last night to lynch Nelling,89521_0.txt
was constituted of the same forces. It is bad,89521_0.txt
engineering to try to run machinery and,89521_0.txt
mobs on the same principles of motive,89521_0.txt
power.,89521_0.txt
The crowd which gathered at Fowler yesterday,89521_0.txt
afternoon and last night was attracted,89521_0.txt
by a curiosity to see the lynching which had,89521_0.txt
"been so loudly threatened, and, among the",89521_0.txt
600 or 700 men who had congregated in the,89521_0.txt
"place, it is doubtful if there were a dozen",89521_0.txt
persons who had come to town with the determination,89521_0.txt
to join in doing violence. Each,89521_0.txt
was expecting the other to do what both were,89521_0.txt
Most of those who,89521_0.txt
wanting to witness.,89521_0.txt
"were in town had come to stay all night, and",89521_0.txt
every place where lodging could be obtained,89521_0.txt
was crowded to its fullest capacity. Those,89521_0.txt
"who arrived late were unable to get lodging,",89521_0.txt
and therefore had to walk the streets the,89521_0.txt
"night. It was regarded as a holiday occasion,",89521_0.txt
and the saloons were freely patronized. Before,89521_0.txt
"dark the crowd was boisterously drunk,",89521_0.txt
and the town was in an uproar. Threats that,89521_0.txt
the murderer would be lynched could be,89521_0.txt
"heard in chorus all along the streets, but",89521_0.txt
some body of men besides those already,89521_0.txt
in town were expected to do the work. The,89521_0.txt
mob was expected to arrive from Templeton,89521_0.txt
"at 9 o'clock, but it did not come. The",89521_0.txt
drunken crowd reeled up the street toward,89521_0.txt
"the jail, howling fiercely, but no concerted",89521_0.txt
"movement was made, and without a leader",89521_0.txt
and without organization they gathered about,89521_0.txt
"the jail, expecting the prisoner to be",89521_0.txt
delivered to them upon demand. The fierce,89521_0.txt
howling which was kept up incessantly had,89521_0.txt
the effect to discomfit Nelling as much as,89521_0.txt

"succession, four of which took effect.",89567_0.txt
"One ball is lodged in the left lung, which",89567_0.txt
it is impossible to probe. Another made a,89567_0.txt
"slight flesh wound on the breast, while",89567_0.txt
"the others took effect in the thighs,",89567_0.txt
crushing the bone of the,89567_0.txt
right,89567_0.txt
leg in a frightful manner. The,89567_0.txt
daughter of the wounded lady rushed,89567_0.txt
"out frantic with grief crying for help,",89567_0.txt
which soon brought a large crowd of excited,89567_0.txt
spectators to the scene. The lady,89567_0.txt
had only been able to get a few steps,89567_0.txt
from the door of the restaurant after receiving,89567_0.txt
the first wound before she fell,89567_0.txt
upon the walk exhausted. The fiend had,89567_0.txt
"followed her closely all the time, taking",89567_0.txt
"every opportunity to fire, and it was after",89567_0.txt
she lay exhausted on the pavement that,89567_0.txt
he stood over her and fired the two shots,89567_0.txt
that mangled her limbs so horribly. After,89567_0.txt
emptying every cell of his deadly weapon,89567_0.txt
"he started to run, turning into the",89567_0.txt
alley just below Main away street. Officers Bal-,89567_0.txt
lyntine and Brown happened to be in the,89567_0.txt
"vacant lot at the back of the block, and",89567_0.txt
hearing the reports had started for the,89567_0.txt
place from which they emanated. The,89567_0.txt
then frightened man rushed right into,89567_0.txt

allayed the feeling of the mob that was,89567_0.txt
fast gathering. He was placed in jail and,89567_0.txt
the woman was cared for by friends.,89567_0.txt
This morning just before daylight,89567_0.txt
a mob of twenty or twenty- five men,89567_0.txt
called at the jail and aroused,89567_0.txt
the keeper. He demanded to know what,89567_0.txt
"they wanted, which was soon made known",89567_0.txt
to him by a demand for the keys to the,89567_0.txt
cell in which the prisoner was confined.,89567_0.txt
"They were peremptorily refused the keys,",89567_0.txt
whereupon two or three of the mob broke,89567_0.txt
the lock to the door and secured the murderer,89567_0.txt
while others stood guard. At this,89567_0.txt
juncture the officers appeared at the outside,89567_0.txt
"of the jail- yard, but were covered by",89567_0.txt
weapons in the hands of those standing,89567_0.txt
"guard, and told not to come any farther.",89567_0.txt
A gag was placed over the culprit's,89567_0.txt
mouth and he was taken to the tower upon,89567_0.txt
which the fire bell hangs. The rope,89567_0.txt
was placed around his neck. He was,89567_0.txt
drawn up four or five times and finally,89567_0.txt
left to hang until six o'clock in the,89567_0.txt

LOUISIANA BARBARISM.,89628_2.txt
A Washington dispatch says the State Department,89628_2.txt
has received from the Italian authorities,89628_2.txt
a copy of the complete report made,89628_2.txt
"by the Marquis Romono, secretary of the",89628_2.txt
"embassy at Washington, on his personal investigation",89628_2.txt
of the recent lynching of five,89628_2.txt
"Italians at Tallulah, La. The secretary was",89628_2.txt
sent to Louisiana to investigate the matter.,89628_2.txt
and his report embodies the Italian side of,89628_2.txt
the case. It was easy to see from the beginning,89628_2.txt
that the affair would become an,89628_2.txt
international one. The chances are that,89628_2.txt
"some, if not all, of the victims of the mob",89628_2.txt
"were Italian subjects, and we have learned",89628_2.txt
by experience that the Italian government,89628_2.txt
does not overlook such cases. In its main,89628_2.txt
features the present one closely resembles,89628_2.txt
"that of 1891, when several Italians were",89628_2.txt
"lynched by a mob at New Orleans, and",89628_2.txt
which ended by the United States paying,89628_2.txt
"$ 25,000 indemnity to the families of the victims",89628_2.txt
". The Italian government, in a spirit",89628_2.txt
"of friendliness, accepted the indemnity as",89628_2.txt
"sufficient reparation,"" without prejudice to",89628_2.txt
actions at law which may be brought by the,89628_2.txt
"aggrieved parties.""",89628_2.txt
The present case grew out of race hatred,89628_2.txt
almost as distinctly as if the murdered. Ital-,89628_2.txt
ians had been negroes. It was their dark,89628_2.txt
complexion and the association with negroes,89628_2.txt
that led to their being lynched for complicity,89628_2.txt
in an affray in which a white man,89628_2.txt
was hurt. To understand the case one must,89628_2.txt
know something of the community where it,89628_2.txt
"occurred. Mr. Norman Walker, chief edit-",89628_2.txt
writer of the Times- Democrat newspaper,89628_2.txt
"orial, of New Orleans, says in an article in",89628_2.txt
killing of a goat owned by one of the Ital-,89628_3.txt
lans by Dr. Hodges. The first attack came,89628_3.txt
"from one of the Italians, but it was not a",89628_3.txt
"murderous attack, as the man had no weapon",89628_3.txt
. Dr. Hodges had a pistol and used it in,89628_3.txt
"self- defense, as he had a right to do, first",89628_3.txt
beating his assailant on the head with the,89628_3.txt
butt of it and then returning a shot that,89628_3.txt
was fired at him. The shooting drew a,89628_3.txt
crowd and the mob did the rest. The first,89628_3.txt
"cry"" Lynch them."" Two of the Ital-",89628_3.txt
"lans was were lynched immediately, and three",89628_3.txt
But with so small a white population in,89628_3.txt
the midst of such an overwhelming majority,89628_3.txt
"of negroes"" a strong hand"" has been deemed",89628_3.txt
necessary to keep the latter in subjection;,89628_3.txt
"and, accordingly, in causes arising between",89628_3.txt
whites and negroes the most summary,89628_3.txt
method is resorted to rather than the ordinary,89628_3.txt
slow processes of the law. When a,89628_3.txt
planter was killed by a negro in 1894 nine,89628_3.txt
"negroes were lynched for it, and but a short",89628_3.txt
time ago a negro was lynched for shooting,89628_3.txt
at a white man. The Tallulah affair has,89628_3.txt
brought out the fact that there have been,89628_3.txt
several recent lynchings in Madison which,89628_3.txt
the papers did not report- one only two,89628_3.txt
months ago at Omega. When the Italians,89628_3.txt
"first came into Madison, a few years ago,",89628_3.txt
they were a puzzle to the white people of,89628_3.txt
"the parish. Like the bat, they were difficult",89628_3.txt
"to classify, and this was more difficult because",89628_3.txt
"they dealt mainly with the negroes,",89628_3.txt
and associated with them nearly on terms of,89628_3.txt
"equality. They could, therefore, hardly be",89628_3.txt
"classed as"" white men,"" and yet they certainly",89628_3.txt
were not negroes. Just how to treat,89628_3.txt
them was a difficult preblem. It has finally,89628_3.txt
been setttled. They are to get the justice,89628_3.txt
awarded to a negro in Madison who assaults,89628_3.txt
or shoots at or kills a white man- lynching;,89628_3.txt
not a trial.,89628_3.txt
This is the key to the whole affair. The,89628_3.txt
"lynching occurred on the 20th of July last,",89628_3.txt
and the first account of it represented that,89628_3.txt
the Italians had conspired to murder one,89628_3.txt
Dr. Hodges and had actually inflicted fatal,89628_3.txt
"wounds upon him."" The five victims,"" said",89628_3.txt
"the first dispatch,"" were strung up to trees",89628_3.txt
for supposed connection with a plot to murder,89628_3.txt
"Dr. Hodges, a prominent physician of",89628_3.txt
"the place,"" who, it was added,"" is badly",89628_3.txt
wounded and the doctors say he cannot,89628_3.txt
"recover."" He was not badly wounded and",89628_3.txt
is still alive. The affray between him,89628_3.txt
the Italians grew out of a quarrel over and the,89628_3.txt
It is quite likely that the information on,89628_4.txt
which the sheriff of Miami county appealed,89628_4.txt
to the Governor for military ald to prevent,89628_4.txt
"a lynching was unreliable, but his appeal",89628_4.txt
was sufficient justification for the action of,89628_4.txt
the Governor. In such cases it is best to err,89628_4.txt

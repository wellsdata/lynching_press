A large crowd gathered about the city,91556_3.txt
prison to- night at 8:30 o'clock and forced,91556_3.txt
in the doors. The prison was soon,91556_3.txt

"no resistance, as Peck earlier in the",91556_3.txt
evening had been quietly taken away to,91556_3.txt
Cleveland.,91556_3.txt
To satisfy the mob the officers suggested,91556_3.txt
that a committee of six be appointed to,91556_3.txt

After going through the private apartments,91556_3.txt
of the jail the crowd started to batter,91556_3.txt
down the big iron doors. Deputy Sheriff,91556_3.txt
Stone stood in front of the prison doors,91556_3.txt
and made a speech.,91556_3.txt
He informed the crowd that Peck could,91556_3.txt

the doors of the county courthouse.,91556_3.txt
old courthouse was soon packed and all,91556_3.txt
"rooms searched, except the rooms in the",91556_3.txt
treasury department. A start was made,91556_3.txt
to tear off the iron doors of the treasury,91556_3.txt

"tackle the job, and then the thousands of",91556_3.txt
men and boys again rushed back to the,91556_3.txt
"city prison, crying for the blood of Peck.",91556_3.txt
The city prison was again surrounded,91556_3.txt
and hundreds of people forced their way,91556_3.txt
"into the prison for the second time, insisting",91556_3.txt
that Peck was there. Mayor,91556_3.txt

and driven out of the city in a closed carriage,91556_3.txt
. The people in the mob would not,91556_3.txt
believe the Mayor and continued to yell,91556_3.txt
and demand that Peck be surrendered.,91556_3.txt
Prison Again Attacked.,91556_3.txt
At 10 o'clock the mob began for the,91556_3.txt
third time to attack the city prison. Some,91556_3.txt
one in the crowd began shooting at the,91556_3.txt
building. This was followed by several,91556_3.txt
more shots. The officers in the building,91556_3.txt
appeared at the windows and then shot,91556_3.txt
over the heads of the mob. A man with a,91556_3.txt
shotgun then fired at the officers.,91556_3.txt
It is said that several officers were,91556_3.txt
wounded. The crowd then began to smash,91556_3.txt
in the windows of the city building and,91556_3.txt
the firing became general. Hundreds of,91556_3.txt
shots were exchanged and one boy was,91556_3.txt

Mayor Young is yet in the building and,91556_3.txt
is directing a call for the militia. All,91556_3.txt
the ambulances of the city have been,91556_3.txt
"called out, and the excitement has become",91556_3.txt
intense. The front of the city building,91556_3.txt
is a total wreck and the fire bells are,91556_3.txt
ringing.,91556_3.txt
"At 10:45 p. m., Prison- keeper John E.",91556_3.txt

in the head and also in one of the legs.,91556_3.txt
It is certain that many more people were,91556_3.txt
wounded.,91556_3.txt

"charge, fired upon a mob of lynchers and dispersed them.",91565_0.txt
The attack was of a nature that put a supreme test upon the Sheriff's courage and,91565_0.txt
fidelity to duty. The negro prisoner had been convicted of the murder of a white boy and sentenced,91565_0.txt
to be hanged. Upon the day appointed for the execution a reprieve was obtained by an,91565_0.txt
"appeal to the Supreme Court, and the mob that had gathered to witness the execution was rendered",91565_0.txt
furious by being balked of its victim. It was easy in such a crowd to raise the cry for lynch,91565_0.txt
law and start an attack upon the jail; but it was not easy for the Sheriff to face the danger. Popular,91565_0.txt
"sentiment in Georgia is not averse to lynching negroes who are but suspected of crime, and",91565_0.txt
therefore it was inevitable that the mob in this case should have looked for no more than a formal,91565_0.txt
"opposition to the attempt to lynch one who had been tried and convicted. The mob, however, was",91565_0.txt
mistaken. The Sheriff of Carrollton is an officer who knows his duty and has the courage to fulfill,91565_0.txt

"When officials fail in the performance of duty in the face of mob violence, the country is",91565_0.txt

A,91566_0.txt
awful was the vengeance visited upon a quintet of culprits by a,91566_0.txt
Modoc County mob last night. Hanging to the stringers of a bridge,91566_0.txt
"on the outskirts of Lookout, a little town ten miles west of Adin,",91566_0.txt
"the bodies of Calvin Hall, two of his three sons and another young",91566_0.txt

From a culvert between the town and the bridge the body of the,91566_0.txt

"the lynchers' victims, because he fought for his life.",91566_0.txt
The mob was in no mood to be delayed. Halting long enough to choke out,91566_0.txt
the life of Frank Hall. it proceeded on its way to the place selected for the execution,91566_0.txt
. There the father and his remaining two sons and their comrade were put,91566_0.txt
to death. No time was wasted. The victims of the mob's vengeance were not,91566_0.txt
even given the opportunity of making a farewell statement. One by one they,91566_0.txt
"were stretched up, willing hands pulling at the ropes that hauled them into",91566_0.txt

"woman. B. D. Yantis, who shared the Hall home, was 27 years old.",91566_0.txt
For some time past the Halls and Yantis have been suspected of the thefts,91566_0.txt
"of numerous articles, such as barbed wire, pieces of harness and articles of raiment",91566_0.txt
taken from the clotheslines of Lookout. They were arrested on Saturday,91566_0.txt
and constables armed with a search warrant repaired to their home. Briet,91566_0.txt
"search served to bring to light eviienceof their guilt, and they were taken from",91566_0.txt
the Hall ranch to Lookout and there detained in custody to await examination,91566_0.txt
"and trial. In the meantime the search was continued, and halters, dishes and",91566_0.txt
more articles of clothing were xound hidden away. The simple and honest populace,91566_0.txt
was aroused to the highest pitch of excitement as one by one the stolen articles,91566_0.txt
were restored to their owners. From the day of the arrest of the culprits,91566_0.txt
"there have been muttered threats, and the Halls and Yantis knew that only a",91566_0.txt

"At 2 o'clock this morning a mob of masked men, their number variously estimated",91566_0.txt
"at from thirty to fifty, suddenly appeared in the street before the",91566_0.txt
hotel. No hint of their coming had been given and the two men on guard were,91566_0.txt
taken completely by surprise. No attempt to spirit the prisoners away to a,91566_0.txt

"They looked into the muzzles of rifles and shotguns held by steady hands, and",91566_0.txt
gruff voices from behind the masks ordered them bluntly to keep still if they,91566_0.txt
were not ready to die. The two guards were powerless to make resistance,91566_0.txt
and they attempted none.,91566_0.txt
"While some were disarming Brown and Goyette, others of the mob broke in",91566_0.txt
upon the accused men and dragged them from their quarters. The masked men,91566_0.txt
"knew their ground thoroughly, and lost no time in rounding up the frightened",91566_0.txt

scene of the mob's terrible vengeance.,91566_0.txt
"The hands of each of the accused men were bound securely behind him, and",91566_0.txt
a rope was noosed about the neck of each. The mob worked swiftly and silently,91566_0.txt

The mob moved swiftly and silently through the streets and along the road,91566_0.txt
leading to the bridge that spans Pitt River. There was no hesitancy or discussion,91566_0.txt

in the morning and mustered out of the,91566_1.txt
service. With hundreds of dollars in their,91566_1.txt
"pockets, the discharged men started out",91566_1.txt
to celebrate their release from military,91566_1.txt

they were to have been tried in the county where their,91570_0.txt
"offenses are alleged to have been committed, and the",91570_0.txt
law provides ample punishment for any crime of which,91570_0.txt
they might have been convicted. Under such circumstances,91570_0.txt

her cell and told her of the Grand Jury's,91592_0.txt
decision. The girl seems to have undergone,91592_0.txt
a revolution of feeling since her incarceration,91592_0.txt
and she has a perfect horror of,91592_0.txt
the men who were her intimates. Some of,91592_0.txt

she threw herself into the arms of Mrs.,91592_0.txt
"Yancey, wife of the Sheriff, whose family",91592_0.txt
occupy the front part of the jail as a,91592_0.txt
dwelling. Mrs. Yancey comforted the,91592_0.txt
weeping girl and brought her into the,91592_0.txt
"house, where she will remain away from",91592_0.txt
the hounds that have been pursuing her.,91592_0.txt
Early this morning the Grand Jury convened,91592_0.txt
", and Ada McReynolds was one of",91592_0.txt
the first witnesses. She told her story,91592_0.txt
substantially as it appeared in THE CALL.,91592_0.txt
She told how Jasper Brown had become,91592_0.txt
her intimate friend and had coaxed her,91592_0.txt
to sign a paper stating that her brothers,91592_0.txt
had killed Morris. She related how,91592_0.txt
Brown knew that the statement was,91592_0.txt
"false, but that he told her to sign it anyway",91592_0.txt
", because if she would it would prove",91592_0.txt
that Morris did not commit suicide. This,91592_0.txt
"proof, to her, was equivalent to$ 5000, as",91592_0.txt
Brown said that the policy was made out,91592_0.txt
"in her name. She signed as directed, but",91592_0.txt
"only after M. J. Reilly, the other detective",91592_0.txt
", swore that he would have no arrests",91592_0.txt
made and that no trouble would come,91592_0.txt
of the whole thing. out,91592_0.txt
The girl's testimony presented both,91592_0.txt
Brown and Reilly in a bad light and they,91592_0.txt
were brought before the jury to explain,91592_0.txt
their position. They stated that the insurance,91592_0.txt
dodge was but a bait to induce the,91592_0.txt
girl to tell what she knew about the murder,91592_0.txt
", and they professed that their efforts",91592_0.txt
were made only in the interests of justice.,91592_0.txt
Brown produced an old Fireman's Fund,91592_0.txt
"insurance envelope with the word"" Fireman's",91592_0.txt

"Reilly to Brown saying,"" Our general",91592_0.txt
"agent is in town; bring Ada to see him,""",91592_0.txt

money would be hers and no arrests,91592_0.txt
"would be made, since both",91592_0.txt
and Brown said so. Reilly,91592_0.txt
The nature of the evidence was such that,91592_0.txt
the jurors promptly ordered the girl to be,91592_0.txt

people about Chinese Camp that Westley,91592_0.txt
McReynolds was the murderer and was,91592_0.txt
about to be arrested. This talk precipi-,91592_0.txt
tated the action of the authorities. West-,91592_0.txt
ley McReynolds and his brother Albert,91592_0.txt
were arrested and housed in the County,91592_0.txt
Jail ahead of the time the mob assembled,91592_0.txt
to lynch them. Now Westley McReynolds,91592_0.txt
lies back in his dark cell and actually,91592_0.txt
laughs. He seems to be easy of feeling,91592_0.txt
and does not show any dread of the remade,91592_0.txt
sults of the terrible accusation,91592_0.txt
against him. Westley depends chiefly for,91592_0.txt
an acquittal on the testimony of the Ward,91592_0.txt
family. He claims that he was heard to,91592_0.txt
cough by them some time about the hour,91592_0.txt
when the murder was committed. If this,91592_0.txt
is the only alibi the accused can present,91592_0.txt
there is every likelihood that the detec-,91592_0.txt
will hang him.,91592_0.txt
"tives The"" cough"" alibi was started some days",91592_0.txt
ago. Detective Reilly suggested it himself,91592_0.txt
"to one of Westley McReynolds' friends,",91592_0.txt
"saying:"" I hear that the Wards for whom",91592_0.txt
Westley worked heard him coughing in,91592_0.txt
"bed the night of the murder, but I don't",91592_0.txt
"believe it."" That was the bait Westley",91592_0.txt
"McReynolds heard, and he swallowed it",91592_0.txt
Since that time he is depending on that,91592_0.txt
alibi. The Wards deny they saw Westley,91592_0.txt
that night. There is a wonderful revulsion,91592_0.txt
of feeling in regard to the accused,91592_0.txt
men since the methods of the private detectives,91592_0.txt
to obtain their conviction have,91592_0.txt
been bruited. It is now believed that even,91592_0.txt
if indictments are found a conviction cannot,91592_0.txt
follow on account of the lack of evidence,91592_0.txt
. The situation is so very different,91592_0.txt

There is a quarrel that has started among,91592_0.txt
some of the friends of the murdered man.,91592_0.txt
It seems that at the time of the arrest the,91592_0.txt
telephone wires of Calaveras and Tuolumne,91592_0.txt
counties were kept hot by somebody calling,91592_0.txt
"up Goorge Morris' friends, telling them",91592_0.txt
of the cold- blooded murder and urging the,91592_0.txt
speedy lynching of the suspected. This,91592_0.txt
"was an appeal of great significance, the deceased",91592_0.txt
standing not only as a very popular,91592_0.txt
"man among the masses, but as a prominent",91592_0.txt
member of the Knights of Pythias and of,91592_0.txt
"the Foresters, representing a force of 213",91592_0.txt
friends and brothers in the county. The,91592_0.txt
telephone agencies in the various townships,91592_0.txt
and stations on realizing that trouble,91592_0.txt
was brewing cut off the wires. Now this,91592_0.txt

is known to everybody and no one,91592_0.txt

putting a rope around his neck they took and,91607_0.txt
him a short distance into the woods and,91607_0.txt

Yarborough was lynched was the murder,91607_0.txt

Three have previously been legally,91607_0.txt

Just what will happen as the next curiosity of lynching,91608_0.txt

"and curious things were afloat, and if the credulous",91608_0.txt
"and superstitious did not see what they wanted, they",91608_0.txt
had only to ask for it. Then the Civil War came on,91608_0.txt
and in the potency of its passion and its intense and,91608_0.txt
mighty call to the people all things else were burned,91608_0.txt
as by fire and no sound was heard but that of the,91608_0.txt
great trumpet that called the sons of the republic,91608_0.txt
to exertion and fidelity unto death.,91608_0.txt
Since then another generation has arisen and another,91608_0.txt
is coming with manhood just thickening its,91608_0.txt
neck. The old disposition to take up a fad is still,91608_0.txt
upon man. But unfortunately the fad now seems to,91608_0.txt
"be lynching. Men and women are lynched, and what",91608_0.txt
"is supposed to be justice is administered, al frseco,",91608_0.txt
while the dust gathers on the Judge's desk and in,91608_0.txt
"the jury box of the criminal courts, for their place",91608_0.txt
is usurped and their function assumed by the mob.,91608_0.txt
The savagery of the fad is progressive. At first the,91608_0.txt
victims were hanged. Then soon it was the rule to,91608_0.txt
riddle their dead and pendent bodies with bullets.,91608_0.txt
Then they were shot full of lead as they were strung,91608_0.txt
"up. Next a mob of artists in lynching, having shot",91608_0.txt
"and hanged a man, cut his body down and burned",91608_0.txt
"it. The next step was a short one, and was taken,",91608_0.txt
"we believe, in Texas, where the victim was caught,",91608_0.txt
"condemned, pinioned and burned alive, tied to a stake.",91608_0.txt
Observers believed that this marked the high tide,91608_0.txt
of the fad and that the horror of it would have a,91608_0.txt
repellent effect and that the horror of it would have a,91608_0.txt
decline and disappear. But they were mistaken. The,91608_0.txt
horror of the stake became a fascination. It seemed,91608_0.txt
to fittingly express the spirit of revenge roused by the,91608_0.txt
"vile nature of the crime which it expiated, and in several",91608_0.txt
instances it has been used to punish offenses of,91608_0.txt
less enormity.,91608_0.txt
This horrible fad is not confined to any section.,91608_0.txt
In all divisions of the States it is rampant. The South,91608_0.txt
"has furnished the greatest number of cases, but they",91608_0.txt
do not differ in kind from those that have occurred,91608_0.txt
"in Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming, Indiana, Illinois and",91608_0.txt
other States. In the dispatches of one day recently a,91608_0.txt
"rope was being knotted for a negro woman, in South",91608_0.txt
"Carolina, who beheaded her children and burned their",91608_0.txt
"bodies, negroes being the intended avengers. A Mis-",91608_0.txt
souri Sheriff was standing off a mob that desired to,91608_0.txt
lynch a loafer for shooting an officer. A Delaware,91608_0.txt
mob was in hot pursuit of a negro to burn him for,91608_0.txt
shooting a constable. Minnesota lynchers were in,91608_0.txt
"pursuit of a wretch guilty of an unspeakable crime,",91608_0.txt
and the same cause moved another party in Ohio.,91608_0.txt
But the oddest of all that day's doings appeared in,91608_0.txt
Georgia. A penitentiary Warden was the threatened,91608_0.txt
"victim. Among his prisoners is a white woman, a",91608_0.txt
"Miss Crist, known as"" the Diamond Queen,"" born",91608_0.txt
"of a good family, and believed to be insane. The",91608_0.txt
"Warden's name is Alagood, and he ordered Miss",91608_0.txt
"Crist, though a delicate woman, to work as a fieldhand",91608_0.txt
"with the negro prisoners, incited thereto by his wife.",91608_0.txt
"Now Mrs. Alagood's methods seem to belie her name,",91608_0.txt
since they were a la bad. When Miss Crist protested,91608_0.txt
against assignment to field work Mrs. Alagood ordered,91608_0.txt
her husband to have her whipped. Thereupon,91608_0.txt
"the frail white woman was taken to the torture- room,",91608_0.txt
tied up and given forty lashes on the bare back by,91608_0.txt
the Warden. The thongs cut to the ribs and left,91608_0.txt
gashes in her breast. No male prisoner had ever received,91608_0.txt
"more than ten lashes, but the Warden's wife",91608_0.txt
is thorough in what she undertakes. At once Georgia,91608_0.txt
was on fire and immediately it was proposed to lynch,91608_0.txt
the Warden. He made Adam's excuse that his wife,91608_0.txt
"ordered it, and the Governor proceeded to investigate",91608_0.txt
. But the Alagoods don't show themselves in,91608_0.txt
public and the masks and rope are ready if the,91608_0.txt
Warden is caught. the,91608_0.txt
Thompson appeared with his new school of medicine,91608_0.txt
"and squirted a stream of"" No. Six"" and lobelia",91608_0.txt
into his followers. Preissnitz promulgated his Graf-,91608_0.txt
"fenberg water cure, and his followers were legion, believing",91608_0.txt

the end of the world came. Graham got dyspepsia,91608_0.txt

the outrage spread and searching parties,91612_0.txt
were sent in every direction. He,91612_0.txt
"was captured in hiding at Falcon, four",91612_0.txt
miles below the scene of the crime by,91612_0.txt
four of the posse. He was brought to,91612_0.txt
Hawesville and surrendered to the,91612_0.txt
"jailer, while the town was deserted",91612_0.txt
searching for him. In the meantime the,91612_0.txt

secretly guarded in the graveyard on the,91612_0.txt
"hill until morning, when he was again",91612_0.txt

"wagons, and in trains. They were impatient",91612_0.txt
for darkness to cover the,91612_0.txt
ground. It was rumored that militia,91612_0.txt
would arrive at 4:40 from Owensboro,91612_0.txt
for his protection. The angry crowd,91612_0.txt
would not stand this and they placed,91612_0.txt
trusty sentinels on the hill overlooking,91612_0.txt
town to give a sign if the train bore,91612_0.txt
"such protection. They failed to come,",91612_0.txt

were forced to yield. The excitement,91612_0.txt
at this time was intense. Promptly,91612_0.txt
at 5 o'clock the march to the Courthouse,91612_0.txt
square was begun. Halting in,91612_0.txt

everything was,91612_0.txt

In the meantime Bushrod was given,91612_0.txt
an opportunity for confession and,91612_0.txt
prayer.,91612_0.txt
His confession was complete.,91612_0.txt
He said he was guilty and that this was,91612_0.txt

A dispatch was published in our columns,91626_1.txt

an alleged negro conspiracy in Choctaw,91626_1.txt
"county, Alabama. It was said that certain",91626_1.txt
negroes had formed a plan to murder,91626_1.txt
all the white men in the county; that a,91626_1.txt
bundle of papers had been found describing,91626_1.txt
the whole plot; and that on the,91626_1.txt
strength of the information thus obtained,91626_1.txt
"a thousand white citizens had assembled,",91626_1.txt
"seized six of the negro ringleaders, and",91626_1.txt

"once pronounced it a fiction, and expressed",91626_1.txt

negro county. was,91626_1.txt
"a preacher, a man of great native force of",91626_1.txt
"character, a Republican, and a natural",91626_1.txt
leader of his people. For some time past,91626_1.txt
it had been the practice of certain Bourbon,91626_1.txt
planters to compel the colored men who,91626_1.txt
worked for them to vote the Democratic,91626_1.txt
ticket. Oa an election day one of these,91626_1.txt

"over, had not Turner had the audacity",91626_1.txt
to act on the theory that colored citizens,91626_1.txt
possess equal political rights in Alabama.,91626_1.txt
He organized the colored vote in Choctaw,91626_1.txt
"county for the Republican ticket, and he",91626_1.txt
proved himself so good a politician that at,91626_1.txt
the election of August 7th the Bourbons,91626_1.txt
had a majority of only 26. It was evident,91626_1.txt
that if this active colored leader was not,91626_1.txt
stopped in his political career he would,91626_1.txt
carry the county next time. He was,91626_1.txt
Chairman of the Republican County Committee,91626_1.txt
", and his word was law with his followers",91626_1.txt
". So, ten days after the election, a",91626_1.txt
mob of white scoundrels collected under,91626_1.txt
"cover of night, took Turner and his principal",91626_1.txt
"followers, hanged the former, and",91626_1.txt

under every accompaniment of insult and,91626_1.txt

The contemptibly silly story which the,91626_1.txt
Choctaw county Bourbons invented as an,91626_1.txt

more preposterous than the other. The,91626_1.txt
"plain truth, now first disclosed, is as we",91626_1.txt
have stated it. Jack Turners raurdered,91626_1.txt

"Republican majority of over five hundred,",91700_1.txt

MOB LAW AT THE SOUTH.,91703_0.txt
The lynching of negroes by Southern,91703_0.txt
mobs has become so ordinary an occurrence,91703_0.txt
"as scarcely to excite remark, but the",91703_0.txt
phenomenon ne vertheless calls for the most,91703_0.txt
"energetic protest, and indicates an abnormal",91703_0.txt
state of society. In the States where,91703_0.txt
"it is most common, there is no pretense",91703_0.txt
that the machinery of justice is crippled,91703_0.txt
or corrupt. It has never been claimed,91703_0.txt
that summary and lawless modes of pun-,91703_0.txt
ent were had recourse to because the,91703_0.txt
conviction of criminals was uncertain. So,91703_0.txt
far as can be perceived negro criminals at,91703_0.txt
the South receive the full measure of their,91703_0.txt
offenses when they are brought before the,91703_0.txt
Courts. The only explanation of the passion,91703_0.txt
for lynching which has become so common,91703_0.txt
"is, that the Courts do not punish all",91703_0.txt
"offenses with death, while the lynchers",91703_0.txt
In other words these lynchings,91703_0.txt
do.,91703_0.txt
are at bottom neither more nor less,91703_0.txt
than systematic methods of terrcr-,91703_0.txt
izing the colored people by making,91703_0.txt
them believe that all their offenses,91703_0.txt
are to be regarded as capital. There have,91703_0.txt
been hundreds of foul murders committed,91703_0.txt
"by white men in the South, but unless the",91703_0.txt
murderer happened to be a Republican no,91703_0.txt
thought of lynching has ever arisen because,91703_0.txt
them. When Colonel Tom Buford,91703_0.txt
of,91703_0.txt
assassinated Judge Elliott because the latter,91703_0.txt
"had decided a civil suit against him,",91703_0.txt
the scoundrel was sympathized with and,91703_0.txt
pitied. Had he been a negro it cannot be,91703_0.txt
doubted that all the country would have,91703_0.txt
turned out to hang him summarily. In,91703_0.txt
Mississippi two other villainous white men,91703_0.txt
have just been acquitted on the charge of,91703_0.txt
murdering a man during the Chisholm,91703_0.txt
"massacre. Nobody doubts their guilt,",91703_0.txt
but no white Mississippi jury can be got to,91703_0.txt
other,91703_0.txt
convict them white,91703_0.txt
or any,91703_0.txt
therefore perfectly,91703_0.txt
assassins,91703_0.txt
It is,91703_0.txt
.,91703_0.txt
clear that Southern lynchings have no,91703_0.txt
connection with regard for order and abhorrence,91703_0.txt
of crime. They are rather evidences,91703_0.txt
of the chronic defiance of law and,91703_0.txt
order which the Southern whites,91703_0.txt
themselves upon wherever their colored pride,91703_0.txt
fellow- citizens are concerned. They,91703_0.txt
lynching parties as they organize red-,91703_0.txt

well- understood general policy to keep,91703_0.txt
"down the negroes, and lynching is specially",91703_0.txt
favored because it affords a pretext for,91703_0.txt

An Explanation Explanation,bp21.txt
THE,bp21.txt
HE DIFFICULTY of understanding the southern lynching spirit soon,bp21.txt
disappears after one has had a better acquaintance with actual racial,bp21.txt
"onditions. For instance, in Florida recently, a moh lynched a white man",bp21.txt
for participating in a shooting feud with another white neighbor. The Negro,bp21.txt
huste suppressed. And the lynching of white business men is undoubtedly,bp21.txt
"intended to impress the colored population with the might of the mob,",bp21.txt
"Without the shadow of a doubt, just as soon as the SUB-NORMAL",bp21.txt
colored law breakers hear of the lynching of this white man they will im-,bp21.txt
mediately become normal and safe units of society. It was to overase the,bp21.txt
Negro that the Atlanta mob lynched a Jew last year. So at least southerners,bp21.txt
"have explained lynchings to us. The Georgia lynchers, we have been informed",bp21.txt
"by the ""yellow journals,"" are respectable citizens, members of the church, some",bp21.txt
"of them, and most of them leaders in business-educated and supposed to be",bp21.txt
enlightened.,bp21.txt
This class of people have been the loudest in their wail against the,bp21.txt
"Mexican bandits, who in the main are reckless dare-devils, ignorant and",bp21.txt
irresponsible. A Mexican mob is made up of nen who have during the past,bp21.txt
"few years lived in lawlessness and revolution, murder was a daily pastime.",bp21.txt
and loot and robbery regarded as the right of the victor. The Americans,bp21.txt
"murdered by these Mexican outlaws in the early stages, were where they",bp21.txt
had been warned not to be; where they had no right to be during times of,bp21.txt
stress and revolution. They had been repeatedly told by American authorities,bp21.txt
to get out of danger and stay out until conditions changed.,bp21.txt
There is quite a little difference between a Georgia mob and a Mexican,bp21.txt
"mob, in Georgia the victims are Negroes mobbed by whites, more often than",bp21.txt
"not, for no particular offense, in Mexico whites were murdered by outlaws.",bp21.txt
"The one is killed while supposedly under the protection of their own flag, in",bp21.txt
"their own country, the other is killed on foreign soil under the flag of the",bp21.txt
highwayman and the professional murderer. There must be some good people,bp21.txt
"in Georgia, but if they lift their voice in condemnation of the men who ruth-",bp21.txt
lessly kill their own fellow citizens and set at defiance the laws not only of,bp21.txt
"their state but of the nation, it is not heard beyond the confines of their own",bp21.txt
little circle.,bp21.txt
"In Mexico, even though the government is not responsible for the depre-",bp21.txt
"dations committed by outlaws, it uses every means in its power to hunt down",bp21.txt
the culprits and as promptly as they are found and caught make their punish-,bp21.txt
"mènt fit their crime. The American government, by its silence, gives encourage-",bp21.txt
ment to this form of lawlessness. Mexican bandits are afraid to come out in,bp21.txt
"the open, American mobs are hailed as ""best citizens."" This explains in a",bp21.txt

"pearance when wanted. A quarrel ensued, pistols",bp28.txt

after a mob lynched one of his relatives. After he,bp28.txt
was indicted he was granted a change of venue. In,bp28.txt
Savannah he was sentenced to be hanged. The higher,bp28.txt
court set aside the verdict and granted a new trial.,bp28.txt
On this occasion he was acquitted.,bp28.txt
"INDICTED again for the murder of Officer Brown,",bp28.txt
he was tried on Nov. 18. 1920. Again he was was,bp28.txt
"arquitted, but so strong was public sentiment against",bp28.txt
him that he was convicted of manslaughter and sen-,bp28.txt
tenced to 15 years in the penitentiary. The court of,bp28.txt

Even if congress should pass an anti-lynch-,bp31.txt

Impasse of Local Sentiment.,bp51.txt
T IS MUCH EASIER to describe the breakdown of,bp51.txt
the law than to suggest a remédy. Some people,bp51.txt
are of the opinion that now is a propitious time to,bp51.txt
renew agitation for the passage of a Federal anti-,bp51.txt
lynching law. I am in full sympathy with the more-,bp51.txt
"ment, but doubt that there is much hope of getting",bp51.txt
such a law enacted. Mass disorder is no longer sec-,bp51.txt
tional; it is courtry-wide. The same public approva!,bp51.txt
that prevents sheriffs and militiamen from effectively,bp51.txt
resisting lynchers is likely to prevent congressmen,bp51.txt
from making it a Federal crime.,bp51.txt

If an anti-lynching law is passed by Congress the,bp51.txt
problem of enforcement will not be an easy one to,bp51.txt
solve. Such a law would give the President the right,bp51.txt
to employ Federal troops to protect a man from a,bp51.txt
"mob, an authority which he does not possess at pres-",bp51.txt
"ent, and professional soldiers would not hesitate to",bp51.txt
fire on a mob if it were necessary. But the army is too,bp51.txt
small to perform that kind of police work and the,bp51.txt
actual defense of prisoners would fall on the shoulders,bp51.txt
of Federal marshals. The marshals would have to,bp51.txt
deputize citizens of the community where the prisoner,bp51.txt
needed protection and the deputies would be subject,bp51.txt
to the same local influences which now paralyze sher-,bp51.txt
"iffs, state troopers and militia. Members of mets",bp51.txt
"would have to be tried before local juries, too; a fact",bp51.txt
that would make it practically impossible to obtain a,bp51.txt

Unless something is quickly done to bring liberal forces,bp51.txt

That only a negligible few of the,bp53.txt
"more than 200,000 Negroes of our",bp53.txt

The citation of the existence of,bp53.txt
the Educational Equality League,bp53.txt
and its lack of racial support is,bp53.txt
made only to ask one question:,bp53.txt
Why have many of us failed to sup-,bp53.txt
port this and similar organizations,bp53.txt
that are fighting for our legal,bp53.txt
"rights, and against illegal discrim",bp53.txt
ination against and segregation of,bp53.txt
us? It certainly is not because the,bp53.txt
majority of us believe in segrega-,bp53.txt
"tion, but simply because we reason",bp53.txt
that inasmuch as the institution of,bp53.txt
segregation has become so firmly,bp53.txt
intrenched among us that it is vain,bp53.txt
"and impossible for us to abolish it,",bp53.txt
"in spite of laws to the contrary,",bp53.txt
and still others who are opposed to,bp53.txt
"the institution, do not exert them-",bp53.txt
selves in opposition thereto for the,bp53.txt
reason that they fear that it will,bp53.txt
endanger their already insecure,bp53.txt
economic security or jobs to be,bp53.txt
more explicit. But both these rea-,bp53.txt
"sons are unsound, for in the first",bp53.txt
instance,bp53.txt
any rublio institution,bp53.txt
'which is contrary to established,bp53.txt
law is illegal and therefore subject,bp53.txt
to and possible of abolition; and in,bp53.txt
the second instance very few Ne-,bp53.txt
groes have lost their jobs for con-,bp53.txt
tending for their civil and public,bp53.txt
"rights, which were bestowed on",bp53.txt
them by none other than the so-,bp53.txt
called dominant group.,bp53.txt
In deciding,bp53.txt
the,bp53.txt
question of,bp53.txt
whether Negroes should accept or,bp53.txt
"reject segregation, the arguments",bp53.txt
advanced should be based upon,bp53.txt
state law and on the merits or de-,bp53.txt
"merits of the case. For instance,",bp53.txt
in Pennsylvania the legislative act,bp53.txt
establishing a public school sys-,bp53.txt
tem did not establish a separate,bp53.txt
system for the Negro and white,bp53.txt
races. And it specifically prohibits,bp53.txt
in section 1405 of the School Code,bp53.txt
any distinction on account of race,bp53.txt
"or color. Therefore, in Pennsylva-",bp53.txt
nia there is but one way of decid-,bp53.txt
ing the school segregation issue and,bp53.txt
that is on the basis of existing,bp53.txt
laws. All other grounds for décid-,bp53.txt
ing the issue in this state must be,bp53.txt
"relegated to the future, until, at",bp53.txt
such time the Negroes decide to,bp53.txt
agitate for the repeal of present,bp53.txt
equal educational laws. So the,bp53.txt
question of segregated schools in,bp53.txt
Pennsylvania is already decided,bp53.txt
by law.,bp53.txt
Now it is well to examine at least,bp53.txt
some of the supposed merits of,bp53.txt
segregation in our schools. Pro-,bp53.txt
segregationists argue that the col-,bp53.txt
ored children fare better under Ne,bp53.txt
gro teachers. That this is true by,bp53.txt
reason of the fact that the raco,bp53.txt
teachers better understand the Ne-,bp53.txt
gro child and his needs. Although,bp53.txt
the first argument that the Negro,bp53.txt
children fare better under their,bp53.txt
own teachers is true to a certain,bp53.txt
"extent, it is also true that the Ne-",bp53.txt
gro school by virtue of its inade-,bp53.txt
quate provision and consequent in-,bp53.txt
"equality, especially as they exist in",bp53.txt
the South and must inevitably ex-,bp53.txt
ist everywhere else where the sy9-,bp53.txt
"tem of segregation is complete,",bp53.txt
cannot do otherwise than turn out,bp53.txt
an Inferiorly educated child. A,bp53.txt
very concrete example of this was,bp53.txt
a Negro child of my acquaintance,bp53.txt
who graduated from a so-called ac-,bp53.txt
credited southern high school. He,bp53.txt
applied for admission to Temple,bp53.txt
"University, but was rejected on the",bp53.txt
ground that Temple could only,bp53.txt
recognize two years of his four,bp53.txt
years high school course. The con-,bp53.txt
sequence was that he had to go,bp53.txt
back to high school for two more,bp53.txt
years! Imagine six years of high,bp53.txt
"school, which was all the result of",bp53.txt
"a segregated system of education,",bp53.txt
with in many respects under-,bp53.txt
trained and underpaid teachers.,bp53.txt
Again it sometimes happens in,bp53.txt
the segregated school that the sys-,bp53.txt
tem of school supervision is not ac-,bp53.txt
cording to the rules as rigidly en-,bp53.txt
forced as it is in the white school.,bp53.txt
There is resultantly much class,bp53.txt
"room laxity, such as passing a",bp53.txt
"child from one grade to another,",bp53.txt
"regardless of merit; and also, in",bp53.txt
many instances favoritism has too,bp53.txt
often found its way into the class,bp53.txt
"rooms of the separate school, re-",bp53.txt
sulting in the unmerited advance-,bp53.txt
ment of many of the children of,bp53.txt
the favored few. So it is clear,bp53.txt
that regardless of this better un-,bp53.txt
derstanding on the part of the Ne-,bp53.txt
gro teacher of the Negro child and,bp53.txt
"his needs, that such does not and",bp53.txt
cannot in many cases result in a,bp53.txt
race child faring better. Perhaps,bp53.txt
such would be the case if the Ne-,bp53.txt
gro teacher taught in the same,bp53.txt
school with his white associate.,bp53.txt
Then he would undoubtedly be able,bp53.txt
to communicate some of his un,bp53.txt
derstanding of the Negro child to,bp53.txt
his colleagues of the opposite,bp53.txt
group.,bp53.txt
admission,bp53.txt
evidently.,bp53.txt
schools.,bp53.txt
Another convincing example of.,bp53.txt
the handicap of the segregated,bp53.txt
school to the Negro student which,bp53.txt
comes from the birthplace of seg-,bp53.txt
"regation, the south, is one of a Ne-",bp53.txt
gro girl who graduated from a,bp53.txt
"group 1, class A, state of North",bp53.txt
"Carolina, approved high school.",bp53.txt
She graduated in the upper three-,bp53.txt
"quarters of her class, which would",bp53.txt
have entitled ber to admission,bp53.txt
without an entrance examination,bp53.txt
as was the policy in the,bp53.txt
of white students from,bp53.txt
the same standing of high,bp53.txt
At least this is what Dr. J. Henry,bp53.txt
Highsmith of the department of,bp53.txt
public instruction of the state of,bp53.txt
"North Carolina wrote to me. Hence,",bp53.txt
"segregated schools, even those that",bp53.txt
have a competent faculty of teach-,bp53.txt
"ers, but who are more or less re-",bp53.txt
"stricted, cannot be anything else in",bp53.txt
the end but a handicap to the Ne,bp53.txt
gro students.,bp53.txt
With respect to the economic ar,bp53.txt
gument for segregated schools that,bp53.txt
it affords employment to a number,bp53.txt
"of Negro teachers, this too must",bp53.txt
be conceded.,bp53.txt
But on,bp53.txt
"hand, especially in states like Penn-",bp53.txt
sylvania with equal educational,bp53.txt
"laws, the Negro teacher has the",bp53.txt
legal opportunity of teaching in,bp53.txt
"any school. However, they are not",bp53.txt
to be blamed for taking advantage,bp53.txt
of this one opportunity of teaching,bp53.txt
"in any school. However, they are",bp53.txt

tage of this one opportunity of,bp53.txt
"teaching in any school. However,",bp53.txt
they are not to be blamed for tak-,bp53.txt
ing advantage of this one oppor,bp53.txt
tunity of practicing their profes-,bp53.txt
"sion even in a segregated school,",bp53.txt
when the Negro masses are doing,bp53.txt
nothing to bring about enforce-,bp53.txt
ment of the law which gives them,bp53.txt
equal teaching privileges and the,bp53.txt
opportunity to teach in any school.,bp53.txt
the other,bp53.txt
I do not,bp53.txt
In making this statement,bp53.txt
mean that Negro teachers and prin-,bp53.txt
cipals are justified in upholding the,bp53.txt
system of school segregation and,bp53.txt
justifying ita existence by baseless,bp53.txt
reasons. They should quietly and,bp53.txt
efficiently pursue their teaching,bp53.txt
without at any time attempting to,bp53.txt
hinder any fight that the com-,bp53.txt
munity may make in behalf of,bp53.txt
equal teaching opportunities for,bp53.txt
them. In the state where segrega-,bp53.txt
tion has been established by state,bp53.txt
"law, as for instance in the south,",bp53.txt
if the Negrocs in those states de-,bp53.txt
"sire mixed schools, then it should",bp53.txt
be by means of agitation for repeal,bp53.txt
of the state law which has estab-,bp53.txt
lished the segregated institution.,bp53.txt
come,bp53.txt
Still another reason of the advo-,bp53.txt
cates of separate schools is that,bp53.txt
while teachers are naturally preju,bp53.txt
diced against Negroes and that,bp53.txt
they naturally as a result must be,bp53.txt
blased and unfair in their judgment,bp53.txt
of the scholastic ratings of the Ne-,bp53.txt
"gro child. However, this may ""d",bp53.txt
"true, there is ample proof in th",bp53.txt
numerous graduations of our gir s,bp53.txt
and boys from mixed schools th .t,bp53.txt
such is not generally the case. And,bp53.txt
if competent and efficient colored,bp53.txt
teachers were teaching in the me,bp53.txt
actools such a policy would,bp53.txt
even more neglible than it is today.,bp53.txt
It is manifest that any institu-,bp53.txt
tion which has so evidently im-,bp53.txt
proved the relations between the,bp53.txt
white ard Negro races as the,bp53.txt
"mixed school system, should be re-",bp53.txt
tained by all means regardless of,bp53.txt
its resultant betterment of inter-,bp53.txt
racial understanding ought to out-,bp53.txt
weigh all other considerations,bp53.txt
"whose effect is merely racial, espe-",bp53.txt
cially in a country where it is im-,bp53.txt
possibie for the Negro to isolate,bp53.txt

"peopie. And even then, if he could",bp53.txt
"so isol: te himself, he would soon",bp53.txt

races of mankind are so depend-,bp53.txt
"ent one on the other, that not one",bp53.txt
of them can prosper and in most,bp53.txt

ing stage of the world such might,bp53.txt
"have been possible, but not in this",bp53.txt

Certainly it seems to me that the,bp53.txt

ly convinced that it is not the best,bp53.txt

And these are only some of the,bp53.txt
places where the monster of race,bp53.txt

"On October 18th, in the year of",bp53.txt

In the midst of the construction,bp57.txt
r. Dendy received a warning. It,bp57.txt
was an anonymous letter decorated,bp57.txt
with skull and bones. It read:,bp57.txt
"You look good to us, if you build",bp57.txt

it is possible that his youth gave him,bp62.txt

"to file a divorce petition. The white neighbors of Mr. Hull, incensed",bp78.txt

all the other anti-lynching bills that followed.,bp78.txt
It is surprising how loud these southerners can boller when the,bp78.txt
shoe is pinching their foot. I deplore inhuman treatment of any per-,bp78.txt
son or race of people. It is indeed unfortunate that America has stood,bp78.txt
"for so much savagery within its own borders that, now when it cries",bp78.txt

enemies can so conveniently point to its own sins.,bp78.txt

commit any crimes to justify their lynching and burning at the stake.,bp78.txt
No doubt the Germans and Japs learned much of their horrible tech-,bp78.txt

questions that should be,bp100.txt
considered.,bp100.txt

assimilated into the main-,bp100.txt
stream culture that they no,bp100.txt

adequately serving today's,bp100.txt
black readers and whether,bp100.txt
they have reacted to this,bp100.txt
coverage or lack of it by,bp100.txt
withdrawing their support?,bp100.txt
It is quite clear that its,bp100.txt
survival is in the hands of,bp100.txt
black people. They can,bp100.txt
decide whether to support,bp100.txt
black publications or,bp100.txt
abandon them.,bp100.txt
a,bp100.txt
black,bp100.txt
It can never forget that it,bp100.txt

than ever. The combined,bp100.txt

in excess of 2 million,bp100.txt

The decade that,bp100.txt

"Lynching is defined as mob execution, usually",bp106.txt
"by hanging, without the benefit of trial and often",bp106.txt
accompanied with torture and body mutilation. The,bp106.txt
"usual scenario included a mob of up to 5,000 white",bp106.txt
"men attacking a single, defenseless black man and",bp106.txt
executing him for a crime he was never convicted of,bp106.txt
or even charged with in most cases. Lynching is,bp106.txt
considered one of the most horrific chapters in,bp106.txt
African American history and can only compared to,bp106.txt
slavery in cruelty and savagery toward another,bp106.txt
human being.,bp106.txt
"Ironically, the term ""lynch"" is derived from the",bp106.txt
"name of Charles Lynch, a Virginia planter and",bp106.txt
"patriot during the American Revolution, who di-",bp106.txt
rected violence toward white British loyalists. After,bp106.txt
"the Civil War and emancipation, lynching became",bp106.txt
almost synonymous with hanging and torturing Af-,bp106.txt
rican American males. Between 1882 and 1930,bp106.txt
"more than 3,300 black male victims were hanged.",bp106.txt
"burned alive, castrated and mutilated by mostly",bp106.txt
Southern white mobs who have never faced any,bp106.txt
charges for these criminal acts. Coroners and law,bp106.txt
officials typically attributed the murders to “partics,bp106.txt
"unknown."" Most historians and sociologists agree",bp106.txt
that mob execution was really about social control,bp106.txt
and to maintain the status quo of white superiority,bp106.txt
and had little to do with crime control.,bp106.txt
Ida B. Wells (1862-1931) could easily be called,bp106.txt
the mother of the anti-lynching movement. She was,bp106.txt
the first of eight children born to slave parents in,bp106.txt
"Holly Springs, Miss. After emancipation, she at-",bp106.txt
tended several schools run by Northern Methodist,bp106.txt

"her parents, she moved to Memphis, Tenn.. with the",bp106.txt
younger children and accepted a teaching position.,bp106.txt
"Because of her great concern for racial injustice,",bp106.txt
Wells was invited to write for a local church paper.,bp106.txt
"As her fame increased, she was asked to contribute",bp106.txt
to several Baptist newspapers. She eventually be-,bp106.txt
came editor and partner of the Free Speech and,bp106.txt
Headlight Baptist newspaper.,bp106.txt
"In 1892, the brutal lynching of three close friends",bp106.txt
"in Memphis started Wells on a militant, uncompro-",bp106.txt
"mising, single-minded crusade against lynching from",bp106.txt
which she would never retreat. Her three friends,bp106.txt
"committed the crime of opening a grocery store,",bp106.txt
which successfully competed with a white grocer,bp106.txt
directly across the street. For the crime of becoming,bp106.txt
"too ""uppity,"" a large white mob took the three",bp106.txt
"proprietors from their grocery store, tortured and",bp106.txt
killed them. Wells wrote angry editorials in her,bp106.txt
newspaper encouraging blacks to leave Memphis if,bp106.txt
"possible and to boycott white businesses, which left",bp106.txt
"several white companies, including the newly opened",bp106.txt
"streetcar line, on the verge of bankruptcy.",bp106.txt
Wells decided to launch her anti-lynching move-,bp106.txt
ment on several fronts. She first wanted to explode,bp106.txt
the myth that lynching was primarily to protect white,bp106.txt
women from rape by black men. She published de-,bp106.txt
tailed statistics on lynching which demonstrated that,bp106.txt
less than one-fifth of the victims of lynch mobs were,bp106.txt
even accused of rape by their killers. She said that,bp106.txt
"racist southern white mobs ""cry rape"" to brand their",bp106.txt
"victims as ""moral monsters"" and to place them ""be-",bp106.txt
"yond the pale of human sympathy.""",bp106.txt
She wrote that while Southern white men raped,bp106.txt
"black women and children with impunity, they con-",bp106.txt
sidered any liaison between a black man and a white,bp106.txt
woman as involuntary by definition. She pointed out,bp106.txt
that children produced by white-black relationships,bp106.txt
"were called ""mulatto” from the Spanish word for",bp106.txt
mule because racist whites believed that mixed-race,bp106.txt
"children, like the offspring of donkeys and horses,",bp106.txt
were an inferior breed that could not reproduce.,bp106.txt

Ida B. Wells (1862-1931) could easily be called,bp109.txt

"Because of her great concern for racial injustice,",bp109.txt
Wells was invited to write for a local church paper.,bp109.txt
"As her fame increased, she was asked to contribute",bp109.txt

"too ""uppity,"" a large white mob took the three",bp109.txt
"proprietors from their grocery store, tortured and",bp109.txt

Wells decided to launch her anti-lynching move-,bp109.txt

the myth that lynching was primarily to protect white,bp109.txt
women from rape by black men. She published de-,bp109.txt
tailed statistics on lynching which demonstrated that,bp109.txt
less than one-fifth of the victims of lynch mobs were,bp109.txt
even accused of rape by their killers. She said that,bp109.txt
"racist southern white mobs ""cry rape"" to brand their",bp109.txt

"yond the pale of human sympathy.""",bp109.txt
She wrote that while Southern white men raped,bp109.txt
"black women and children with impunity, they con-",bp109.txt
sidered any liaison between a black man and a white,bp109.txt
woman as involuntary by definition. She pointed out,bp109.txt
that children produced by white-black relationships,bp109.txt

The racial bias within the,bp113.txt
statistics on capital punishment,bp113.txt
speaks for itself. Although Blacks,bp113.txt
comprised about nine percent of the,bp113.txt
"U.S. population in the 1930s, almost",bp113.txt
50 percent of all prisoners who were,bp113.txt

Afro-Americans. 97.1 percent of all,bp113.txt
whites executed had been convicted,bp113.txt
for murder. Only 10 white men were,bp113.txt
executed for rape during the entire,bp113.txt
ten year period. 115 Black men were,bp113.txt
"sentenced to die for rape in the 1930s,",bp113.txt

Advocates of capital punishment,bp113.txt
found themselves on the defensive in,bp113.txt

"between 1928 and 1949, the average",bp113.txt
homicide rates in states that allowed,bp113.txt

tionship between capital punishment,bp113.txt
and crime deterrence. The public,bp113.txt
was told repepeatedly that capital,bp113.txt

Anti-Lynch Measures Measures Lynch-,bp150.txt
-By COUNCILMAN EARL BROWN BROWN EARL COUNCILMAN,bp150.txt
1,bp150.txt
After a painstaking investigation the FSI,bp150.txt
presented Gov. J. P. Coleman of Mississippi with,bp150.txt
the list of names of the mob members who,bp150.txt
lynched Mack Parker in Poplarville a few weeks,bp150.txt
ago. The Chief Executive of the Sovereign State,bp150.txt
of Ignorance and Bigotry stuck the list in his,bp150.txt
"pocket, announced that he would give it to the",bp150.txt
grand jury when it convenes next November and,bp150.txt
then caught a plane for Washington to testify,bp150.txt
against civil rights legislation now pending in,bp150.txt
"Congress,",bp150.txt
Although Gov. Coleman had bleated boister-,bp150.txt
ously against lynching when Parker was spirited,bp150.txt
away from his jail cell by the mob and beaten,bp150.txt
and shot until he was dead. everyone knew that,bp150.txt
he was talking through his wool hat and that,bp150.txt
he really was on the side of,bp150.txt
the lynchers. If he hadn't,bp150.txt
"been, he would have ordered",bp150.txt
a grand jury convened the,bp150.txt
"second the FBI gave him, the",bp150.txt
"list of names of the lynchers,",bp150.txt
presented it to them and de-,bp150.txt
manded immediate action.,bp150.txt
He would not have ducked,bp150.txt
out to Washington to defend,bp150.txt
lynching and denounce civil,bp150.txt
rights legislation.,bp150.txt
"Parker is gone, his body is",bp150.txt
"cold and rotting, in the Mississippi earth. but",bp150.txt
Coleman is still around making it safe for fu-,bp150.txt
ture lynchers to do their dastardly deeds. Not,bp150.txt
only is Parker gone but he is almost forgotten.,bp150.txt
But as I have said before it wasn't only Parker,bp150.txt
but the entire Negro race in the U. S. was,bp150.txt
lynched when the mob struck. This is how Cole-,bp150.txt
man and his mobsters wanted it and this is how,bp150.txt
they have it. Nobody is stopping them.,bp150.txt
Killed Section 3,bp150.txt
There would be a good chance of stopping,bp150.txt
them if there were a federal law that would,bp150.txt
guarantee the security of a person from lynch-,bp150.txt
ers. Back in 1957 when a civil rights bill was in-,bp150.txt
"troduced in Congress, it included a section (num-",bp150.txt
ber 3 which empowered the federal government,bp150.txt
"to step in, investigate, take over and prosecute",bp150.txt
mobsters charged with violating the personal,bp150.txt
security of any citizen. It was aimed directly,bp150.txt
at protecting the rights of Negroes in the South.,bp150.txt
Because the Southern senators threatened to,bp150.txt
"filibuster the bill to death, the Republican and",bp150.txt
the Northern Democratic senators killed section,bp150.txt
3 and passed a weak-tea-with-milk bill which,bp150.txt
was intended to get the politicians off the hook,bp150.txt
with the Negro voters. The bill isn't worth a,bp150.txt
hill of Mississippi mud.,bp150.txt
What has made the post-mortem actions in,bp150.txt
the Mack Parker case so cynical and hypocritical,bp150.txt
is that the FBI quickly moved in when he was,bp150.txt
"lynched, thoroughly investigated the crime and",bp150.txt
"came up with the names of the killers. Yet, all",bp150.txt
"they could do, according to the Department of",bp150.txt
"Justice, was to turn over the names to the Gov.",bp150.txt
"of Mississippi, who has been one of the chief",bp150.txt
fomenters of lynching and mob violence ever,bp150.txt
since he was sworn in. He has inveighed against,bp150.txt
"school integration and for white supremacy, thus",bp150.txt

Which they have done.,bp150.txt

Congress now has a number of civil rights,bp150.txt
bills in its hopper. The one supported by Presi-,bp150.txt
dent Eisenhower has carefully omitted a guaran-,bp150.txt
tee of personal security of the individual. So has,bp150.txt
the one slipped in by Senate Majority Leader,bp150.txt
"Lyndon Johnson. On the other hand, the Douglas-",bp150.txt
Javits-Celler bill definitely has a section about,bp150.txt
personal security of the individual citizen.,bp150.txt
In view of the Parker lynching and continu-,bp150.txt
"ous racial unrest in the South, it is mandatory",bp150.txt
that Congress pass the Douglas-Javits-Celler,bp150.txt
civil right bill.,bp150.txt
Anything less would be nothing at all. If sec-,bp150.txt
"tion three, the personal security section. had not",bp150.txt
"been deleted from the civil rights bill of '57, the",bp150.txt
U. S. Government would have been able to act,bp150.txt
in the Mack Parker case. The persons named by,bp150.txt
the FBI would have been arrested and charged,bp150.txt
with the crime of lynching. At least justice would,bp150.txt
have gotten started. This is more than what,bp150.txt
happens in similar cases.,bp150.txt
The chances of Congress passing a civil rights,bp150.txt
"bill with teeth are slim, however. The President.",bp150.txt
who has kept tongue in check during the Mack,bp150.txt

alive is to go into action against his tormentors,bp150.txt
himself.,bp150.txt

The withdrawal of the Federal Bureau of Investigation from,bp151.txt
"the Poplarville, Miss. mob-lynch case clearly demonstrates the",bp151.txt
need for anti-lynching legislation. It is recognized that the,bp151.txt
agency did an exhaustive investigation into the death of Mack,bp151.txt
"Charles Parker, but found no evidence that federal law was",bp151.txt
violated. Undoubtedly the FBI was working in a limited area of,bp151.txt
authority. It is commendable that its findings have been made,bp151.txt
available to Gov. James H. Coleman.,bp151.txt
It is unmistakeably clear that the power of the FBI must,bp151.txt
be broadened to deal with mob violence. Congress must act,bp151.txt
speedily to give the Department of Justice the right to seek,bp151.txt
federal. indictments of those who would take the law in their,bp151.txt

of justice and decency by summoning a special grand jury to,bp151.txt

prestige in the United States as well as throughout the civilized,bp151.txt

"When four persons were lynched in Monroe, no namics",bp151.txt

T,bp175.txt
-HE question has been raised,bp175.txt
whether the death of Emmett Louis,bp175.txt
Till. 15-year-old Chicago Negro who,bp175.txt
was slain in Mississippi for whistling at a,bp175.txt
"white woman, should be classified as",bp175.txt

tional Association for the Advancement of,bp175.txt
Colored People says that he was lynched.,bp175.txt
Which is right? The answer lies in how,bp175.txt
but the definitions ·,bp175.txt
lynching is defined,bp175.txt
"are not, admittedly, very precise.",bp175.txt
"It does seem clear that the boy was, at",bp175.txt
"least, killed in the lynch 'spirit. He was",bp175.txt
slain because he had committed an act of,bp175.txt
indiscretion that ran counter to Mississippi,bp175.txt
ways of life which have almost the sanc-,bp175.txt
"tion of law. Had he been white, he could.",bp175.txt
"have done the same thing with impunity,",bp175.txt
or at least he most certainly would not,bp175.txt
have paid for it with his life.,bp175.txt
J,bp175.txt
One characteristic of lynching is that,bp175.txt
it is punishment outside established chan-,bp175.txt
nels of justice. There is no question but,bp175.txt
that the death qualified as a lynching in,bp175.txt
this one respect.,bp175.txt

S,bp175.txt
Some authoritative sources,bp175.txt
say that,bp175.txt
lynching in its modern form need not be,bp175.txt
perpetrated by a mob. The Encyclopedia,bp175.txt
of the Social Sciences defines lynching as,bp175.txt
"""a vengeful torture and execution of indi-",bp175.txt
viduals without trial and regardless of the,bp175.txt
existence of regular courts of law. In a,bp175.txt
broader sense lynch law is sometimes em-,bp175.txt
ployed with reference to any form of ex-,bp175.txt
tralegal action for inflicting corporal,bp175.txt
"punishment.""",bp175.txt
A well-known sociology text (Race Re-,bp175.txt
lations by Dr. Brewton Berry) first defines,bp175.txt
lynching as 'execution by a mob without,bp175.txt
"trial . . . of an individual who is suspected,",bp175.txt
convicted or accused of a violation of laws,bp175.txt
"or mores."" But Berry goes on to say that",bp175.txt
"there are those who feel that ""lynching.",bp175.txt
has been driven underground and that,bp175.txt
certain substitutes have arisen to take its,bp175.txt
"place."" Among these, he lists ""murder by",bp175.txt
small quiet groups rather than by noisy,bp175.txt
"mobs.""",bp175.txt
Lynching originally was associated with,bp175.txt

When the jury of 12 white men brought in its,bp232.txt
verdict in the South Carolina lynching trial last,bp232.txt
"week, 13 glum Negroes were seated in the gallery of",bp232.txt
"the yellow brick courthouse. They were, in a way,",bp232.txt
"svmbols of the protest of their entire race of 15,000,-",bp232.txt
000 citizens against the wanton,bp232.txt
flaunting of justice by the jury.,bp232.txt
They were living svmbols of muti-,bp232.txt
lated Willie Earle who was spirit-,bp232.txt
ed from the Greenville jail and,bp232.txt
taken out on the roadside in the,bp232.txt
dark of night and lynched. They,bp232.txt
were the important people in the,bp232.txt
"courtroom, for it is they and all",bp232.txt
other Negro citizens who are often,bp232.txt
subjected to the cruelties of race,bp232.txt
prejudice. The white race was on,bp232.txt
trial and the 13 solitary Negroes,bp232.txt
were sitting in judgment.,bp232.txt
The miscarriage of justice in,bp232.txt
the notorious lynch case was em-,bp232.txt
all the more because of the impeccable man,bp232.txt
and told him that he was ashamed to be a member,bp232.txt
of the same profession as the defense attorney who,bp232.txt
appealed to racial and sectional prejudice at the,bp232.txt
trial. A white man testified for the state against,bp232.txt
the defendants. He was beaten up for doing so.,bp232.txt

"in Greenville, he would be run out of town. All of",bp232.txt
the things may be taken as progressive signs of the,bp232.txt
time.,bp232.txt
Another interesting point that was brought out,bp232.txt
in the trial was the amount of schooling some of,bp232.txt
the defendants had acquired. One of them could,bp232.txt
neither read nor write and two of them had been,bp232.txt
only to the second grade. It seems to be obvious,bp232.txt
that all of the defendants were not only bigoted but,bp232.txt
also utterly without education. This is significant,bp232.txt
because although the lack of education of thern,bp232.txt
Negroes is always emphasized as a reason for their,bp232.txt
"alleged wrong-doing, it is never brought out as a",bp232.txt
reason why southern whites act like beasts.,bp232.txt
"It should not be assumed, however, that educated",bp232.txt
"people are not bigoted and prejudiced. They are,",bp232.txt
and because they are they are indirectly the cause,bp232.txt
of lynchings and other crimes perpetrated against,bp232.txt
"Negroes, Jews, and other citizens.",bp232.txt

FAILURE AT HATTIESBURG AT HATTIESBURG,bp333.txt
EDITOR'S NOTE-The following editorial from the 8t. Louis,bp333.txt
Etar-Times presents such a pointed observation that entirely agress,bp333.txt
with the position of The Pittsburgh Courier that it is reproduced,bp333.txt
here as our lead editorial. It is one of the strongest editorials,bp333.txt
to come out of the South-Central States and we congratulate the,bp333.txt
Star-Times on its forthright stand.,bp333.txt
The Federal Government's first effort to attack lynch-,bp333.txt
ing by prosecution under the civil rights laws failed Sat-,bp333.txt
urday when a Hattiesburg (Miss.) jury acquitted three,bp333.txt
defendants accused of complicity in the lynching of How-,bp333.txt
"ard Wash, a Negro. But there is a stain against America",bp333.txt
and the State of Mississippi which is not wiped out by,bp333.txt
this verdict.,bp333.txt
Howard Wash was a convicted murderer. A jury,bp333.txt
"of white men, finding him guilty of killing his white",bp333.txt
"employer, ; nevertheless had felt that mitigating circum-",bp333.txt
"stances barred the death penalty. That verdict, con-",bp333.txt
"sidering the social system of the South, spoke eloquently.",bp333.txt
Yet while Wash was awaiting sentence to life imprison-,bp333.txt
"ment, a mob broke into the jail and lynched him.",bp333.txt
Does anyone doubt that this Negro's rights as a,bp333.txt
human being were violated by the mob? The courts were,bp333.txt
"flouted, the processes of justice were overturned, and",bp333.txt
verdict of a white man's jury was destroyed.. Equal,bp333.txt
"protection of the laws became a meaningless phrase,",bp333.txt
twisted and mocked by lynchers.,bp333.txt
The Federal Department of Justice intervened in,bp333.txt
this case only after decades of experience showing that,bp333.txt
State law is powerless to punish a lynch mob. We have,bp333.txt
had proof of that ugly fact in Missouri. Now the Fed-,bp333.txt
eral Government itself has failed at Hattiesburg. A,bp333.txt
Federal district judge ruled that the government was,bp333.txt
"within its rights in bringing the action, but attorneys",bp333.txt
for the defense waved the bloody shirt of Civil War,bp333.txt
"memories, cried out about States' rights, and a local",bp333.txt
jury acquitted the local defendants.,bp333.txt
The jury acquitted one of the accused although his,bp333.txt
"signed confession, admitting to the FBI that he had",bp333.txt
"been a member of the mob, was introduced in evidence,",bp333.txt
"and despite his failure to take the stand, in the presence",bp333.txt
"of the jury, to repudiate the confession or submit to",bp333.txt
government cross-examination.,bp333.txt
"Not Mississippi alone, but the whole United States,",bp333.txt
is disgraced in the eyes of the world when a human being,bp333.txt
can be lynched and his mob murder go unpunished. The,bp333.txt
debacle at Hattiesburg is a sign of the enormous dis-,bp333.txt

stood on the scaffold a messenger arrived from,91020_0.txt
General Dodge promising him immunity if he,91020_0.txt

the hanging knew anything unusual,91025_0.txt
"was about to occur, and it was fully",91025_0.txt

crime.,91025_0.txt

a leader whose commands were,91025_0.txt

mob arrived at the jail they sought,91025_0.txt
these officers and before they could,91025_0.txt
offer resistance they were helpless.,91025_0.txt
While it is believed that Leberg was,91025_0.txt
"insane, the feeling against the man",91025_0.txt
intense that the avengers,91025_0.txt
was so,91025_0.txt

The people of the city generally believed,91025_0.txt
that the attempt to lynch Le.,91025_0.txt

Before Las Animas knew that the,91025_0.txt
man had been hanged Leberg had,91025_0.txt
been dead more than an hour.,91025_0.txt

"sheriff that the prisoner, Leberg. be",91025_0.txt
turned over to them. The demand met,91025_0.txt
with instand refusal.,91025_0.txt
Without further words the leaders,91025_0.txt
of the mob disarmed and overpowered,91025_0.txt
"Sheriff Brown, Marshal McCune and",91025_0.txt
Undersheriff McAffee.,91025_0.txt
The three men were then gagged,91025_0.txt
"and bound, thrown into a cell and left",91025_0.txt
there while the mob began the effort,91025_0.txt
to get Leberg out of the steel cage in,91025_0.txt
which he was confined.,91025_0.txt
The work of the mob last night had,91025_0.txt
made entrance to the jail comparatively,91025_0.txt
easy. All that was left between,91025_0.txt
the mob and the prisoner was the steel,91025_0.txt
"gage, which the mob last night battered",91025_0.txt
in vain.,91025_0.txt
With the fifty men was one who was,91025_0.txt
evidently well acquainted with the,91025_0.txt
mechanism of the lock on the steel,91025_0.txt
cage. The lock last night resisted all,91025_0.txt
"efforts of the mob, but in a few minutes",91025_0.txt
tonight the locksmith of the party,91025_0.txt
managed to break it and effect an entrance,91025_0.txt
to the cell of Leberg.,91025_0.txt
When the avengers arrived at the,91025_0.txt
jail Leberg was in bed.,91025_0.txt
When he,91025_0.txt
"heard them he got up and dressed, and",91025_0.txt
when the men.broke into the cell he,91025_0.txt
met them calmly and allowed the leaders,91025_0.txt
to put a rope around his neck without,91025_0.txt
resistance.,91025_0.txt
"In thirty minutes, that is at 9:15,",91025_0.txt
"Leberg was brought out of the cell,",91025_0.txt
and the rope put around his neck. He,91025_0.txt
was then led by the mob to a telegraph,91025_0.txt
pole in the railroad yards about 150,91025_0.txt
yards from the jail.,91025_0.txt
"Without evidence of excitement, and",91025_0.txt
"with absolutely no noise, the rope was",91025_0.txt
hoisted over an arm of the pole and,91025_0.txt
Leberg was jerked twenty feet off the,91025_0.txt
ground by twenty men.,91025_0.txt
"No shots were fired at the body, and",91025_0.txt
there was absolutely no other demonstration,91025_0.txt
.,91025_0.txt
While it is believed by many that,91025_0.txt

man with a crowbar. So incensed were,91025_1.txt
the men working in the camp at his,91025_1.txt
actions at that time that he was,91025_1.txt
driven out and toid never to return.,91025_1.txt
Then came the stories from the,91025_1.txt
"ranch of George Purvis, where Leberg",91025_1.txt
ate supper the night of the murder. Le-,91025_1.txt
"berg went into the home of Purvis,",91025_1.txt
where he demanded and was given supper,91025_1.txt
. While at the table he was surly,91025_1.txt
and threatened to make trouble. He demanded,91025_1.txt
"lodging, but Purvis was afraid",91025_1.txt
to have the man in the house.,91025_1.txt
He offered Leberg blankets and a,91025_1.txt
"place to sleep in the barn, but this did",91025_1.txt
"not satisfy him, and he went away",91025_1.txt
muttering. Later he built a camp fire,91025_1.txt
"on the bank of the river, and then he",91025_1.txt
came back and set fire to a haystack,91025_1.txt
"which he thought belonged to Purvis,",91025_1.txt
to get revenge.,91025_1.txt
The haystack that he fired belonged,91025_1.txt
"to Lanvenmeyer, and the arrest of Le-",91025_1.txt
berg by him was followed by the unprovoked,91025_1.txt
killing of the farmer with the,91025_1.txt
hammer which Leberg secured from,91025_1.txt
the saddle of the victim's horse. Not,91025_1.txt
"satisfied that he had killed his victim,",91025_1.txt
Leberg went back and securing a knife,91025_1.txt
"from the victim's pocket, almost",91025_1.txt
hacked his head off. He then took$ 30,91025_1.txt

from the of the man he had,91025_1.txt
person,91025_1.txt
"murdered, and rode away on his victim's",91025_1.txt
horse.,91025_1.txt
When he was captured he expressed,91025_1.txt
no remore for his act and even boasted,91025_1.txt
that he had killed a great land owner,91025_1.txt
who refused to give him a place to,91025_1.txt
sleep.,91025_1.txt
Then came one more detail that,91025_1.txt
added to the horror of the crime and,91025_1.txt
the fury of the men who sought to,91025_1.txt
avenge the murder of Lanvenmeyer.,91025_1.txt

A number of convicts had brought,91036_0.txt
pressure to bear in order to secure,91036_0.txt
their release. Among these were Wal-,91036_0.txt
lace. His crime is well known to Canon,91036_0.txt
City people. He is one of the four,91036_0.txt
prisoners who escaped over the back,91036_0.txt

to,91036_0.txt
stabbed Night Captain Rooney,91036_0.txt

frenzied Canon City people who gathered,91036_0.txt

"designated Frank Wallace, who was",91036_0.txt
"sentenced Jan. 26, 1901, for murder.",91036_0.txt
A number of reasons for the pardon,91036_0.txt
"were cited, and the governor stated",91036_0.txt
that he had carefully gone over the,91036_0.txt
case before he arrived at a decision.,91036_0.txt
"Rev. W. S. Rudolph, former pastor",91036_0.txt

quickly.,91036_0.txt

that night in the boiler room.,91036_0.txt
At ten o'clock they were given their,91036_0.txt
lunch in the guard's dining room. After,91036_0.txt

securely tied in the barber shop. Going,91036_0.txt
"to the boiler room, one of the",91036_0.txt
cons applied a bucket of soap to the,91036_0.txt
belting which runs the electric lighting,91036_0.txt
dynamo. This threw the belt and,91036_0.txt
left the place in entire darkness. It,91036_0.txt
was then the desperate four escaped,91036_0.txt
over the back wall by means of a gas,91036_0.txt
pipe hooked over the top of the wall.,91036_0.txt
Much confussion resulted about the,91036_0.txt
pen. The warden and various officers,91036_0.txt
had heard the alarm and were soon on,91036_0.txt
the ground. But the dead night captain,91036_0.txt
had all the keys on his person on,91036_0.txt
"the inside, and there was no way to",91036_0.txt
get in to find out the facts as heretofore,91036_0.txt
stated. It was thought for a while,91036_0.txt
that all the cell.houses had been opened,91036_0.txt
and the yard full of cons were waiting,91036_0.txt
to break for liberty. The alarm,91036_0.txt
had been given by the ringing of the,91036_0.txt
fire bell and blowing of the pen whistle,91036_0.txt
and several well armed citizens,91036_0.txt
soon gathered at the pen.,91036_0.txt
They were stationed on the walls,91036_0.txt
and at several good places to prevent,91036_0.txt
an outbreak.,91036_0.txt
General excitement prevailed throughout,91036_0.txt
the town. Many exagerated rumors,91036_0.txt
were afloat. It was said that the,91036_0.txt
entire penitentiary had broken out,91036_0.txt
and was coming up Main street in a,91036_0.txt
body. Both men and women about,91036_0.txt

disposess them of their dress suits.,91036_0.txt
Many brave(?) men stood on Beech-,91036_0.txt
"er's corner, doing duty as guards and",91036_0.txt
keeping people without arms from going,91036_0.txt
nearer the scene of the supposed,91036_0.txt
"battle. Some others, little more",91036_0.txt
"brave, got as near the pen as Capt.",91036_0.txt
Rockafellow's home. It seemed the further,91036_0.txt
away from the pen the greater,91036_0.txt
the excitement.,91036_0.txt
A later edition of The Weekly Record,91036_0.txt
tells graphically of the greusome,91036_0.txt
aftermath of the escape. Feeling over,91036_0.txt
the killing of Night Captain Rooney,91036_0.txt
ran high. Threats of violence if he,91036_0.txt
was captured were rumored. The following,91036_0.txt
"Friday night, four days after",91036_0.txt

whispered that Reynolds had been run,91036_0.txt
down near Florence and that a carriage,91036_0.txt
was bringing him back to the,91036_0.txt
pen. Guards were stationed at the,91036_0.txt
several approaches to town and a determined,91036_0.txt
mob quietly gathered at,91036_0.txt
Main and First streets. As the rig,91036_0.txt
"crossed the First street bridge, two",91036_0.txt
"shots, the agreed signal, rang out, announcing",91036_0.txt
the prisoner's arrival. At,91036_0.txt
the prison gate the prisoner was demanded,91036_0.txt
",, and the officers in charge,",91036_0.txt
"seeing that resistance was useless,",91036_0.txt
gave the man up. He was taken to the,91036_0.txt
corner of Mais d First streets and,91036_0.txt
a noose adjusted about his neck. He,91036_0.txt
"was given an opportunity to speak,",91036_0.txt
"but would say nothing, except to ask",91036_0.txt
"for a cigarette. The miserable man,",91036_0.txt
wan and haggard from four days of,91036_0.txt
"exposure and fear, was hoisted some",91036_0.txt
"ten feet in the air, then lowered and",91036_0.txt
asked if he had anything to say. Again,91036_0.txt
he refused to talk.,91036_0.txt
Then strong men drew the rope,91036_0.txt
tight and the body was lifted far up,91036_0.txt
towards the cross bars of the pole.,91036_0.txt
Here it was allowed to hang.,91036_0.txt
Not a shot was fired except the signal,91036_0.txt
of approach. The mob dispersed,91036_0.txt
in an orderly way. The next day at,91036_0.txt

being made to lynch Ragland and,91044_0.txt
asked him what the consequences,91044_0.txt

Throughout the day yesterday there,91053_0.txt
was vague unrest in every quarter of,91053_0.txt

was taken from the telegraph pole,91053_0.txt
at 3 o'clock this morning and placed,91053_0.txt
in a little undertaking shop. Through,91053_0.txt
"the forenoon fully 10,000 people saw",91053_0.txt
the body and stood about the city in,91053_0.txt
groups. The police and officials were,91053_0.txt
"worried, but did not know what was",91053_0.txt

Fearful of the consequences of the,91053_0.txt

"by the mayor, the sheriff, two members",91053_0.txt
"of the Board of Public Safety, the county",91053_0.txt
prosecutor and others.,91053_0.txt
As a result of this deliberation a telegram,91053_0.txt

asking for six companies of militia and,91053_0.txt
requesting that the local companies be,91053_0.txt

response to this the mayor received,91053_0.txt
In a telegram to the effect that the,91053_0.txt

time has come in Mississippi,91109_0.txt

pioneer recalls the days when Uncle Sam's soldiers were the ultimate,91111_0.txt
force upon which the settlers relied for protection as they pushed,91111_0.txt

homes in the fertile lands where marauding savages were wont to roam,91111_0.txt
in quest of game and in the pursuit of their long uninterrupted and,91111_0.txt

where civilzation was supposed to exist merely demonstrates the fact,91111_0.txt
"that isolation and selfish assumption make savages, without regard to",91111_0.txt
race or other diversifying influences. That there is more downright outlawry,91111_0.txt
in the South than in the West or the North is due to the isolation,91111_0.txt
"of communities, and the fact that the people thereof imagine that they",91111_0.txt

the furtherance of the interests of others. Law counts for nothing,91111_0.txt
"against savage conviction, hence military force is the only effective and",91111_0.txt

"outsider that many responsible men who wanted order restored, were",91112_0.txt

"Up to the beginning of the present week, the special grand jury at",91112_0.txt

mobs who have retaliated against their persecutors or supposed persecutors,91112_0.txt
with a viciousness aroused by their own danger. The remedy lies in,91112_0.txt

LAWLESSNESS FOR 1906,91116_0.txt
The year that has closed marks in its trail the blood of victims who,91116_0.txt
have met their deaths at the hands of the mob. The number to perish,91116_0.txt
by this distinction from American barbarity was seventy- three. Mis-,91116_0.txt
sissippi takes the lead in the fifteen states where lynching occurred,91116_0.txt
during the year. Colorado managed to squeeze into the bunch of lawless,91116_0.txt
states with a lynching on the last day of the old year. Sixty- nine,91116_0.txt
"of the total strung were Negroes, leaving only three whites who came",91116_0.txt
"to their death in this high- handed way, as one of the totals was a",91116_0.txt
"colored woman. Instead of lynching being put down, it increased over",91116_0.txt
"the previous year, where the total number to meet death without process",91116_0.txt
of law was sixty- five. Fifteen states disgraced themselves in,91116_0.txt

"twenty- one shot in the open; two shot in jail while awaiting for trial,",91116_0.txt

The causes for which these people met their death forms an interesting,91116_0.txt

Denver was disgraced by a lynching on the,91117_2.txt
night of Wednesday the 26th. It can be said,91117_2.txt
however that the victim of the mob was,91117_2.txt
guilty and richly deserved his fate.,91117_2.txt
The man lynched was Dan Arata ho on,91117_2.txt
the day previous while partially intoxicated,91117_2.txt
foully murdered Benjamin C. Lightfoot a,91117_2.txt
highly respected citizen and a member of the,91117_2.txt
G. A. R. Lightfoot was killed in Arata's,91117_2.txt
"saloon near the Union depot, without any",91117_2.txt
"whatever. Arata, who is an",91117_2.txt
provocation,91117_2.txt
"Italian, had been ugly all day and was looking",91117_2.txt
for some one to wreak vengeance upon,91117_2.txt
when Lightfoot dropped into the saloon for a,91117_2.txt
drink of beer on his way home from work.,91117_2.txt
Arata shot and pounded Lightfoot to death,91117_2.txt
and threw the body into an alley. He was,91117_2.txt
arrested but denied committing the crime.,91117_2.txt
Arata had killed a man before and had been,91117_2.txt
Cleared by an alibi sworn to by Italians.,91117_2.txt
There were rumors of a lytichtig during,91117_2.txt
"the day, and at 8 o'clock a party of army",91117_2.txt
veterans and others formed at Eighteenth,91117_2.txt
and Larimer streets and started for the jail,91117_2.txt
for the purpose of avenging Lightfoot's,91117_2.txt
death. As the crowd progressed it was augmented,91117_2.txt
"by thousands of men, crying"" Hang",91117_2.txt
"the Dago.""",91117_2.txt
At Fourteenth street the excitement be-,91117_2.txt
"eame so intense that the crowd began to run,",91117_2.txt
and then the rush to the jail became a perfect,91117_2.txt
"race, each man apparently in the greatest",91117_2.txt
alarm lest some others should get there and,91117_2.txt
rob him of the privilege of assisting at the,91117_2.txt
hideous task. To get to the jail in the shortest,91117_2.txt
"possible time became everybody's alm,",91117_2.txt
and breaking from the original mase great,91117_2.txt
partles of 500 or more swept along every,91117_2.txt
"street, each taking the way that occurred to",91117_2.txt
it as the shortest.,91117_2.txt
At shortly after 9 o'clock the square about,91117_2.txt
the jall was thronged by an excited mob of,91117_2.txt
"more than 10,000 men. The leaders lost no",91117_2.txt
Without a moment's,91117_2.txt
time in speech- making.,91117_2.txt
delay four of them dashed up the steps to the,91117_2.txt
north or main entrance. They were met,91117_2.txt
"there by Captain Crews, who demanded what",91117_2.txt
they wanted.,91117_2.txt
""" We want that brutal fiend of a Dago you've",91117_2.txt
"got here,"" replied the spokesman, in a low",91117_2.txt
"volce."" You'll give him up?""",91117_2.txt
""" I will not,"" was all the jailer said, but his",91117_2.txt
tone evidently meant business and the door,91117_2.txt
closed with a clang.,91117_2.txt
"Then we'll take him,"" yelled the leaders",91117_2.txt
"of the mob, and they explained as best they",91117_2.txt
"could to their pushing, struggling compan-",91117_2.txt
"tons below what Captain Crews had said, and",91117_2.txt
the task that was before them.,91117_2.txt
When the actual work of breaking in was,91117_2.txt
"decided upon, a state of things developed",91117_2.txt
that showed clearly the spontaneous growth,91117_2.txt
of the movement. In the whole mob there,91117_2.txt
was not a tool of even the dimensions of a,91117_2.txt
tack hammer. No one had given a thought,91117_2.txt
to a thing beyond the simple getting of his,91117_2.txt
own person to the scene of action. Now for a,91117_2.txt
few moments all was confusion and uproar.,91117_2.txt
""" A sledge! a sledge!"" a hundred throats",91117_2.txt
"would yell."" Bring a crow or a sledge,""",91117_2.txt
would come the echo from a thousand or,91117_2.txt
"more, but to no one did it seem to occur to go",91117_2.txt
get the tools himself. Then principally,91117_2.txt
for and want of other occupation those on the,91117_2.txt
porch began to tear down the storm doors.,91117_2.txt
In an instant Constable George Welsh was,91117_2.txt
"among them, cuffing and batting them right",91117_2.txt
and left with his fists and kicking the whole,91117_2.txt
dozen or so off the steps altogether. His,91117_2.txt
fearless pluck and determination evidently,91117_2.txt
"awed the mob, and had it been followed up at",91117_2.txt
once by the resolute action of even a dozen,91117_2.txt
"others, the mob, big as it was, could probably",91117_2.txt
have been dispersed without further trouble.,91117_2.txt
"But the support did not come, the proper opportunity",91117_2.txt
was allowed to slip by and from,91117_2.txt
that minute the final result became inevitable,91117_2.txt
.,91117_2.txt
"A strongly- built heavy- set man, evidently a",91117_2.txt
"mechanic, appeared with a crowbar and with",91117_2.txt
him a companion bearing a sledge. Without,91117_2.txt
a word these two tramped up the steps and,91117_2.txt
the next minute a dull thud. followed by a,91117_2.txt
"ringing clank of metal against metal, announced",91117_2.txt
that the first actual blows were,91117_2.txt
struck and the crowd fairly shrieked with delighted,91117_2.txt
satisfaction.,91117_2.txt
Then blow after blow echoed and re- echoed,91117_2.txt
in a way that told plainly that the sledge was,91117_2.txt
being wielded by men who knew how to use,91117_2.txt
it. All this time the guards within the jall,91117_2.txt
"had been keeping very quiet, but now they",91117_2.txt
"could be seen through the windows, running",91117_2.txt
"about, evidently preparing for defense. The",91117_2.txt
first result of this movement became apparent,91117_2.txt
when the light on the porch suddenly went,91117_2.txt
"out, leaving the workers in darkness- the gas",91117_2.txt
had been turned off inside the jail. For a,91117_2.txt
"few moments this caused a lull in the sledging,",91117_2.txt
"but then a candle was produced, and soon a",91117_2.txt
"kerosene lamp, and the banging of the hammer",91117_2.txt
started up again with redoubled vigor,91117_2.txt
amid tremendous yelling by the crowd.,91117_2.txt
The entrance at which this attack was being,91117_2.txt
made is peculiarly strongly situated for,91117_2.txt
defense. It is perhaps ten feet above the,91117_2.txt
"ground, reached by a flight of a dozen steps",91117_2.txt
and a porch not over five feet wide. This,91117_2.txt
gave the attacking party very scant room for,91117_2.txt
"work. The door itself is double, the outer",91117_2.txt
"one being of iron and steel bars, the inner of",91117_2.txt
solid iron. The outer or cage door had of,91117_2.txt
"course to be overcome first, and the sledging,",91117_2.txt
for all it was kept up persistently and with,91117_2.txt
"vigor, had very ilttle effect. The crowd soon",91117_2.txt
"began to be impatient, and ironical shouts of",91117_2.txt
""" Goin' to be all night about that door?"" were",91117_2.txt
"going up on every side, when all at once",91117_2.txt
there was a change. A big brawny miner appeared,91117_2.txt
"on the porch, and he had his miner's",91117_2.txt
pick with him. With a wave of his hand he,91117_2.txt
got the other workers out of the way and,91117_2.txt
struck a scientific blow at the stonework,91117_2.txt
about the hinges. The splinters and chips,91117_2.txt
"flew in every direction, and it was evident in",91117_2.txt
a moment that a very few more such strokes,91117_2.txt
would settle the door. The guards inside evIdently,91117_2.txt
"appreciated this as well as anybody,",91117_2.txt
"for they at once ceased their Fabian tactics,",91117_2.txt
"and, throwing open the solid inside door,",91117_2.txt
turned the fire hose on the lights of the attackers,91117_2.txt
". This caused another delay, while",91117_2.txt
"the illumination was relit, only to be extinguished",91117_2.txt
in the same way once again. The,91117_2.txt
next time the light- holders lit up they put,91117_2.txt
"their hats before the lanips and candles,",91117_2.txt
while others tore off one of the storm doors,91117_2.txt
and pressed it against the grating break,91117_2.txt
the force of the stream from the faces of the,91117_2.txt
"workers, snd then the hammer began again.",91117_2.txt
The struggle continued in this way for,91117_2.txt
time One of the guards inside the jail,91117_2.txt
some.,91117_2.txt
fired on the beslegers and a colored boy was,91117_2.txt
wounded in the hip. This increased rather,91117_2.txt
than diminished the zeal of the mob.,91117_2.txt
Street cars were stopped and the headlights,91117_2.txt
taken off to furnish light for the men at work,91117_2.txt
upon the door.,91117_2.txt
Other parties began work upon the other,91117_2.txt
entrances of the jail. Twenty men took a,91117_2.txt
long four- inch iron pipe some one found and,91117_2.txt
using it as a battering- ram made short work,91117_2.txt
of the ground floor door on South eleventh,91117_2.txt
street. As it went in a perfect roar of satisfaction,91117_2.txt
"went up from 10,000 throats:"" They're",91117_2.txt
"in! They're in! Come on, everybody!"" was",91117_2.txt
"the cry, and hundreds of men crowded themselves",91117_2.txt
"into the corridor, where everybody",91117_2.txt
soon found himself in everybody else's way,91117_2.txt
for there were several to,91117_2.txt
broken down before they could even get up-,91117_2.txt
", but nothing daunted, the battering-",91117_2.txt
"stairs ram men fell to work with a will, and the",91117_2.txt
crash of their blows re- echoed through the,91117_2.txt
building. To intimidate this party the,91117_2.txt
whole,91117_2.txt
"guards fired several more shots from shotguns,",91117_2.txt
which made a most thunderous and disquieting,91117_2.txt
"noise, but the fact announced by some",91117_2.txt
body that the charges were only blank,91117_2.txt
markedly spoiled the effect.,91117_2.txt
"Finally at 10:30, by dint of hard work with",91117_2.txt
"the crows, the sledge and the miners' picks,",91117_2.txt
the outside grated door on the north side,91117_2.txt
gave way and was torn aside. Five minutes,91117_2.txt
"more and the inner door yielded, and with a",91117_2.txt
rush the mob went into the jall.,91117_2.txt
They expected a hot reception as they went,91117_2.txt
up the stairs. They were confronted by a,91117_2.txt
"squad of policemen, but still they poured up",91117_2.txt
the stairs. The officers saw it was no use;,91117_2.txt

"procedure in Pennsylvania and in the darkest South in these lynching cases,",91137_0.txt
even to the subtle manufacture of false press reports. The white man commits,91137_0.txt
a thousand crimes to avenge one crime of a Negro. And he is so unashamed,91137_0.txt
that he ravenously gathers souvenirs of his own atrocities and,91137_0.txt
exhibits them with glee and gloating.,91137_0.txt

the most notorious confession of criminal complicity ever made by a high,91138_0.txt
civil officer. The remark that he would have resigned his office is wholly,91138_0.txt
boastful and superfluous. He has done greater crime as Governor than he,91138_0.txt
could ever do as the leader of a hundred mobs. There is talk of his impeachment,91138_0.txt

"citement of the moment, it is natural",91145_0.txt
that the victim should say,91145_0.txt

When the Mormons settled in Missouri in,91174_0.txt

to be present.,91174_0.txt
A strong violent mob of lynchers was about,91174_0.txt

the most desperately dangerous men that Missou-,91174_0.txt

"Some of the Mormons were tared and feathered,",91174_0.txt
"some were scourged with long, knotty hickories,",91174_0.txt
till they fainted from the excess of torture and,91174_0.txt
the loss of blood- others were forcibly deprived,91174_0.txt
"of their property, and reduced in a day to the",91174_0.txt
condition of beggars- while others still shared,91174_0.txt
a doom of more mercy and were shot down on,91174_0.txt
the prairie like so many wolves. At last Turk,91174_0.txt
resolved to take some of the conceit out of the,91174_0.txt
"young preacher, Mills, and he gave notice to his",91174_0.txt

"It was a dreadful cold night in mid- winter,",91174_0.txt
"1833, and although the sky was cloudless, and",91174_0.txt

"flaming like a meteor in their imaginations, or",91174_0.txt
they never could have ventured to face such an,91174_0.txt
ice blast as that. The congregation included,91174_0.txt
"men and women in about equal numbers, and",91174_0.txt
"many of the former carried rifles, which they",91174_0.txt
"grasped with one hand, even when kneeling down",91174_0.txt

"either real or imagined, as they deemed pending",91174_0.txt

The preacher- the enthusiastic Mills- had,91174_0.txt
advanced to a thrilling head of his eloquent discourse,91174_0.txt
", and was painting in terrible fire- language",91174_0.txt
the bitter persecution which has ever followed,91174_0.txt
the footsteps of all great reformers since the,91174_0.txt
beginning of time. Never before had he been,91174_0.txt
half so animated or half so affecting. His blue,91174_0.txt
eye gleamed like a star- his voice pealed like a,91174_0.txt
"trumpet, shrill as the wild wind which whistled",91174_0.txt
over the house top; and his beardless lip seemed,91174_0.txt
"literally loaded with music. Groans, tears,",91174_0.txt
"and wild shrieks from the audience, proved the",91174_0.txt

No person can depict the scene of dismay and,91174_0.txt

"aloud, as if all hope had departed. Several of",91174_0.txt

"building, and the muzzles of fifty cocked guns",91174_0.txt
and pistols were thrust in through the doors and,91174_0.txt
windows. Still none within lifted a finger for,91174_0.txt

of mercy as to the age or sex. The,91174_0.txt
cries and vain entreaties of the poor sufferers,91174_0.txt

Up to this time young Mills had continued,91174_0.txt
standing with the Bible of their prophet in,91174_0.txt
"hand, but unearthly pale and strangely excited his,",91174_0.txt
"his lip writhing, his teeth clenched, and his",91174_0.txt
bright eyes swimming in a halo of fire. Suddenly,91174_0.txt
"he made a bound for an adjacent window,",91174_0.txt
and notwithstanding more than twenty endeavored,91174_0.txt
"to seize he, he effected his escape from",91174_0.txt

The flight of Mills was directed in a straight,91174_0.txt

pocket for the last few days to be ready for any,91174_0.txt

The skates were produced; the eager Colonel,91174_0.txt

"knew at a glance what it meant. The mob, to",91174_0.txt
"prevent any of the Mormons from escaping, had",91174_0.txt
stationed a guard beyond the river. He instantly,91174_0.txt
"turned his course down the stream, when a",91174_0.txt
"whole platoon let off their rifles, but the distance",91174_0.txt
was too considerable. A hail of bullets,91174_0.txt
rattled around him on the ice without injury.,91174_0.txt
""" I will foil the fiends yet,"" he said to himself,",91174_0.txt
"and put forth all his speed. Mills flew away,",91174_0.txt

some one was,91174_0.txt

"the officers, the mob then dispersed into groups, but continued",91198_0.txt
to denounce the gamblers in the most exciting language,91198_0.txt
. For the purpose of greater safety the prisoner,91198_0.txt
was now smuggled into a carriage and hurried away to the,91198_0.txt

The mob followed. The prisoner appeared with a revolver,91198_0.txt
"in each hand, and guarded by many officers, who at",91198_0.txt
length succeeded in locking him up. In a few minutes an,91198_0.txt

serve. In the meantime it was announced that people,91198_0.txt
from the interior of the State promised to send aid to the,91198_0.txt
committee. The authorities procured cannon to defend,91198_0.txt

Subsequently the committee returned and demanded that,91198_0.txt
"Cora, the murderer of Richardson, should be delivered to",91198_0.txt
"them. The Sheriff at first refused compliance, but as the",91198_0.txt

LYNCH LAW IN TEXAS.,91223_0.txt
Whenever the Court of Judge Lynch organizes and,91223_0.txt
"gets fairly at work, it is a most difficult matter to",91223_0.txt
"prevent its being prorogued indefinitely, and extending",91223_0.txt
its labors far beyond even what is claimed as the,91223_0.txt
limits of its legitimate jurisdiction. The history of,91223_0.txt
Lynch law in Texas presents a case in point. We,91223_0.txt
"remember the time, years ago, when Texas was what",91223_0.txt
"California became afterwards, a refuge and asylum",91223_0.txt
"for law- breakers, fugitives from justice and outcasts",91223_0.txt
"from society generally. Now it is anything but that,",91223_0.txt
and criminals fleeing from lawful punishment would,91223_0.txt
"do well to avoid the Lone Star State, or at least beware",91223_0.txt
that the story of their misdeeds does not follow,91223_0.txt
"them, and, of all things, refrain from any natural impulse",91223_0.txt
towards a repetition of their offenses while enjoying,91223_0.txt
"the hospitality of the home of their adoption,",91223_0.txt
lest that hospitality should leave them at a ten minutes,91223_0.txt
' warning dangling by the neck to the limb of,91223_0.txt
"the nearest tree. Indeed, should Judge Lynch continue",91223_0.txt
to supersede Blackstone at the progressive,91223_0.txt
"rate of the past few years, it will soon not be safe for",91223_0.txt
a stranger to travel through certain parts of Texas,91223_0.txt
"on horse, mule or mustang, without the most convincing",91223_0.txt
and undeniable credentials in his pocket.,91223_0.txt
So common has it become' in the portions of that,91223_0.txt
State where the jurisdiction of Judge Lynch is acknowledged,91223_0.txt
", to yield unquestioning obedience to his",91223_0.txt
"behests, that the execution of his sentences is generally",91223_0.txt
treated lightly and made the occasion of numerous,91223_0.txt
good humored remarks. A joke follows the,91223_0.txt
operation of stringing a horse thief up between heaven,91223_0.txt
"and earth quite appropriately, gracefully and naturally",91223_0.txt
". We recollect that not long"" since a friend, of",91223_0.txt
"large experience in the Lone Star State, related to us",91223_0.txt

"dozen Mexicans, who proved themselves famous fellows",91223_0.txt
"at the game of appropriating stray horses, mules,",91223_0.txt
and in fact almost any kind of property that in law,91223_0.txt
would be presumed to belong to somebody else.,91223_0.txt
"Their acquisitive career, however, was suddenly closed",91223_0.txt
by a misfortune which was to them probably quite as,91223_0.txt
unexpected as extraordinary. Early one morning,91223_0.txt
the dead bodies of the whole band were found suspended,91223_0.txt
"by the necks to the limbs of a"" black- jack""",91223_0.txt
"tree, and it was supposed, gravely continued the narrator",91223_0.txt
", that they had hanged themselves through remorse",91223_0.txt
"for their misdeeds, or from a feeling of shame",91223_0.txt
and mortification at having selected a bad lot of,91223_0.txt
horses. Society could hardly lose anything by the,91223_0.txt
"death of these rascals, but we think that the people",91223_0.txt
of that neighborhood might quite reasonably have regretted,91223_0.txt
that they did not choose some other locality,91223_0.txt

"all the names, rather than die, but really knew but",91223_0.txt
"few of the men, and only answered as I did from fear",91223_0.txt

"The Leavenworth Times, of September 18th,",91255_0.txt
comes to us with a long account of an attempt at,91255_0.txt

swelling sensation among the auditors There,91255_0.txt
. is,91255_0.txt
a rush towards the door of the court room. The,91255_0.txt
prisoner moves from his criminal seat to one beside,91255_0.txt
"his counsel; his face, before marked with",91255_0.txt
"calmness, now becomes flushed with emotion; turns",91255_0.txt
pale; now crimsoned; gazes upon the door with,91255_0.txt
"uneasiness; turns towards the Court, and manifests",91255_0.txt
the feeling of a man who has passed one trying,91255_0.txt
ordeal to undertake another and more severe one.,91255_0.txt
Some time before Gordon was discharged rumors,91255_0.txt
flew about the streets that he would soon be,91255_0.txt
acquitted. Crowds rushed to the Courthouse to,91255_0.txt
"ascertain the facts, some out of curiosity, others",91255_0.txt
breathing vengeance. The rumor proved true,91255_0.txt
"The news spread like wild fire over the city, and",91255_0.txt
the crowd augmented.,91255_0.txt
The prisoner was now free to go wherever he,91255_0.txt
"pleased, but dare not leave the court room for fear",91255_0.txt
of the angry crowd without. It was now apparent,91255_0.txt
that an attempt would be made to lynch him.,91255_0.txt
At this time the excitement was so intense that,91255_0.txt
clearly there was no other way to save Gordon's,91255_0.txt
life except by taking him to the county jail.,91255_0.txt
Accordingly he placed himself under charge of,91255_0.txt

had just commenced. The crowd increased round,91255_0.txt

"armed with muskets, knives and revolvers, gathered",91255_0.txt
"thick and fast, and as the shades of night came",91255_0.txt
"on, large bonfires were built up all around the jail,",91255_0.txt
throwing their lurid light far out over the city;,91255_0.txt

made it a scene terribly vivid and fearful.,91255_0.txt
"During all this time, Mayor McDowell made",91255_0.txt
"several speeches, urging obedience to the law, and",91255_0.txt
requesting the people to return home in quiet.-,91255_0.txt
That he was determined to enforce the law at all,91255_0.txt
hazards. It was finally agreed between the Mayor,91255_0.txt
and the ring- leaders of the riot that Gordon should,91255_0.txt
"be delivered over to Sheriff Middaugh, and that",91255_0.txt
all further disorder and riotous proceedings should,91255_0.txt

". The crowd rushed upon Gordon, crying like",91255_0.txt
"demons,"" Hang him! hang him!"" They forced",91255_0.txt
him down into the narrow and rocky glen north of,91255_0.txt
"the jail. It was then about 8 o'clock at night,",91255_0.txt
and a thick darkness had settled upon the whole,91255_0.txt
"city, and this fierce crowd raged in the dark glen",91255_0.txt
like demons. It was terrible. But the brave officers,91255_0.txt
"stood by the prisoner like gallant men, and",91255_0.txt
"sometimes almost overborne, they still recovered",91255_0.txt
and pressed forward holding Gordon safe in their,91255_0.txt
charge. Several times the crowd had a halter,91255_0.txt
"around his neck, but each time an officer cut the",91255_0.txt
"rope, and thus they struggled up out of the ravine,",91255_0.txt
and then followed a tumult and strife between the,91255_0.txt
officers and rioters that was desperate to the last,91255_0.txt
"degree, up Fourth street to Shawnee, and down",91255_0.txt
Shawnee to the Planters' House. Here the crowd,91255_0.txt
"halted, and the contest for half an hour was fierce",91255_0.txt
"and terrific. The din, howl and confusion was",91255_0.txt
"now worse than pandemonium, the prisoner begging",91255_0.txt
"to be hung, killed or anything to take him",91255_0.txt
out of such agony. By this time every stitch of,91255_0.txt
clothing was torn off him.,91255_0.txt

of people sacked dwellings anticipated further attacks,91273_0.txt
. In the principal streets the shutters were kept,91273_0.txt

up to suddenly close them in case of danger.,91273_0.txt

was but an effort to restore order till regiments should,91273_0.txt

At five o'clock Colonel Sherwood's battery of rifled 6-,91273_0.txt
"pounders and a strong force of infantry, under command",91273_0.txt
"of Col. Meyer, were ordered to the corner of 27th",91273_0.txt
street and Seventh Avenue to quell a serious disturbance,91273_0.txt
which had broken out at that point. On arriving there,91273_0.txt
they found the people busily engaged in rifling and gutting,91273_0.txt
the stores and private houses. Flames were issuing,91273_0.txt
"from the widows, and the scene resembled closely many",91273_0.txt
similar ones which our citizens during the last few days,91273_0.txt
have been called to look on. Suspended from a lamppost,91273_0.txt
"was the body of a black man, who had been hung",91273_0.txt
up a few minutes before. The firemen made their appearance,91273_0.txt
on the ground at the same time as the military.,91273_0.txt
The people who had been engaged in the work of destruction,91273_0.txt
"retired behind the firemen, thus placing a barrier",91273_0.txt
of our brave firemen between themselves and the,91273_0.txt
military. It was this circumstance only which prevented,91273_0.txt
the d'scharge of the ifled field pieces. From the,91273_0.txt
housetops the usual salute of brickbats and stones,91273_0.txt
was showered down on the military. Several citizens,91273_0.txt
stepped up to Col. Meyer and informed him that men,91273_0.txt
were stationed on the housetops with rifles in their hands,91273_0.txt
ready to fire on his men. The Colonel thereupon order-,91273_0.txt
"ed his men to keep a sharp lookout, and if any shots",91273_0.txt
were fired from the housetops to deliver a volley instantly,91273_0.txt
. At this time Judge McCunn appeared on the,91273_0.txt
"scene, and entreated the Colonel"" to spare those inno-",91273_0.txt
"cent people."" The Judge informed the Colonel that he",91273_0.txt
"had, by authority from Gov. Seymour, been using his",91273_0.txt
influence to quell the disturbance. Colonel Meyer replied,91273_0.txt
"that he, as a military man, had but to obey orders,",91273_0.txt
and if the people attempted to advance or fire on his,91273_0.txt
men he should certainly ordered it to be returned by a,91273_0.txt

in getting his prisoners to the Basin.,91506_0.txt
It was reported to Sheriff Fenton,91506_0.txt
last Wednesday morning that a mob,91506_0.txt
was coming up to Basin from Hiatts-,91506_0.txt
ville and Tonslip to lynch Gorman and,91506_0.txt
"Walters, and the sheriff took these two",91506_0.txt

Gorman managed to slip his handcuffs,91506_0.txt
and make his escape. He swam,91506_0.txt

feat) and made for the mountains. A,91506_0.txt
"posse was quickly organized, and Gor",91506_0.txt
man was recaptured about fifty miles,91506_0.txt
from Basin.,91506_0.txt
Last night a mob of about fifty unmasked,91506_0.txt
men rode up the east bank of,91506_0.txt
the Big Horn and compelled the ferryman,91506_0.txt
to carry them across the river.,91506_0.txt
They made no demonstration until,91506_0.txt
"they entered Basin, when five shots",91506_0.txt
were fired as a warning. The mob proceeded,91506_0.txt
at once to the county jail and,91506_0.txt
fired a volley into the jail.,91506_0.txt
Deputy Pierce and Special Deputy,91506_0.txt
Meade were guarding the prisoners at,91506_0.txt
the time. One bullet grazed Meade's,91506_0.txt

and whose names have been,91506_0.txt
withheld owing to threats made against,91506_0.txt
the sheriff. Sheriff Fenton is unable to,91506_0.txt
get his prisoners to Basin. It is said,91506_0.txt
the same mob that lynched Gorman,91506_0.txt
and Walters are sympathizers and have,91506_0.txt
declared that Sheriff Fenton will never,91506_0.txt
get out of the locality alive with his,91506_0.txt
prisoners.,91506_0.txt
Sheriff Fenton has wired the governor,91506_0.txt
of Wyoming for permission to use,91506_0.txt
the state militia at Lander and has also,91506_0.txt
sent a telephone message to Basin and,91506_0.txt
other towns asking for volunteers to,91506_0.txt

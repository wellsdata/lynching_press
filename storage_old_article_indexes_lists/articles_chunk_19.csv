LOUISIANA BARBARISM.,89628_2.txt
A Washington dispatch says the State Department,89628_2.txt
has received from the Italian authorities,89628_2.txt
a copy of the complete report made,89628_2.txt
"by the Marquis Romono, secretary of the",89628_2.txt
"embassy at Washington, on his personal investigation",89628_2.txt
of the recent lynching of five,89628_2.txt
"Italians at Tallulah, La. The secretary was",89628_2.txt
sent to Louisiana to investigate the matter.,89628_2.txt
and his report embodies the Italian side of,89628_2.txt
the case. It was easy to see from the beginning,89628_2.txt
that the affair would become an,89628_2.txt
international one. The chances are that,89628_2.txt
"some, if not all, of the victims of the mob",89628_2.txt
"were Italian subjects, and we have learned",89628_2.txt
by experience that the Italian government,89628_2.txt
does not overlook such cases. In its main,89628_2.txt
features the present one closely resembles,89628_2.txt
"that of 1891, when several Italians were",89628_2.txt
"lynched by a mob at New Orleans, and",89628_2.txt
which ended by the United States paying,89628_2.txt
"$ 25,000 indemnity to the families of the victims",89628_2.txt
". The Italian government, in a spirit",89628_2.txt
"of friendliness, accepted the indemnity as",89628_2.txt
"sufficient reparation,"" without prejudice to",89628_2.txt
actions at law which may be brought by the,89628_2.txt
"aggrieved parties.""",89628_2.txt
The present case grew out of race hatred,89628_2.txt
almost as distinctly as if the murdered. Ital-,89628_2.txt
ians had been negroes. It was their dark,89628_2.txt
complexion and the association with negroes,89628_2.txt
that led to their being lynched for complicity,89628_2.txt
in an affray in which a white man,89628_2.txt
was hurt. To understand the case one must,89628_2.txt
know something of the community where it,89628_2.txt
"occurred. Mr. Norman Walker, chief edit-",89628_2.txt
writer of the Times- Democrat newspaper,89628_2.txt
"orial, of New Orleans, says in an article in",89628_2.txt

lans by Dr. Hodges. The first attack came,89628_3.txt
"from one of the Italians, but it was not a",89628_3.txt
"murderous attack, as the man had no weapon",89628_3.txt
. Dr. Hodges had a pistol and used it in,89628_3.txt
"self- defense, as he had a right to do, first",89628_3.txt
beating his assailant on the head with the,89628_3.txt
butt of it and then returning a shot that,89628_3.txt
was fired at him. The shooting drew a,89628_3.txt
crowd and the mob did the rest. The first,89628_3.txt

"and, accordingly, in causes arising between",89628_3.txt
whites and negroes the most summary,89628_3.txt
method is resorted to rather than the ordinary,89628_3.txt
slow processes of the law. When a,89628_3.txt
planter was killed by a negro in 1894 nine,89628_3.txt
"negroes were lynched for it, and but a short",89628_3.txt
time ago a negro was lynched for shooting,89628_3.txt
at a white man. The Tallulah affair has,89628_3.txt
brought out the fact that there have been,89628_3.txt
several recent lynchings in Madison which,89628_3.txt
the papers did not report- one only two,89628_3.txt
months ago at Omega. When the Italians,89628_3.txt

them was a difficult preblem. It has finally,89628_3.txt

awarded to a negro in Madison who assaults,89628_3.txt

not a trial.,89628_3.txt
This is the key to the whole affair. The,89628_3.txt
"lynching occurred on the 20th of July last,",89628_3.txt
and the first account of it represented that,89628_3.txt
the Italians had conspired to murder one,89628_3.txt

the Italians grew out of a quarrel over and the,89628_3.txt
It is quite likely that the information on,89628_4.txt
which the sheriff of Miami county appealed,89628_4.txt
to the Governor for military ald to prevent,89628_4.txt
"a lynching was unreliable, but his appeal",89628_4.txt

Mr.,89634_0.txt
with great earnestness of purpose.,89634_0.txt
Graham had large audiences at both the,89634_0.txt
morning and evening services. For his,89634_0.txt
"morning discourse he took the text,"" Do",89634_0.txt
"justice to the afflicted and needy,"" and",89634_0.txt
"said, in part:",89634_0.txt
""" The American negro is afflicted and the",89634_0.txt
cause of his affliction is a most unreasonable,89634_0.txt
and silly prejudice in the white Amer-,89634_0.txt

"seem more reasonable, since the Caucasian",89634_0.txt
"has suffered nothing from the negro, while",89634_0.txt
the latter has suffered everything at the,89634_0.txt
hands of the Caucasian. While this prejudice,89634_0.txt
"is greatest in the South, it also manifests",89634_0.txt
itself greatly to the affliction of the,89634_0.txt
colored man in the North. When he wants,89634_0.txt
to buy property or rent a house he is often,89634_0.txt
turned away because of his color. When he,89634_0.txt
seeks employment where help is advertised,89634_0.txt

apply. Our girls cannot get employment,89634_0.txt
"in shops, stores or factories, no matter how",89634_0.txt
"well educated, refined and good- looking.",89634_0.txt

"of youths who, with a man's chance, would",89634_0.txt
have become honorable and industrious citizens,89634_0.txt

LAST NIGHT BY A MEXICAN,89721_0.txt
EMIL LINDTHEL FATALLY STABBED,89721_0.txt
A few minutes after 11 o'clock last,89721_0.txt
night Emil Linthel yesterday stabbed,89721_0.txt
in the rear of H. Kreismer's barber,89721_0.txt
shop on Brewery avenue. The deed,89721_0.txt
was committed by a Mexican who is,89721_0.txt
now in jail.,89721_0.txt
The first warning that a tragedy had,89721_0.txt
been committed was a loud outery by,89721_0.txt
Linthel that he had been stabbed. He,89721_0.txt
yelled for those near to catch a Mexi-,89721_0.txt
can claiming that he had done the,89721_0.txt
deed.,89721_0.txt
Several bystanders rushed from in,89721_0.txt
"front of the Brewery saloon, and Jack",89721_0.txt
Wikstrom caught the Mexican pointed,89721_0.txt
out by the wounded man. Friends,89721_0.txt
"rushed to Linthel's assistance, and he",89721_0.txt
was taken inside the saloon.,89721_0.txt
The Mexican was taken before him,89721_0.txt
and Lindthel stated positively that he,89721_0.txt
was the man who had made the fatal,89721_0.txt
thrust. Several other Mexicans were,89721_0.txt
"searched, but allowed to go. Officer",89721_0.txt
Overlock placed the Mexican under arrest,89721_0.txt
and he was taken at once to the,89721_0.txt
city jail.,89721_0.txt
The wounded man was taken to a,89721_0.txt
booth in the rear of the saloon and,89721_0.txt
"laid on the floor. He was able to talk,",89721_0.txt
but as soon as his clothes were torn,89721_0.txt
from his breast it was seen that a,89721_0.txt
knife thrust had been made on the,89721_0.txt
left side just below the collar bone.,89721_0.txt
In a few moments his breast and,89721_0.txt
"clothes were saturated with blood, and",89721_0.txt
the gradually grew weaker. Lindthel,89721_0.txt
"made a request to be turned on his,",89721_0.txt
"side, and when this was done blood",89721_0.txt
began to flow from his mouth.,89721_0.txt
In a few moments the man was,89721_0.txt
dead. Dr. Edmondson came as soon as,89721_0.txt
"he be summoned, but arrived",89721_0.txt
too could late to be of any service. He stated,89721_0.txt
that the knife had severed one of the,89721_0.txt
"arteries leading to the heart, and that",89721_0.txt
death was caused by inward bleeding.,89721_0.txt
As soon as Linthel was dead Justice,89721_0.txt
Williams arrived and summoned the,89721_0.txt
following jury to serve at the inquest:,89721_0.txt
John,89721_0.txt
"W. J. Nemick, W. P. Jones,",89721_0.txt
"Brannon, A. T. Weaver, Wm. Beck,",89721_0.txt
and Wm. Horn. They viewed the remains,89721_0.txt
", and will meet this morning to",89721_0.txt
arrive at a verdict.,89721_0.txt
Then began a search for the knife,89721_0.txt
with which the crime had been committed,89721_0.txt
. A drop of blood was found on,89721_0.txt
a board near the steps leading up to,89721_0.txt
the porch of the Dubacher building at,89721_0.txt
the north end.,89721_0.txt
The blood lead to the Brewery saloon,89721_0.txt
". The alley and boxes, or any",89721_0.txt
place in which a knife might be secreted,89721_0.txt
", were carefully searched. After",89721_0.txt
half an hour's careful scrutiny of the,89721_0.txt
surroundings. Office. Howe found the,89721_0.txt
knife just under the corral fence east,89721_0.txt
of E. G. Ord's plumbing house.,89721_0.txt
It was an ordinary butcher knife,89721_0.txt
that had been carefully worked down,89721_0.txt
"to a thin sharp blade, and was covered",89721_0.txt
from point to hilt with blood. It was,89721_0.txt
found about ten yards from where the,89721_0.txt
tragedy occurred.,89721_0.txt
Shortly the Mexican arrested,89721_0.txt
was taken after to jail an officer went to,89721_0.txt
his cell ande xamined his hands. He,89721_0.txt
one of them covered with blood,89721_0.txt
that was hardly yet dry.,89721_0.txt
About this time threats were made,89721_0.txt
"of lynching, and had any one volunteered",89721_0.txt
"to act as a leader, the crowd",89721_0.txt
"would have gone to the jail, taken",89721_0.txt
out the Mexican and strung him up to,89721_0.txt
nearest pole. For an hour lynch,89721_0.txt
"the talk was kept up, but about 1 o'clock",89721_0.txt
this morning it had subsided.,89721_0.txt
At one time there was a large,89721_0.txt
gathered around a Mexican throught crowd,89721_0.txt
to have been with the alleged murderer,89721_0.txt
. He was carefully searched for,89721_0.txt
"weapons, and some wanted to take",89721_0.txt
him out and lynch him for being in,89721_0.txt
all probability an accomplice.,89721_0.txt
Numerous theories are advanced as,89721_0.txt
to what might have caused the stabbing,89721_0.txt
. One is that Lindthel refused,89721_0.txt
"the Mexican a glass of beer, and that",89721_0.txt
"the latter swore revenge, which he",89721_0.txt
took in a bloody manner.,89721_0.txt

tragedy came up yesterday from Cana-,89721_0.txt

days working in a barber shop. They,89721_0.txt
"may have had trouble there, though no",89721_0.txt
one here last night was able to throw,89721_0.txt
any light on the affair.,89721_0.txt
Lindthel came to this city about the,89721_0.txt
"months ago from Bakersfield, Calif.,",89721_0.txt
and was employed in the barber shop,89721_0.txt
owned,89721_0.txt
"on Brewery avenue, by H.",89721_0.txt
Kreimer. He quit a short time ago,89721_0.txt
Lindthel came to this city about three,89721_0.txt
city yesterday.,89721_0.txt
This morning the dead man was to,89721_0.txt
"go to Tucson, where he had a position",89721_0.txt
in one of the barber shops there waiting,89721_0.txt
for him. He was around town before,89721_0.txt
"the stabbing, and was seen in",89721_0.txt
"several of the saloons, though did not",89721_0.txt
drink heavily.,89721_0.txt
The deceased is about thirty- years of,89721_0.txt
"age, and was considered a good workman",89721_0.txt
at his trade. He weighed about,89721_0.txt
"170 pounds, was light complexioned,",89721_0.txt
and wore a mustache. He was of German,89721_0.txt

"refused, and the members of the family were",89773_0.txt

seemed to understand just where to go.,89773_0.txt
"They entered the upper room of the jail,",89773_0.txt
lighted a lamp in the corridor and placed,89773_0.txt
guards on the outside of the cell in which,89773_0.txt
Tyler and an old man were confined. The,89773_0.txt
cell door was unlocked and two members of,89773_0.txt

two hundred yards away.,89773_0.txt

mob selected a convenient limb on a shade,89773_0.txt
"tree, and over this the end of the rope was",89773_0.txt
thrown. Tyler was placed on an old door,89773_0.txt
and held up while the end of the rope was,89773_0.txt

", but he could find no trace of the",89773_0.txt
lynchers. From whence they came or where,89773_0.txt
they went is a mystery. Besides the sheriff's,89773_0.txt
family and the old man who occupied the,89773_0.txt
"cell with Tyler, only one man has been",89773_0.txt
found who saw them. This was a young,89773_0.txt
man who returned from the country with a,89773_0.txt
horse which he put in a livery stable. On,89773_0.txt
coming from the stable to go to nis hotel,89773_0.txt
he was halted by three men with drawn,89773_0.txt
revolvers. He was ordered to sit down in,89773_0.txt

He remained across the street from the jail.,89773_0.txt
He says those who went into the jail wore,89773_0.txt
"long dark masks, but the men who guarded",89773_0.txt
him wore no masks that he could discern.,89773_0.txt
After the mob left the courtyard this young,89773_0.txt
man was ordered to go into the stable and,89773_0.txt
remain there half an hour under penalty of,89773_0.txt
"being shot. He went into the stable, but",89773_0.txt
came out as Sheriff Gobin was passing. The,89773_0.txt
"coroner was at once notified, and shortly",89773_0.txt

The South in general and Kentucky,89892_0.txt

Governor Morrow's firmly courageous,89892_0.txt
action. In using the militia to disperse,89892_0.txt

"NEW YORK, Dec. 17.- What, in",89893_0.txt
"your opinion, should be the lowest",89893_0.txt
age at which a Negro could be lynched,89893_0.txt
without destroying our best traditions,89893_0.txt
?,89893_0.txt
"Georgia, always in the van for innovation",89893_0.txt
", has just completed, with its",89893_0.txt
"usual taste for finish, the dispatch of",89893_0.txt
a nine- year- old. The boy was hauled,89893_0.txt
through the streets by a rope and then,89893_0.txt
carefully and chivalrously shot.,89893_0.txt
Now this gives rise to several questions,89893_0.txt
"in the matter of lynching, and",89893_0.txt
we feel that the art can take its place,89893_0.txt
"with other purely American customs,",89893_0.txt
"which, so we understand, is the envy",89893_0.txt
of the whole European continent and,89893_0.txt
has already taken its immortal niche,89893_0.txt
in Madame Tussaud's Waxworks.,89893_0.txt
Our third- degree system has been,89893_0.txt
brought to a perfect state. We know,89893_0.txt
that our police force can be depended,89893_0.txt
upon to deliver the goods and our,89893_0.txt
American pride is satisfied with that,89893_0.txt
department of democracy. But in our,89893_0.txt
lynchings we still seem to be groping,89893_0.txt
around in haphazard fashion. One,89893_0.txt
"state, for instance, will take up the",89893_0.txt
"fashion of burning a Negro in oil,",89893_0.txt
another will merely hang him and,89893_0.txt
"then, when the rope seems about",89893_0.txt
"ready to stifle his breath, shoot him",89893_0.txt
in order to end his sufferings. This,89893_0.txt
"is a compromise, we feel, with the",89893_0.txt
original spirit of our national conscience,89893_0.txt
". Again, other parts of the",89893_0.txt
republic have seen fit to declare holidays,89893_0.txt
when the lynchings were larger,89893_0.txt
than ordinary and women as well as,89893_0.txt
men were scheduled to furnish the,89893_0.txt
amusement.,89893_0.txt
"The latter plan, it seems to us, approaches",89893_0.txt
"nearer, in a spiritual way.",89893_0.txt
to the best things in lynchings. But,89893_0.txt
"there is a drawback even to this, for",89893_0.txt
"in the states where it has been done,",89893_0.txt
while thousands were given the,89893_0.txt
"chance to enjoy the spectacle, the",89893_0.txt
"children could not be present, as the",89893_0.txt

We believe the proper way to lynch,89893_0.txt
"a child, assuming that the Georgian",89893_0.txt

[ Richmond Telegram.],90012_2.txt
There really seems to be not any justification,90012_2.txt

and there was no occasion to doubt that,90012_2.txt
full justice under the law would be meted out,90012_2.txt
to him. This section of the state has been disgraced,90012_2.txt

A Forcible Suggestion.,90012_6.txt
[ Springfield( Mass.) Republican.],90012_6.txt
The Savannah( Ga.) News has made a sensible,90012_6.txt
suggestion anent lynchings in the South.,90012_6.txt
It thinks if they are to be continued they,90012_6.txt
"would better be legalized at once, all laws forbidding",90012_6.txt
them repealed and formal statutory,90012_6.txt
permission given to any crowd of leading citizens,90012_6.txt
"anywhere to hang anybody who, in their",90012_6.txt
"opinion, no matter how hastily formed, deserve",90012_6.txt
hanging.,90012_6.txt
It will be practically impossible for any defender,90012_6.txt
of lynch law to answer the suggestion.,90012_6.txt
The argument behind it is convincing. If it be,90012_6.txt
true that public sentiment in the South approves,90012_6.txt
"the lynching of assailants of women, it",90012_6.txt
is absurd to have laws on statute books for,90012_6.txt
bidding it. Such laws are openly and defiantly,90012_6.txt
disobeyed and treated with contempt by the,90012_6.txt
officers of the state who are sworn to execute,90012_6.txt
them. It is only a ridiculous farce to keep,90012_6.txt
them on the statute books. It is more than,90012_6.txt
"this, for their open defiance brings all law into",90012_6.txt
disrespect and encourages the belief that any,90012_6.txt
law can be violated with impunity. These,90012_6.txt
southern newspapers which defend and justify,90012_6.txt
"lynch law should be consistent,",90012_6.txt
If lynching is justifiable under any circumstances,90012_6.txt
"or for and offense, it is unjust and unfair",90012_6.txt
that the laws should directly or impliedly,90012_6.txt
forbid it. There is no escaping this conclusion,90012_6.txt
". If, on the other hand, lynching is a",90012_6.txt
"erime, by whomsover done under whatsoever",90012_6.txt
circumstances; or if it be a crime under any circumstances,90012_6.txt
", the laws against murder and manslaughter",90012_6.txt
properly apply to it and should,90012_6.txt
be enforeed against it. In such case no self-,90012_6.txt
respecting leader of public opinion has any,90012_6.txt
right to do anything but condemn it in season,90012_6.txt
and out of season. There is no escaping this,90012_6.txt
alternative save by remarkable agility in dodging,90012_6.txt

"against mobs, and asked that when a suspect was",90057_1.txt
caught that he be not notified until the next,90057_1.txt

It would be difficult to equal such a statement for,90057_1.txt
sheer barbarity and demagogism. It is a deliberate,90057_1.txt
invitation to the people of South Carolina by an,90057_1.txt

"Lynchings, once common throughout the south,",90058_0.txt
have been decreasing steadily in number during recent,90058_0.txt
years. Not more than ten or twelve persons met,90058_0.txt

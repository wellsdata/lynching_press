to die fighting for their lives and pleaded,90174_0.txt
for a weapon with which to defend,90174_0.txt
"themselves, and when they could not",90174_0.txt
find these they sought hiding- places.,90174_0.txt
"Deputies, thinking to deceive the",90174_0.txt
"crowd by a ruse, transferred the nineteen",90174_0.txt
men to the female department and,90174_0.txt
there the miserable Sicilians trembled,90174_0.txt
in terror until the moment when the,90174_0.txt
doors yielded to the angry throng.,90174_0.txt
Captain Davis refused a request to,90174_0.txt
open the prison and the crowd began,90174_0.txt
the work of tearing the doors down. On,90174_0.txt
"Orleans street, there was a heavy",90174_0.txt
"wooden door, which was barred in",90174_0.txt
ticipation of the coming of the mob an-.,90174_0.txt
This door was selected as the best en-,90174_0.txt
trance. Willing hands went to work to,90174_0.txt
force an opening. This did not prove a,90174_0.txt
difficult task to the trembling but determined,90174_0.txt
throng. Soon there was a,90174_0.txt
"crash, the door gave way and in an instant",90174_0.txt
the armed citizens were pouring,90174_0.txt
through the small opening while a,90174_0.txt
mighty shout went up from the multi-,90174_0.txt
tude. The turnkey was overpowered,90174_0.txt
and his keys taken from him.,90174_0.txt
"By that time excitement was intense,",90174_0.txt
none less so when a patrol wagon drove,90174_0.txt
"up with a detachment of police, who",90174_0.txt
were driven away under a fire of mud,90174_0.txt
and stones.,90174_0.txt
When the leaders inside got possession,90174_0.txt
of the keys the doors were easily,90174_0.txt
unlocked. The door of the first cell was,90174_0.txt
opened. A group of trembling prisoners,90174_0.txt
stood inside. They were not the men,90174_0.txt
who were wanted and the crowd burst,90174_0.txt
into the yard.,90174_0.txt
Peering through the bars of a condemned,90174_0.txt
cell was a terror- stricken face,90174_0.txt
who some mistook for Scaffedi. A volley,90174_0.txt
"was fired at the man and he dropped,",90174_0.txt
but none of the shots struck him and it,90174_0.txt
was subsequently found he was not one,90174_0.txt
of the assassins.,90174_0.txt
The inmates of the jail were ready to,90174_0.txt
direct the way to where the men were.,90174_0.txt
"Arriving at the female ward, the door",90174_0.txt
was locked. In a moment a key was,90174_0.txt
produced. Then the leader called for,90174_0.txt
some one who knew the right men. A,90174_0.txt
volunteer responded and the door was,90174_0.txt
"thrown open. The gallery was deserted,",90174_0.txt
but an old woman said the men were,90174_0.txt
up- stairs. The crowd quickly ascended,90174_0.txt
the stairs and as they reached the landing,90174_0.txt
", the assassins fled down at the other",90174_0.txt
end. Half a dozen followed them.,90174_0.txt
Scarcely a word was spoken.,90174_0.txt
When pursued and pursuers reached,90174_0.txt
"the stone courtyard, the former darted",90174_0.txt
toward the Orleans side of the gallery,90174_0.txt
and in fear and trembling they screamed,90174_0.txt
"for mercy, but the avengers were",90174_0.txt
less. Bang! bang! bang! rang out merci- the,90174_0.txt
bullets was poured into the crouching,90174_0.txt
reports of weapons and a deadly rain of,90174_0.txt
figures.,90174_0.txt
"Gerachi, the closest man, was struck",90174_0.txt
in the back of the head and his body,90174_0.txt
pitched forward.,90174_0.txt
"Romero fell on his knees, with his",90174_0.txt
"face in his hands, and in that position",90174_0.txt
was shot to death.,90174_0.txt

under the fire of a half,90174_0.txt
"guns, leaden pellets entering dozen their",90174_0.txt
bodies and heads.,90174_0.txt
When the group of assassins was discovered,90174_0.txt
"on the gallery, Macheca, Scoffedi",90174_0.txt
and old man Marchesi separated from,90174_0.txt
the other six and ran up stairs. Thither,90174_0.txt
"a half dozen men followed, and as the",90174_0.txt
terror- stricken assassins ran into cells,90174_0.txt
they were slain.,90174_0.txt
Joe Macheca had his back turned,90174_0.txt
when shot.,90174_0.txt
"Scoffedi, one of the most villainous of",90174_0.txt
"the murderers, dropped like a log when",90174_0.txt
a bullet hit him in the eye,90174_0.txt
Politz was locked up in. a cell up,90174_0.txt
stairs. The doors were flung open and,90174_0.txt
"one of the avengers, taking aim, shot",90174_0.txt
him through the body. He was not,90174_0.txt
"killed, and, in order to satisfy the people",90174_0.txt
"on the outside, who were crazy to know",90174_0.txt
"what was going on, he was dragged",90174_0.txt
"down stairs. Half carried, half dragged,",90174_0.txt
"he was taken to a corner, a rope was",90174_0.txt
provided and tied around his neck and,90174_0.txt
the people pulled him up to the crossbars,90174_0.txt
". Not satisfied with that, a score of",90174_0.txt
men poured a volley of shots into his,90174_0.txt
body. For several hours the body was,90174_0.txt
left dangling in the air.,90174_0.txt
Just as soon as the bloody work was,90174_0.txt
"done, Mr. Parkerson asked the crowd to",90174_0.txt
"disperse. They consented to do so and,",90174_0.txt
"with a ringing cheer, lifted Parkerson",90174_0.txt
on their shoulders and marched down,90174_0.txt
"the street to the Clay statue, where",90174_0.txt
they dispersed.,90174_0.txt
The fronts of the newspaper offices,90174_0.txt
were blocked by people. There was intense,90174_0.txt
", suppressed excitement, but the",90174_0.txt
action of the citizens was applauded,90174_0.txt
from one end of the city to the other.,90174_0.txt
The atmosphere has been considerably,90174_0.txt
"purged and, though there is a big crowd",90174_0.txt

armed with such blunderbusses as,90174_2.txt
could only have been made and used for,90174_2.txt
the purpose of assassination.,90174_2.txt
The indignation and excitement was,90174_2.txt
such that mob law and lynching were,90174_2.txt
about to be resorted to. The entire,90174_2.txt
community felt that in the endeavor to,90174_2.txt

argued that as the office of sheriff was a,90204_0.txt
constitutional office he could only be removed,90204_0.txt
after a judicial hearing.,90204_0.txt

"cries of"" lynch him,"" and City Attorney",90235_0.txt
Decker mounted the jail and,90235_0.txt
steps,90235_0.txt
made a strong plea in behalf of law,90235_0.txt
and order. This served to temporarily,90235_0.txt
"stay the mob, but did not appease it,",90235_0.txt
and a short time after Decker's speech,90235_0.txt
the mob started in to batter in the,90235_0.txt

to prevent the entrance of the mob,90235_0.txt
"without avail, and within fifteen minutes",90235_0.txt

entrance to the jail and secured the,90235_0.txt

As he was dragged forth City Attorney,90235_0.txt
Decker again interfered and urged,90235_0.txt
that the negro be given a trial and for,90235_0.txt
an hour he spoke and the mob listened,90235_0.txt

rush was made for the spot where the,90235_0.txt

"two blocks from the jail, a rope",90235_0.txt
"fastened around his neck, and after the",90235_0.txt

attempted to pull the negro from the,90235_0.txt
ground.,90235_0.txt
As many more seized the negro and,90235_0.txt
pulled to prevent him from being hanged,90235_0.txt

swung into the air and strangled to,90235_0.txt

"groes, and finally drove every negro",90235_0.txt
from the confines of Joplin. The pelice,90235_0.txt
were powerless. The first act of the,90235_0.txt
mob after hanging the negro was to,90235_0.txt

population resides. In this way,90235_0.txt
the negroes were driven from all parts,90235_0.txt
of the city to the negro section.,90235_0.txt
Then the mob charged down on that,90235_0.txt
"section. Stones were thrown, doors",90235_0.txt
and winodws of negro houses were,90235_0.txt
broken in and finally several houses,90235_0.txt
were fired. The department responded,90235_0.txt
but many of the houses were burned,90235_0.txt
to the ground. The mot made endeavors,90235_0.txt
to prevent the fire department,90235_0.txt
"from extinguishing the flames, and",90235_0.txt
were partially successful. All the officers,90235_0.txt

THE MAFIA,90355_0.txt
It is close to twenty- three years,90355_0.txt
ago that the death knell of the Mafia,90355_0.txt
"in America was sounded, rung by",90355_0.txt
the best citizens of New Orleans in,90355_0.txt
their fury of what they believed was,90355_0.txt
a miscarriage of justice. This organization,90355_0.txt
was originally a political,90355_0.txt
"one in Italy, but in this country it",90355_0.txt
had degenerated into a band of assassins,90355_0.txt
". New Orleans, in a measure,",90355_0.txt
"was its headquarters, and this city",90355_0.txt
found the most difficulty in its suppression,90355_0.txt
", and it was the people and",90355_0.txt
not the law that brought it about.,90355_0.txt
The means to the end of the organization,90355_0.txt
was the murder of Chief,90355_0.txt

the ex- slave and searching into reasons which have been given to,90635_0.txt

"of Florida, Georgia and Alabama hurled the fear of death with great",90635_0.txt
agony and terrible horror into the souls of black folks. The use of,90635_0.txt
the ballot is the inevitable means of political expression for American,90635_0.txt
citizens. This is denied and refused to black people. The denial and,90635_0.txt
refusal is enforced by lynchings or threats which signify the same.,90635_0.txt
The Ku Klux Klan carries its silent and sinister warning and like the,90635_0.txt
"pirate's flag, embellished with skull and bones, its emblems scream",90635_0.txt

to the people across the sea.,90635_0.txt
lynch law has destroyed black men for having wealth and has even,90635_0.txt
been extended to fit the case of those who sought to get it. We,90635_0.txt
know men of our race who have been lynched for having bought,90635_0.txt
comfortable homes. We know others who have been driven from,90635_0.txt
their estates and their possessions seized and confiscated. Openly,90635_0.txt
and notoriously technical slavery and practical peonage is conducted,90635_0.txt
in the south with impunity. The labor of the black man has been,90635_0.txt
made profitable not for himself but for the lynch lords. It was the,90635_0.txt
lynch law which kept many of us from leaving the south and securing,90635_0.txt

still denied free ingress and egress between the separate states. The,90635_0.txt

that confronts the black man of America is the unmitigated outlawry,90635_0.txt
"of certain citizens living to a large extent in the south. For emphasis,",90635_0.txt

that is that the lynch law is the Nemesis and barrier in the pathway,90635_0.txt

thinking men of the white race is beginning to realize that the lynching,90636_1.txt
evil and kindred crimes are developing the most serious problems,90636_1.txt
of the age. Perpetrators of this crime have almost invariably gone,90636_1.txt
unpunished. As a result a natural contempt for all law has been,90636_1.txt
inspired. This is especially true when the statutes do not suit their,90636_1.txt
fancy and immediate convenience. The conduct of the South during,90636_1.txt
the late war is a striking example of the growth of a disregard for,90636_1.txt
Federal Statutes. In certain districts the draft boards refused to,90636_1.txt
function. Needless millions were necessitated to carry on persuasive,90636_1.txt
propaganda. And yet hundreds of lives of Federal agents had to,90636_1.txt
be sacrificed in order to command a fair respect for the draft law.,90636_1.txt
The gravity of the lynching evil is rendered more serious by the,90636_1.txt
attitude of the American black man. He has been denied the protection,90636_1.txt
"of life. His accumulations are not secured. In fact, he has",90636_1.txt
been deprived of all the commendable objects of pursuit recognized,90636_1.txt
as essential in any satisfactory economic order. The government's,90636_1.txt
failure to take official notice of these unjust and fuedalistic practices,90636_1.txt
has caused the black man to lose confidence in the integrity of official,90636_1.txt
"America. Thousands of black men who today would be, and should",90636_1.txt
"be, productive economic factors have joined the ranks of the idle",90636_1.txt
and shiftless. A more dangerous type have concluded that justice,90636_1.txt
so far as they are concerned is conditioned upon the accuracy of their,90636_1.txt
aim and the weight of their blows. Recent racial clashes throughout,90636_1.txt
nation bear this out without need of further argument.,90636_1.txt
the This country has many titanic international questions to con-,90636_1.txt
front. The most optimistic among us do not doubt that the settlement,90636_1.txt
may require conflict. The fidelity of fifteen million cannot be,90636_1.txt
ignored in such a crisis. Unofficial organizations have collected a,90636_1.txt
lot of data on lynching. They had to take such data as was handed,90636_1.txt
to them by those who either committed the crime or were in sympathy,90636_1.txt
with it. When a Federal Commission backed up by the,90636_1.txt
Army and Navy goes into the bowels of Dixie and assures those who,90636_1.txt
have been victims of the crime that they will be immune from molestation,90636_1.txt
", new and startling disclosures will be made on the subject.",90636_1.txt
We are of the opinion that when this expose has been made and the,90636_1.txt
whole truth is placed before the American people in its nudeness,90636_1.txt
that public sentiment will be immediately organized to obliviate this,90636_1.txt
crime. Senator McCormick should be congratulated by the whole,90636_1.txt
"nation for his farsightedness. He is not only doing, the black man",90636_1.txt
"favor but the nation a service, a",90636_1.txt

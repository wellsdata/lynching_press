NEGRO KILLED AT MARSHALL.
His Slayer, Van Henderson, Refuses to Make
Any Statement.
( By the Associated Press.)
Marshall, N. C., July 30.- Belt Jackson,
a well known young negro about town
and at present working for the Chandley
Hotel, was killed on the streets here this
evening about 7 o'clock by Van Henderson
, son of Robert A. Henderson, the
present county jailer. Hardly any particulars
were obtainable as no one saw
Henderson when the shooting took place.
Four shots were fired three taking effect
,
in the side near the heart. The negro
died almost instantly.
No cause can be assigned as Mr. Henderson
has made statement to
no except
say that he" had it to do." He surrendered
immediately to City Marshal John
Barnes. There is some excitement over
the affair. The preliminary trial will be
held in the morning, and then perhaps
Henderson's motive in
killing the
negro
will be cleared up. The negro is regard-
ed as impudent and to a certain extent
dangerous, having served a term in the
county chain gang knocking a white
man in the head. for

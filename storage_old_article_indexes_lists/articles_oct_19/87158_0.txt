Philippi, W. Va., July 24.- Two negroes,
whose names are unknown, were lynchl
at Womelsdorf, near here, last night by an
angry mob numbering several hundred.
The first victim was shot and killed in
the stationhouse, and the second was taken
to the park, where he was hanged and then
riddled with bullets and cut to pieces.
Both whites and negroes are enraged and
in arms.
The trouble grew out of yesterday's mur
der of Chief of Police Wilmeth of Elkins.
Several other arrests have been made and
lynching seems imminent.
The dead blacks were caught near Bel
lington and locked up there, the officers
fearing lynching if taken to Elkins.
Negroes are leaving on every train.
The lynched men were horribly mutilated
and their bodies left on the
mons. com

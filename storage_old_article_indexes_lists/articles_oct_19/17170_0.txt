THE CRIME OF DE BAR.
There are some striking points of resemblance
between the crime committed by De
Bar, who was lately executed under Lynch
Law in Wisconsin, and that perpetrated by
the murderer Williams, in London, in 1812,
a graphic and thrilling account of which is
given in a lately published volume by De
Quincy. Each endeavored to kill a whole
family; in each the motives were the same,
revenge and greed of gold, and the very
same device was used by the murderer- ask
ing the occupant of the dwelling for a glass
of beer, and knocking him on the head as he
came up with it from the cellar. In both
cases the people endeavored to take into
their own hands the execution of justice- in
the London case however unsuccessfully, the
police proving too strong for the crowd, and
conveying the prisoner in safety to jail,
where he hung himself the same night
one of his suspenders. with
The hanging of De Bar by the mob has
drawn indignant comment from
the press, especially that portion of it which
is foremost in advocating resistance to such
laws as do not suit its own notions. We are
no advocates of Lynch law, but there are in
this case strong extenuating circumstances.
The crime was a most horrible one, and the
guilt of the criminal well ascertained; yet,
under the law of Wisconsin capital punishment
is abolished, and the monster who
Bought to imbrue his hands in the blood of a
whole household would have escaped the
just penalty of his crimes. De Bar himself
admitted that if the crowd were to hang him
they would serve him right. The people, it
is true, ought to have bowed to the majesty
of the law; but the occurrence shows the
folly of abolishing capital punishment.
Blood will be the penalty of blood, either
with or without the sanction of law. Monsters
who show themselves unworthy to live,
will have to die either
by
I
, the hands of the
law or of the people, who will, in any event
obey the great law of self preservation.,

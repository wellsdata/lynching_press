, BRUTAL ASSAULT
Of Simple- Minded Woman in
Muhlenberg
County.
Central City, Ky., June 6.- Mrs.
George Whitehouse, living near Be
vier, a village three miles distance
from here, on the L. and N. railroad
in the direction of Russellvile, was
criminally assaulted Saturday by
Harrison Alexander, eighteen years
old, at this place. The affair occurred
at the old camp meeting ground on
the road between Central City and
Bevier, and the negro was arrested
here at the carnival on Saturday
night.
Mrs. Whitehouse is an imbecile,
the wife George Whitehouse, who
ran off about two years ago with an
other woman. Joe Doolan, another
negio, was arrested at the same time
as was Alexander but the former
claims that he fought the latter in
defense of the woman and his story
is corroberated by Mrs. Whitehouse.
Alexander claims that both negroes
are guilty.
She was attacked in the public
road and pulled seventy yards to the
brush, and after committing the
crime Alexander endeavored to pull
her tongue out to prevent her telling
.
The negro has been arrested and
taken to the county jail at Greenville
and the officers will watch for evidence
of mob violence and place an
extra guard about the jail. This is
not the first time the Alexander ne
gro has been in trouble, and it is
feared he will have serious trouble
this time. The woman is in a critical
condition.
A crowd of 200 citizens from over
the entire county, went to Green
ville Tuesday morning, and demand
ed of the jailer, the negro.
The mob was quiet and orderly,
but very determined, and it was on
ly when the leaders had been taken
over the entire jail that they consented
to disperse and go to their
homes.
When it became known on Mon
day that the negro had been identified
by the woman, the officers decided
that it was best to take the negro
to Elkton, Todd county, out of reach
of a possible mob This precaution
alone saved the negro's. life.

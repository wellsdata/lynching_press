WIFE SMASHES GUN;
HE DIDN'T FACE MOB
Charles City Man Tells Minneapolis
Newspaper of the Lynching in
His City.
Minneapolis, Minn., Jan. 15.- Because
his wife smashed his shotgun over the
foot of the bed, G. R. Mosby of Charles
City, Ia., was unable to plead convinc
with the mob which lynched
James Cullen, the wife murderer, in
that city Wednesday night. Mr.
who is the son of a cousin of the famous
Colonel Mosby of civil war notoriety
, is a firm believer in law and or
der, and is ready to back his opinions
when the occasion arises, but Mrs.
Mosby has more use for a live husband
than a dead patriot. Consequently
when he announced his intention of
taking his gun and going out to argue
with the mob, she got to the weapon
first, and reduced$ 16 worth of Win
chester" pump" to junk with one swing
at the bedstead.

" Half the of Wednesday
night's lynching have not been told in
the press dispatches," said Mr. Mosby
at the Majestic hotel, where he is regIstered
today." My house fronts on
Main street, and is only a few blocks
from the bridge where Cullen
was
hanged. From my window I saw the
mob of hoodlums and fanatics drag the
shrieking, struggling maniac to his
doom.
" Down in the south, where I used to
live, sir, I have attended with pleasure
the taking off of some undesirable citizens
, but I have never seen anything
like this affair. It is one thing for a
party of righteously incensed men to
string up a nigger rapist and another
for a mob with women in it to hang a
lunatic in cold blood. I tell you, when
I heard a parcel of women sing' Nearer
My God to Thee,' as tine mob passed
under my window, it turned my stomach
.
" In Iowa we are fortunate in having
good courts and comparatively few
crimes. There is no need for lynch
law, and I am opposed to such a thing
except in extreme and peculiar cases.
This was no case for such a thing, and
if it had in my power I should
have stopped lain it."

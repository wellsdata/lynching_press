A REPORT from Birmingham, Ala., was
received one day last week stating that
at Warren a miner named Morton shot
and killed a deputy marshal. He was
arrested and put in jail, and because of
threats of lynching was put aboard of
the caboose of a freight train. The mob
followed and cut loose the caboose. They
Morton and filled his body with
hung bullets.

NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN VIEWS
OF RAPINGS.
If lychings do not cure the great evil
of rapings they are sure to lessen the
number of the brutes. You would sup
pose from the yellings of the northern
press over lynchings in the south
that they never occurred in the north,
and that the fellows lynched were no
ble specimens of humanity. The New
York Evening Post is now devoting
much time and space to the barbar
isms in the south- meaning the whites
lynch the devils and not the
who
brutes who are punished- and is try
ing to work up some fanaticism about
it in its own section. But really, if the
white women of character. and the defenceless
little children are to be crush
ed, killed, we opine that the rifles will
continue to be handled and the blood
hounds will continue to pursue, and the
" trial in the woods" will be held. We
believe that public sentiment is in fa
vor of an immediate trial by a regular
appointed court, and to protect refined
modest ladies from the awful ordeal
of a public examination. This being
done we do not say that rapes will be
discontinued. We believe, to the contrary
, that so long as there are brutes
of any color or race there will be assaults
upon women in unguarded
houses or upon the highways. In other
words, we doubt if courts can cure the
devilish work any more than lynch
ings have done so. But the wrong and
violence of the mob will be thus avoid
ed, which is a good deal. But court
trials or not, the people will be apt to
hunt with the rifles the infernal devils
who assault mothers and wifes and
sisters and daughters, and in spite of
governors and the northern press and
the congress.
At Wetumpka, Ala., a white man was
found guilty of helping to lynch a ne-
gro. This may be right ander the circumstances
. But if this sort of justice
is going to end lynchings in Alabama it
remains to appear. And then, it must
also stop rapes or it amounts to nothing
for the public good. A northern
negro sympathizer will go into jubila
tions over this, but does not care a
baubee for the poor, wounded, outraged
lady. The Evening Post is im
the Wetumpka
mensely happy over
finding and wants all the other lynch
ers to be jailed. It sees great redemptive
things in this, but it fails to say
if the rapers will continue their working
or be exterminated. The latter will
probably be the result.
Col. Robert L. Abernethy, of Hills
boro, a man of intellectual parts,
writes a communication to the Char
Motte Observer on immediate execution
of rapists. He writes with his accustomed
directness, frankness. and
force. He believes the courts are too
slow, and that the people will attend
to the cruel assaulters of the white
women and children. He says many
vigorous, striking things, and what he
says is really much in sympathy with
public sentiment. He writes, for in
stance:
" Of course, you will now and then
hear of some fellow bobbing up and
declaring against lynch law, when if
his wife or daughter had been assault-
ed like Mrs. Martin, he would be like
I am. It depends largely on who is
caught in the trap that causes people
to be against lynch law. I favor it
because one man's wife or daughter is
as much to him as the wife or daughter
of another is to him."
He thinks an officer who shouil
shoot an man" in order to protect a dir

with dynamite. Referring to Gov-
movement to stop
ernor Aycock's
lynching, he says he is right ,, but he

crimes that produce lynchings. He
says:
" I don't believe him when he asserts
that he will endeavor to bring all participants
in lynchings to the so- called
bar of justice, the courts. I cannot be
made to believe that there is a judge
or sheriff in the state( unless he him
self is a brute), that would make the
attempt to have his friends shot down
if they were wanting a scoundrel that
had committed on a member of his
family the same crime that was committed
on Mrs. Martin. I am in favor
of taking the criminals from the sheriffs

and there will be more or less lynch
ing so long as the nameles crime is
committted, and it would be better for
our officials to announce that they
of
surrender every guilty one
would
them to mobs when they wanted
them, and the brutes would not use the
courts for a cloak of escape, as there
would be no chance for them and less
of the crime would be committed."
If the brutes who roam and ravin
shall know that the state is no longer
but is hunting and
hunting them,
hounding the men who pursue and
not this in

crease rapes, invite the scoundrels to
continue their damning, bloody work,
and offer a chance of escape through

technicalities of

courts?

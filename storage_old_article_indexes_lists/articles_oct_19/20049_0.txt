Indianapolis Jail in Danger of
Storming.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Nov. 30.- The

for the blood of Charles Birsow.
an all- round criminal, and his latest
crime was an outrageous assault on a
little girl living in the northeastern part
of the city. A few men gathered in the
rear of a saloon in the same portion of
the city, and this was soon added
to. A descent was made upon the jail
by fifty sturdy fellows, and in the march
a force of 200 men joined in. The jail,
a flimsy old structure, was easily entered
, but the mob got no further than
the strong doors in the office.
At one time they were upon the point
of going into the blows of sledge hamn
mers and plying of crowbars, but the
sheriff and a posse of officers cleared
the room by a hard effort. Once
dispersed the backbone of the gang
weakened and from then on only cries
of," We want the brute, lynch him,"
and" Give him to us," etc. The office
again filled, but there was no further
attempt at breaking into the body
of the jail. Twenty minutes after the
first attempt the jail was surrounded by
officers. The ringleaders held another
meeting within two squares of the
a few minutes later. jail

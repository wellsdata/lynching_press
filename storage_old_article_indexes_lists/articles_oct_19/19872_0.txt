OMAHA, Neb., Oct. 10.- The Omaha
county jail was surrounded Friday
night by a howling mob of a thousand
men who declared they would lynch
Joe Coe, a negro who recently made
an attack upon Lizzie Yates, 5 years
old. It was reported that the child
was dead and this caused the outbreak.
Public sentiment has been wrought
up highly by the execution of Ed Neal.
This tension was added to when the
report became current that Coes' vietim
had died. We will lynch the nigger,"
was soon heard on every side and
it was evident that before nightfall
the day's event would culminate in
a tragedy. Night came on with an
on.inous quiet. There were few people
in the streets, and there was no intimation
of the trouble in sight. About
9:30 o'clock there were confused sounds
of a tramping and hurrying along the
paved street toward the county jail,
and in remarkably short time the
jail was a surrounded.

SAVES NEGRO FROM
ILLINCIS MOB
Lynching Averted at Carbondale
and Four Arrests Made.
Carbondale, Ill .: An unsuccessful
attempt was made Wednesday night
by a mob from this city to lynch the
mulatto, John Vaughn, who is under
indictment, charged with assault on
Miss Eva Kavanaugh, the school
teacher, near this city several weeks
ago.
The mob numbered about twenty
men who went to the county seat
in wagons and were met by Sheriff
Thorp. Deputy Sheriff Sylvester Hen
son and Deputy County Clerk A. J.
Woodward.
On finding that Sheriff Thorp in
tended to protect his prisoner at all
hazards, the mob dispersed after four
had been arrested by the Sheriff.
The attack had been planned for
some time, and Sheriff Thorp early
Wednesday evening learned that in
a few hours the mob would reach the
jail. He made but little preparation,
knowing that he could amply protect
his man. The men who were arrested
were discharged Thursday morning.
An accidental discharge of a revol-
ver wounded Deputy Woodward in
right arm. the

Alcide Mouton, the young colored
man who was lynched in St. Landry,
for the murder of his wife, guilty of in-
fidelity, showed, it is said, the most
poignant sorrow and regret for his deed
immediately after he had done it. It is
said that the mob who hung him, all
negroes, were for the most part drunk,
and openly defied the law and the officers
Fifteen of them are now in jail,
and. likely to suffer for their lawlessness.

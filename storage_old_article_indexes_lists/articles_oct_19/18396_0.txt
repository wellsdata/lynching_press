still in her teens. She is the daughter of
the sheriff who was absent from home
when a mob came to secure and lynch a
prisoner. Here is the story of her heroism
briefly told in the telegraphic account:
" The jail adjoined the Sheriff's house,
and he left the key with his daughter.
The young woman was called to the front
door about 10 o'clock. She found the yard
full of masked men. They declared they
had come to hang Moore. Miss Creech
said she would bring the keys from her
father's room.
" She was back at the door in half a min
ute, but the moon fell on the barrel of a
repeating rifle which was leveled. The
girl ordered the mob to scatter, and they
scattered."
There was no lynching. Men intent
upon taking the law in their hands were
compelled to stop and think as they look
ed into the determined eyes of that brave
girl and looked down the barrel of her
repeating rifle. She did them a great
kindness too, for most of them had doubt
less gathered, without time for reflection.

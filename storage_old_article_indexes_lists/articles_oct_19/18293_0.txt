American rapist, at the hamlet
called Clofton Summit in Tennessee
, was so unspeakably fiendish
that even those that
newspapers
have heretofore regarded such occurrences
as mere common- place
incidents were shocked into head
lining it as" unprecedented brutality
," and other strong expres-
sions of denunciation. First one
ear was cut off, then the other, his
fingers and thumbs, and his clothes
were torn away and he was hanged
to a telegraph pole, lowered and
his head cut off with pocket knives,
then hanged again by the feet
The head was preserved to be sent.

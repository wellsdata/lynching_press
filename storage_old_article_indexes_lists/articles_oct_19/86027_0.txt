Militia and a Posse Ready to Fight
the Lynchers.
Washington, Sept. 29.- A dispatch from
New Orleans says:" The brutal Quintu
lupe murder of John Cotton's family four
miles south of Independence, in Tangi
pahoa parish, is rapidly culminating in
trouble. The citizens have risen up in a
united demand for the delivery of John
Johnson, the murderer, and his alleged
accomplice, Arch Joiner, both negroes, and
a determined mob is forming from all the
adjoining parishes.
Reports from Amite City say 5,000 en
raged citizens are collecting, and will move
on that town, that being where Arch Join
er is imprisoned.
" John Johnson, the murderer, is confined
in the parish prison in this city, and one
of the demands of the mob is that he be
carried to the scene of the crime.
" Telegrams from Livingston parish say
the mob threatens to lynch the officials
who spirited the murderer Johnson away
and him to New Orleans if they
refuse brought to produce him."

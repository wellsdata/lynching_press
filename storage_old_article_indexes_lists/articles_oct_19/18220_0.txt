LOTUST GROVE, Ga., April 6.-
What is clearly another lynching of
another Negro worker here was revealed
when J. H. Wilkins, Pullman
porter of the Southern Railway was
found with his neck tied to a small
tree, and his knees touching the
ground. Wilkins' skull was fractured
in two places. Bruises and
cuts on his body showed that he had
been tortured and then lynched.
Railway officials and Georgia government
authorities are trying to
hide the whole affair under the guise
of mystery in order to cover up
trutal lynching of a Negro worker the.

ASHLAND FOLK TALK LYNCHING
Their Incentive a Dastardly Crime
Against a Miss of 12.
ASHLAND, Wis., May 25.- Rosa Young,
12 years old, daughter of a prominent
grocer here, was criminally assaulted
by Fred Egan, proprietor of a milk
farm. The little girl took her father's
wagon and went to deliver an order of
goods. Being unable to locate the
house she accosted Egan who had
previously been delivery boy for her
father. Egan got in the wagon and
delivered the goods and then assaulted
the child.
Driving back to the store
Egan picked the girl up, she being
half conscious, carried her into the
store and laid her down. He immediately
ran away. As soon as the girl
recovered she told of the crime, and
police were sent out after the culprit,
who was soon captured. Excitement
runs high, and summary vengeance is
talked of the girl's numerous
friends. by

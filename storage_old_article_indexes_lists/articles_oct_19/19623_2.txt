INDICT EVERY
MEMBER OF
URGES JURIST MOB
ST. JOSEPH, Mo.,- In a stern
denunciation of lynch law, Circuit
Judge J. V. Gaddy told a
special grand jury Monday that
every person who was active in
the
mob that lynched
Loyd
Warner, Negro youth, November
28," is guilty of murder in
first degree." une
grand jury to return inavunes.
The jurist called upon the
" It is necessary to pulsu tue
guilty members of tnac mo it
we are to protect ourselves against
the danger of the moo,
Judge Gaday said."
All Equaly Guiity
" The man wno pueu off the
jail aoor, or any man who help
ed in any way to preak into the
jail is just as guilty of muruer
as the man wno piaced the
around Warner's neck."" rope
Warner, suspected of attack
ing a white woman, was se.zed
after the mob had stormea tue
county jail. не was beaten,
stapped, hanged to a tree near
the
courthouse and his bouy
burned in the
presence of
crowd of 8000. a
" Every man who was active
in that mob is guilty of muruer
in the first degree and sacud
be indicted," Juage Gaday declared
to the grand jury, which
is made up of promuent clu
zens and headed by Henry Arug,
banker and president of the puo
lic libray borard.
" The danger of the mob lies
in the letting down of individual
responsibility. It wasn't a de
sire to administer justice or to
prevent a recurrence of Warn
er's crime which sent the mob
against the jail. It was hate,
the same passion that
ers any murder. engend
Morals Are Degraded
When you find the real lead
ers of that mob, you will find
men of not much higher moral
standards than the man they
murdered. If you had been
there that night, I doubt if you
could have picked 12 men from
that mob who would have had
the courage to convict and to
hang Warner
as members of
a jury in a court of justice.
Their action was murder in its
most despicable form, and an
assault on the institutions you
pay for and charge to admin's
ter justice.
" Women are no safer in St.
Joseph today by reason of tha
murder. And I want to tell you
men of the grand jury that the
Negroes of this community are
as law- abiding as our white citizens
. I am not offering a defense
of the victim of the lynch
ing. Perhaps he has no defense.
If Buchanan county institutions
are to exist there must be a
complete investigation of
lynching." this

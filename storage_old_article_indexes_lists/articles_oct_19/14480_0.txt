GEORGIA LYNCHING.
How a Body of Masked Men Treated a
Terror of the Neighborhood.
SAVANNAH, GA., September 17.
Three weeks ago, during the absence of
her husband, Mrs. Thomas Willis was assaulted
in her house in Rogers, on the
Central Railroad, by a negro. Mrs. Willis
defended herself gith a gun, which she
used as a club, but was on the point of
being overpowered when a colored girl,
armed with an ax, rushed to her assistance
, dealing the assailant several blows
on the head. The two woman, after a
desperate struggle, put the negro to flight.
As he ran he seized the gun and fired,
but the shot failed to do any harm,
carrying the

with him. On Tuesday afternoon Ed
ware Feye saw a negro named Wilker
son with a gun at No. 4 on the Central
Railroad, which answered the description
of the weapon carried off by

Willis outrage. It was decided to send
him to Millen for safe keeping. On his

to school and dragged

was a foregone
would follow, and an extra strong guard
was placed about the jail last night to pre
vent it if possible. The prisoner confessed
his guilt in the Brinson case, and said that
he had obtained the gun which led to his
arrest from a negro named Berry Wiggs.
Wiggs, who bears a bad reputation, was
working in the cotton fields about Millen
when Wilkerson was arrested, but on hear
ing of the charge against Wilkerson, immediately
disappeared, and has not been
seen since. Other links in this chain of evidence
leave no doubt that Wiggs is guilty
of the Willis assault, and posses of citizens
are scouring the country in search of
him. This morning Wilkerson was sent
to Sylvania to be lodged in jail there as a
better precaution against lynch law. This
move had been anticipated, however, and
as Wilkerson was proceeding across the
country, guarded by the officers, they
were met by a band of fifty masked and
well- armed men three miles from Millen.

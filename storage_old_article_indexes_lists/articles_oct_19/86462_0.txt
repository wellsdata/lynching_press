Crimes.
LYNCHING OF THE LYTTLETON MURDERER.
LYTTLETON, W. VA., March 25.- Early
Sunday morning John Wallace, the triple
murderer, was taken from Black's Hotel, at
Burton, by a band of fifteen masked men
and hanged to a tree within sight of the
railroad. All the passengers on the Sunday
express train saw him, as he was only
about fifteen feet from the track small
up a
man, six feet high, face white
,
ravine. A tall
as the driven snow, eyes open, head thrown
back, face turned upward, as if he was appealing
to the throne on high for mercy,
hands tied behind him, feet loose, one
pants leg in his boot and the other out; a
light- colored slouch hat on one side of his
head, dressed in sack coat, pants and vest,
made of home- spun goods of reddish gray,
with a rope around his neck, three feet
from the ground. He was taken down and
an the morning. His
father was telegraphed, and if he does not
come for the body it will be buried under
the tree where he was hanged. John Wallace
was overheard to say to the lynchers as
they were taking him out of the hotel:
" Henry Villars is the one who approached
about murdering them. I want to be
me hung, but want you to hang Villars."

SUPREME.
IT IS CRIME
Pierce City, Mo., is a town of 3,000
people. A girl was attacked by a negro
with lecherous intent as she was re
turning alone from church Sunday
morning and left dead by the side of
the railroad track, with her throat cut
from ear to ear.
For fifteen hours the population of
the town was in a frenzy of vengeful
fury. The supposed murderer was
banged. His grandfather was shot to
death. Another negro was cremated in
his cabin. The houses of five negroes
were burned down and thirty negro
families before rifles seized at the state
militia arsenal were driven from the
place to refuge in the weeds and woods.
And after fifteen hours of this work
the mob finds that it lynched an innocent
man and that the negro who tallies
with the description of the murderer is
in jail across the border in Indian territory
.
And so it proved once again, if that
were necessary, that a mob, with im
pulses all exaggerated and distorted,
cannot be depended on to do the swift
justice which it always angrily boasts it
can do.
The mob spirit seems to be growing
in recklessness, if that were possible.
This is believed to be the third or fourth
innocent man lynched in the last six
months. If brutality and savagery do
not deter from mob practices, will not
the awful mistakes of killing innocent
men have some effect? The very exist
ence of a mob, the very suggestion of a
lynching, is a rank injustice to every
of society.- Omaha World- Herald

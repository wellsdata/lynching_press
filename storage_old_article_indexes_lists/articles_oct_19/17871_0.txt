ANOTHER NEGRO LYNCHED
SOUTH CAROLINIANS SHOOT HIM
FIVE HUNDRED TIMES.
Charged With Attempting to Enter
the Window of a White
Girl's Home.
Columbia, 8. S. C.- William Spain, a
negro, 21 years old, was shot to death
by a mob near St. George, Dorchester
county. This is the third lynching
in South Carolina within ten days.
S. L. Connor, manager of the Dor-
chester Lumber Co.'s store at Bed-
ham, was notified by a negro that he
saw another negro attempting to enter
a window of his home, and then
run away into a nearby cane patch.
Connor notified his neighbors, and
about two hours later Spain was captured
and locked up in jail. Shortly
afterward a poss of forty of fifty men
went to the sheriff, and, securing the
keys to the jail, took the negro to the
house of Connor, where his 11- year- old
daughter positively identified the ne
gro as the one who had tried to climb
through the window.
The mob then took the negro to a
nearby oak three, strung him up to a
limb and fired about 500 shots into
his body,.

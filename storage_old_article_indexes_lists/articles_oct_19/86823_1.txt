A Few More" Regulars."
( New York Telegraph)
The 400 regulars who were ordered
to Lexington, Ky., for the purpose of
preventing a Negro lynching had a
very sobering effect on the lynch law
populace. The Kentucky National
Guard, suh- fine as it is, suh, but
narrowly averted another superb
southern hanging. If there were more
" regulars" in Kentucky and elsewhere
would not be so many incipient
lynchings there.

The Victim of a Crank Lover Dies of Her
Wounds- Talk of Lynching.
Special to the Sentinel.
MATTOON, Ill., May 1.- Miss Mary Sanders, the
young lady whose throat was cut by her would- be
lover, died on last night at the home
of her aunt, Mrs. Sanders, in Spring
Point Township, Cumberland County, The
half- witted murderer, Wm. Gallamore, was
promptly placed under arrest and given a preliminary
hearing this morning as he lav in bed with
an ugly self- inflicted gash in his throat,
in the same house where his
victim died. At times he seemed
rational and acknowledged the blood- stained
knife, with which the cutting was done, to be his.
He was held to answer at the August term of
court. The authorities removed him to the county
jail at Toledo, arriving late this evening. Galla
more tries to appear more crazy than he really is,
but his appearance indicates that he is not much
off mentally. The evidence seems to show that
it was a case of premeditated murder. Notwithstanding
his condition, there is a strong feeling
among Spring Point citizens to see speedy justice
follow the wanton murder. He is undoubtedly
safer behind the bars than in the vicinity
where the corpse of his victim lies. He tells
a disconnected story, admitting having eaten
dinner with the fair Miss Sanders Thursday, and
again claiming that he does not remember any
thing about the shocking deed, but does not seem
to be much scared. Late this evening small
groups of men are gathered in the streets of To
discussing the sad affair, and the usual talk
fedo of mob law is indulged in.

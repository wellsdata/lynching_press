Extract of a letter to a gentleman in New-
York, dated Gadiz, November 13.
" The news yesterday from the interior
of this country is of a very alarming
nature. In many places the people are
in a state of insurrection.- Want of
bread has driven the lower classes to
great extremity, and in consequence,
to some shocking outrages. In one town
poorer inhabitants have risen in a
the mob and hanged the governor."

WHITE MAN LYNCHED
Five Hundred Missourians Cheer While
Body Swings.
Lamar, Mo., May 29.- Shortly after
Jay Lynch had pleaded guilty to the
murder of Sheriff John Harlow and his
son and had been sentenced to life imprisonment
, twenty- four men entered
the courtroom, took Lynch from the
hands of officers and hanged him in the
yard before a crowd of 500 persons.
When Lynch's body was swung into the
air the spectators, including women and
children, cheered.
Lynch is one of the few white men
to be lynched in souri.
Immediately after Judge B. G. Thur
man passed sentence he ordered Lynch,
taken to his office under guard of seven
deputles. Here he was allowed to greet
his wife, baby, mother and sister. His
handscuffs had been removed that he
might hoid his baby, and he had just
given the child back to its mother wnen
the men entered and setzed him.
Lynch had been brought from Butler,
Mo., where he had been held in jail
since his arrest in Colorado several
weeks ago. There were no threats when
he was brought from the train to the
courthouse. There, was no show of violence
in the courtroom when the prisoner
was arraigned, and, according to
witnesses, the men composing, the mob
gathered in the corridors of the court
house and in the yard and no warning
was given of their action.
Capital punishment is not possible
under a law enacted by the legislature
in 1917. An attempt was made to re
peal the present law shortly after the
Lynch shooting, and the chief supporter
of the repeal of the law was Repre
Henry Chancellor, of Barton
county sentative, where Lynch was hanged,

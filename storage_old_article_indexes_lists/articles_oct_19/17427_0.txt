Tempe News: Constable Compton
this morning returned from Flagstaff,
bringing with him Wm. Adams, who
had been arrested at that place by the
Sheriff of Coconino county, upon instructions
from our authorities. About
six weeks ago J. C. Bohannan, living
south of town missed a lot of wheat.
Adams was suspected as being the
thief; a search warrant was sworn out
and some of the missing grain was
found concealed on his premises.
Adams then skipped out to avoid arrest.
This forenoon in Judge Spafford's court
he plead guilty to the charge. He was
fined$ 200, and being unable to produce
the requisite amount filthy lucre, he
was sent to the county of jail for 200 days.

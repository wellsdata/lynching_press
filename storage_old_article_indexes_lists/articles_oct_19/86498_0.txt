The Criminal Mob.
( Tampa Tribune.)
No mob is inspired by any chivalrous thought
of defending womanhood or righteously avenging
the murder of some popular man. The mob is
selfish, doing what it pleases, for its own sordid
exactly the same spirit which a few
purposes,
hours before moved its victim to commit his
crime. The mob and the victim are brothers
under the skin, whether the victim's skin is
black or white. In fact, the mob is an acces
sory to the crime, assisting the murderer or attacker
, although in its ignorance the mob may
not think so. The mob, instead of increasing
the punishment as the law would, relieves the
victim of punishment.***
If the mob's purpose were to insure punish
ment, when it caught a man it would turn him
over to the law and use its influence for a prompt]
and fair trial.
A few days ago a Mississippi mob lynched,
one man. In the same State a few days ago
man was duly hanged for murder. The
another
second man suffered more punishment. In the
first case the innocent public- society- suffered.
If you ever see a member of a mob, you see
who is a criminal, and probably one of weak
one mentality.

ministering justice, lynch law as it is called, how
ever much the circumstances may seem to justify
it. In the present case the excitement was very
great, one of our most respected citizens had been
shot down in the presence of his friends, by a desperado
, without the least provocation, and even
after the deed was done, the offender seemed t
feel no compunction for the crime he had committed
. When asked how he could thus, without
cause, murder a valuable citizen, his answer was,
" I don't care a d- n, if you don't like what I
have done, help It was also in
proof, that beth him and his friend Stephenson
were in several drinking houses during the evening
, and seemed determined to have a row, no
matter with whom. They declared themselves
frue sons of Texas, and that they could clear the
town. At the bar, in the Exchange, they drew
their pistols on the bar- keeper because he refused
to advance them a loan of ten dollars on one of
their pistols, voiciferating again that they were
from Texas and could take the town. This con
duct had its effect in producing the final and un
result that closed the business of the
fortunate evening.

We are glad to perceive that Senator Sumner of
Massachusetts, is willing to admit that he has so
far recovered his health as to take part in the
Presidential campaign. We thought that the ar
dent abolitionist would find it hard to keep out of
such a melee as the present, and are not surprised
to find that, in his eagerness for the triumph of the
champion of abolitionism, his valor has over
come his discretion. We are by no means advocates
of Lynch Law, but we hope the Senator will
learn from his mortifying experience, the importance
of abstaining from assaults upon the
tion and character of others. reputa

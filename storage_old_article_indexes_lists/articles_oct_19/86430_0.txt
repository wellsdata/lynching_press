, THE MURDERERS of Marshal Brenner
will be on trial next week. In view of
. the alarming increase in crime amounting
to an epidemic, from which no one seems
to be safe, it is to be hoped that they will
have swift justice done them. Society
cannot afford to have them turned loose
to certainly return to the life of crime up
, on which they have entered. It cannot be
doubted that to the frequency of escapes
from justice by the technialities of law,
the general laxness of public sentiment,
and the idiotic sentimentality so prevalent
we are indebted for this unparalled reign
of crime, and also for the disposition
among law- abiding people to resort to
lynch law to put it down. Unless there is
a radical change in administration, we
shall be lynching as common as in
fornia history. Cali-

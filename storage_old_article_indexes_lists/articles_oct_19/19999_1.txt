DESERVED TO BE LYNCHED.
A Burly Brute Assaults an Eight
Year- Old Girl.
Special to the Globe.
SIOUX FALLS, S. D., Dec. 30.- A war
rant was issued this afternoon for the
arrest of William Jackson, an inmate of
the county poor house upon the charge
of attempted rape upon an eight- year
old colored girl, also an inmate of the
poor house. The circumstances of the
assault are very revolting, and but for
the timely appearance of one of the
officers of the institution the outrage
would have been successful. Jackson
was a track walker on the Milwaukee
road between this city and Keyes, and
was taken sick with pnemonia about a
month ago and was taken to the poor
farm. The little girl has been on the
poor farm for four years. The evidence
against Jackson is very strong,
and from the source it is learned,
is not the first offence. this

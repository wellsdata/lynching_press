Gordon, the Murderer- Attempt to Lynch
Him- The Mob Rampant. d
LEAVENWORTH, K. T., September 18,
Gordon, the alleged recently
escaped from Denver, and who has
been in the custody of the United States
Marshal for some time past, had an examination
yesterday before Judge Petit, of the
United States District Court, which resulted
in his discharge for want of jurisdiction, it
having been shown that Denver, where the
offense is alleged to have been committed,
is in Moritana County, and not in Arrapa
hoe, as was supposed. This decision leaves
side of Arrapahoe County, without any law
After the discharge of the prisoner personal
threats of Lynching were made, and
an excited crowd gathered around the
Court- room. Gordon, however, was taken
to the jail for safety, under the protection
of the Sheriff and city officers.
Late in the evening a body of his friends
undertook to remove him thence, but were
immediately surrounded by an excited
crowd, shouting," Hang himi"" String him
up!"& c.
The friends of law and order, however,
under the lead of Mayor McDowell and other
city officers, succeeded in preventing the
mob from proceeding to extremities, and
Gordon was again lodged in jail for safety.
He was badly bruised and cut during the
melee, and others were somewhat injured.
Sheriff Meddough, of Arrapahoe County,
who arrived in town during the tumult, was
badly injured by a blow on the head.
Gordon has been rearrested, on a justice's
warrant, and will be taken to Denver as soon
as his injuries will permit.
The affair causes much excitement in this
city, and our citizens are, generally,
with the triumph of law and order. satisfied

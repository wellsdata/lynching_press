Negro Woman Lynched.
LITTLE ROCK, March 12.- The colored
population of Little Rock is greatly exercised
over the reported ghastly dis-
covery made by several of their color in
returning from Marche. About half
way between this city and Marche, they
found the dead body of a young mulatto
.woman, probably, about 30 years old,
suspended to the limb of a tree .. On her
bosom was a placard bearing the inscription
:" If anybody cuts this body down
they will share the same fate." Several
parties reported finding the body. It is
supposed the woman was lynched, but
when, by whom and for what reason, no
one has been able to state. The body appeared
to have been several
days. 6 suspended

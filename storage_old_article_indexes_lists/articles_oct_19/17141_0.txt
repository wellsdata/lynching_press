The Portland Argus says: We are deeply
pained that such an ou'rage should have
been possible in the State of Maine. We
concur with The Mercury in the hope that
the perpetrators of this wrong may be severely
punished. Meanwhile, if Mr. Bapst
was assailed for no other reason than his religion
, the subject will deserve some further
(
consideration and coinment. The outrage
will not then be entitled even to the poor
charity of being considered a case of Lynch
Law because Lynch Law is usually regar
she
ded as the result of some public fury in con
sequence of a known crime, and in this country
we in Heaven that a msn's religious
opinions trust cannot constitute him a criminal.

Murder of a Lawyer at El Paso, Ill.
CHICAGO, May 3.- Walter Bullock, a lawyer
and old citizen of Woodford county, was shot
and instantly killed at El Paso last night by
P. C. Ransom, who was badly defeated in the
recent municipal election for mayor. Bullock
was standing on West Front street talking to a
friend and made some remark about the election
as Ransom passed by. Ransom stopped
and ordered him to retract his words, and up
on his refusal to do so pulled out a revolver and
shot him three times, once through the head,
then through the heart and once in the shoul
der. Bullock fell, gasped two or three times
and died. Ransom walked down the street
and waited in front of the bank building until
arrested. He was followed to jail by an infuriated
mob, crying" Lynch him, lynch him,"
but no attempt was made to interfere with the
officers. The feeling against Ransom in
community last night was very bitter. the

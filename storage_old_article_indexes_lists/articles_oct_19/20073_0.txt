Ku Kluxers Foiled.
LOUISVILLE, Nov. 3.- Last night a mob
collected about the jail in Jeffersonville,
Ind., with the intention of lynching a negro
named John Washington, who had attempted
a rape on a little white girl, whose father
died from the excitement produced by the
outrage. The prisoner was slipped out the
backway, and conveyed to the State prison,
learning which the mob dispersed. This
morning prisoner was taken to the jail
at Charlestown the, Ind.

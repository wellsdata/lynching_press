Lynching Not Subject
To Geographical Lines
THE
lynching of three negroes at
Duluth, Minn., for assault on
a white girl is no more of a surprise
than had the lynching taken place in
Mississippi, Alabama, or Georgia.
Where that crime occurs the mob
metes out punishment. Man will
care for his women and he who abuses
them is headed to quick immolation
on the altar of instinct. As faith
rises above mathematical demonstration
, man's protective spirit in relation
to woman brushes restraint aside
and goes straight to the mark of
ural law. nat-
More lynchings occur in the South
simply because there are more ne-
groes in the south and the crime is
oftener perpetrated here. The difference
between the north and the south
with respect to the negro is that the
| south stops at the individual criminal,
while the north, once the racial feeling
is aroused, strikes with ungovernable
rage at numbers.
Negroes are sometimes lynched
for other causes than attacks on
women. So have white men been
lynched for other causes, both north
and south. The west strung up cattle
thieves summarily. Lynchings
for causes other than attacks on women
in the south have been the product
of the habit of lynching for that
crime. Stop that crime and lynch-
ings will be few and far between.
Had the Duluth crime occured in
Geo- gia the actual assailant would
have been lynched. In Duluth they
went at it in wholesale style.
Not long ago in Knoxville, a south-
ern city, the arm of the law extended
to the protection of a negro fiend who
had ravished and murdered a number
of women, the last a white girl in
her early teens. Members of the mob
were shot down and killed. The negro
was tried, convicted and suffered
the law in the usual way.
In Duluth thirty policemen in the
jail enclosure gave way to the mob
after the sole and ridiculous effort of
dispersing it with a stream of water.
The would make greater
negro
progress toward the elimination of
lynching if less attention were paid
to lynching statistics and more to
preachment of the inevitable consequence
of this cropping out of the sav
age in the race.
More progress would be made in
securing full justice in the courts
were a stop put to the habit of har
boring known criminals..

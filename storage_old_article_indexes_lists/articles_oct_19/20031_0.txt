WHAT WAS DONE WAS DONE WELL
Comments of the New Orleans Pa
pers on the Lynching.
NEW ORLEANS, March 15.- The" States"
says editorially:
Yesterday the cancer that has been for years
gnawing at our social system until good mens'
hearts near despaired- the hideous Mafia- was
once for all, amid torrents of blood, flercely root
ed out by the people's strong arm and with the
deople's instruments. The assassins of our chief
of police have been executed; peace to their ash
es. The evils which 1emain to aflet our community
- a vicious jury system and suborners liv
ing among ns- are not of that deadly character
which demands heroic treatment. The offenses
of the perjured juror, of the convicted suborner
may well be remitted to the slower and more de
liberate judgment of a court of justice. Let con
stitued authorities move against the jury who out
raged justice and insulted common sense.
The" Times- Democrat," commenting edi
torially on the events of yesterday, after referring
to the laxity of criminal justice in
this city for a year or two past, says:
This paralysis of justice was due neither to the
incompetency of the police nor the incapacity of
the officials appointed to administer laws. It
was due to the settlement in New Orleans of law
less bands of men halling mostly from Southern
Italy, who brought to this country of treedom and
free institutions the pernicious ideas and murderous
methods whien planted conspiracy and assassination
societies in their quondam home, and
which enable the members of these societies to
defy detection and laugh justice to scorn. The
short, sharp and decisive drama of yesterday had
in it, moreover, a waraing for another class,
which they will do well not to disregard. We re
ter to jury fixers, who are experts at getting at
talesmen and jurymen and filling the jury box,
partial y or wholly, with men pledged to consuit
above all things the interests of the criminals,
and see that convictions shall not be arrived
by juries against them. at

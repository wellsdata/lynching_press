Rescue Negro Who Fights with White
Man from Angry Crowd in
Colorado.
FLORENCE, Colo., May 26.- A riot at a
base ball game here today nearly resulted
in the lynching of Jason Wilson, a negro.
Wilson was driving a buggy and trying
to pass every one on the road, which was
crowded with vehicles.
He collided with a buggy, occupied by
Onnie Carroll, a white man, and the two
began a fist fight. The crowd closed around
them and finally began beating and kicking
the negro.
A half dozen officers rescued the negro
barely in time to save his life and then
,
only standing the crowd off with their
revolvers by.

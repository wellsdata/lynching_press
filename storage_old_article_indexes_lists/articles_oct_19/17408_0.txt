ROBBERY AND ATTEMPTED MURDER- Oliver
J Marston, of the firm of Marston& Turner,
Middlesex county, Va, was found lying insensibie
in the road, near that place, on Thursday last,
beaten over the head with a heavy instrument,
and robbed of a gold watch. He is also believed
to have been shot, the report of fire arms having
been heard and there being marks of buckshot
about bis head. On Saturday, he was lying in a
hopeless condition. A slave named George, belonging
to Mr. Thomas W. Fauntleroy, of that
place, was arrested upon the charge of having
committed the outrage, and the excitement was
such as to render lynch law being applied to him
improbable, the unfort..nate man being a prominent
not and highly esteemed citizen.

Five California Men Lynched for Stealing.
Details have been received of the
lynching of five men at Lookout, Mo
doe county, Cal., early on the morning
of the 31st. The men lynched had been
suspected of stealing for some time,
and recently they were arrested, and a
search of their premises revealed the
stolen plunder. On the day in question
a mob, variously estimated at from
30 to 50 people, suddenly made their
appearance at the hotel and, pointing
their guns at the two officers on guard,
commanded them to observe silence
while they secured the five prisoners,
placed ropes around their necks and
dragged them to a nearby bridge, and
strung the entire bunch up. One of
the prisoners made such strong resistance
that the mob hanged him before
it got to the main bridge. Both of the
guards were compelled to accompany
the prisoners to the scene of the
cution. exe

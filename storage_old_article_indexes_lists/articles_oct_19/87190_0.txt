The late outrage at Jonesboro, Georgia,
is creating quite a sensation and ex-
citement everywhere throughout that
State. It appears that a band of some
twenty masked men repaired to the
residence of one Joe Thompson( colored)
on the night of the 28th ult., and beat
him very severely, as also his wife, and
murdered his daughter. Some of the
maskers were recognized by Thompson,
who avers that they belong to the
higher classes of the community of
Jonesboro. The difficulty originated in
the fact that Thompson had testified
against one of these worthies on a trial
before one of the justice's courts, and
that his testimony was very damaging
in its effect. No other cause is assignedness
for the outrage committed upon this
peaceable family than that. The accused
parties have all been arrested and
jailed. The threats of the negroes are
so alarming, and the excitement so
great, that Governor Colquitt has or-
dered the militia of the county to go
down from Atlanta as it is feared the
negroes will try to lynch, the prisoners.

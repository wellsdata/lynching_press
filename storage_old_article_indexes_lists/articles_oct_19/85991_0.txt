Another attack was made upon the police
of Cork, Ireland, in the street, on the 10th
inst., by a mob who pelted them with stones
and bricks. The police, who were armed
with muskets, fixed bayonets and charged
on the crowd. A short and desperate fight
followed, in which several of the rioters
were bayonetted. The assailants then fled
in all directions, leaving their wounded on
the ground. During the day an attempt
was made to seize and lynch a well known
informer, but the appearance of the police
patrol prevented the outrage being
out. carried

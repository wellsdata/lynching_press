INEXCUSABLE LAWLESSNESS.
The lynching of Murderer Higgins
on his arrival at Bancroft from Omaha
in custody of the sheriff is a piece of
inexcusable lawlessness.
in the south is a common occurrence
shaken off. The lynching of a negro
quickly forgotten, but the lynching of
white man in Nebraska puts a blot
on the name of the state not easily
punishment of homicidal crime. The
miscarriage of justice in the courts,
coupled with the flagrant abuse of the
pardoning power, reaching a culmination
under Governor Mickey, have furnished
the fuel to this fire.
The lynching of Murderer Higgins,
however, has simply produced another
murder for which the law should leave
no stone unturned to fix the culpability
and to exact the penalty.-

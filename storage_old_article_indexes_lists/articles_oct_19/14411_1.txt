OUT OF COURT AND LYNCHED.
Witnesses Were Introduced to Defame
a Girl's Character.
Smithville, Tenn., Aug. 8.- Charles
Davis, on trial for an attack upon
Miss Kate Hues, was taken from the
court room by a mob of the friends
and relatives of the girl and lynched.
The immediate cause of the lynching
was the introduction of witnesses in an
effort to defame the girl's character.
Davis made an effort to jump from the
second story window, but was captured
before he escaped. About 1,500 men are
in town from the country. The sheriff,
a deputy, a constable and the defendant's
father were wounded in clash
with the mob. a
A MULTI MURDERER
Taken Where He is the Most Likely
to be Hanged.
J. E. Young, a sheriff of La Grande
county, Utah, arived in town on Wednesday
morning on an important er
rand, the end of which will no doubt
be the leaving of a black ring about
the neck of a man.
He wanted requisition papers for the
return of Tod Carver to the county of
La Grande honored. There was a fond
hope that Carver might be hanged in
this territory, but wherever it is done,
will be all the same in thousand
it a
years.
About a year ago a band of cattle
rustlers were operating in the northern
part of the territory. They were pur
sued by various posses and one day
the outlaws ambushed in
a posse
Apache county and killed Frank Le
Seueur and a man named Gibbons. Le
Seueur was a prominent young man,
the son of a county official. Carver was
believed to be one of the outlaws and
,
by the way, Bravo Juan, who after
ward operated with Burt Alvord in
the southern part of the territory, an
other. A few months ago Carver was
arrested in New Mexico and brought
back to Apache county on a requisition
. It was subsequently learned
that he had killed a sheriff and deputy
sheriff in La Grande county, Utah.
The present sheriff of La Grande county
went to St. Johns and represented that
there was no doubt of Carver's conviction
of that crime. The proof was
dead against him. The sheriff had at
requisition for him, and on Sheriff
Young's representation District Attorney
Ruiz of Apache wrote Governor
Murphy recommending that Carver
be extradited; while he was probably
guilty of he murder of LeSeueur,
proof of his guilt might fail. It was
proper that he should get off the
earth, and if he could make a surer
jump from a Utah scaffold than from
an Arizona structure, it was the opinion
of District Attorney Ruiz that he
ought to make the leap in La Grande
county. The requisition was honored
and yesterday morning Sheriff Young
left for St. Johns to get Carver and
take him home. There are few, and
perhaps no instance on record of a
man having been extradited from
states or territories. two

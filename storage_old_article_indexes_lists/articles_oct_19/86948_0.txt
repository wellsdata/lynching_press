NEGRO LYNCHED FOR
- ATTACK ON OFFICER
Black is Taken From Foreman
Jail and Hanged to Cotton
Derrick- Coroner's Jury Did
Not Fix Responsibility.
Foreman, Aug. 9.- Aaron Jimerson,
a negro about 35 years old, was taken
from jail here last night by a mob
and hanged to a cotton derrick near
the main business section of the town.
The negro had made a murderous attack
upon City Marshal Sam Anderson
, who also is constable and deputy
sheriff.
The attack was made shortly before
noon Wednesday, just as the negro
was being returned to jail, following
an examining trial on a charge of assault
with intent to kill, preferred by
some negroes at whom he had fired
five times with a revolver several
days ago. The marshal was unlocking
the door of the jail when the negro
seized a block of wood and knocked
the officer down. He suffered severe
bruises about the arms and body.
The negro then ran to the woods, but
was pursued by Marshal Anderson
and several other men. He was retaken
at the edge of town with little
difficulty and returned to jail.
Just what time the negro was taken
from jail is not known. His body was
found hanging to the cotton derrick
about daylight this morning. The
held an inquest, but the jury
coroner fixed no responsibility.

Terrible Crime in Missouri.
LAMAR, Mo., Jan. 18.- A dispatch
from Kenoma, a station seven miles
from here, gives the details of one of
the most atrocious crimes ever known
in Missouri. Robert Helper had been
drinking during the day and about 4
o'clock went to the house of Mrs.
Gocdly and murdered that dady and
her youngest child,& bey about 6
years old, and left for dead her daughter
aged 9 years. Mrs. Goodly's head
was crushed with a heavy- bottomed
chair, one arm and her jaw broken. He
assaulted the girl with a heavy iron
poker, striking her, he supposed a fatal
blow and left her lying across her moth-
er's prostrate form. The little boy came
next and his head was crushed to a
jelly. Five of Mrs. Goodly's children
were abrent from home at the time and
on returning shortly after found the
bodies as above described and gave the
alarm. When help arrived the little
girl revived enough to tell who the mur
Mrderer war, he was arrested and
brought here and, thereby preventing lynch.

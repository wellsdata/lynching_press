Hanging for Lynchers.
( N. Y. Advertiser.)
Lynching negroes in the South for
crimes of violence upon women, when
any attempt has been made to justify
it. has been defended upon the ground
that the process of justice through the
courts there was too slow and uncer-
tain, and that the guilty were more
than likely to escape the gallows in the
end While this was no excuse or pai-
.
liation for a crime that is indefensible,
it appears that in Georgia two days
ago a mob of lynchers had not even
this ground for a defense. Six hundred
men broke into a court room where a
negro was on trial for rape, took him
from the custody of the court and
hanged him. They could not plead
the likelihood of an acquittal, for the
evidence that proved the culprit's guilt
to them would have convicted him in
court. This crime was committed in
the broad light of day, and most of
perpetrators must be personally known the
to the judge and all the officers of the
court in Columbus If several hundred
.
indictments and trials for murder do
not speedily follow, the people of
Georgia must admit that public sentiment
there does not revolt at open
murder or at open defiance of the
courts of justice.
Resolutions of indignation and news
paper editorials deploring the crime
can no longer be accepted as reflecting
public sentiment in that section. The
only way to impress the outside world
with the honesty of their declarations
is for the people of Columbus to put
all these lynchers on trial, convict
them and punish them to the full ex
tent of the law- by hanging, if the
verdict shall justify it. A dose of their
medicine is the only approved
own treatment for lynchers.

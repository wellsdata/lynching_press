From the Chicago Tribune.
The unexpected has happened in Ala
bama. George Howard, a farmer, member
of a mob that lynched a negro near We
tumpka some months ago, has been con
vieted of murder in the first degree and
been sentenced to imprisonment for life.
During the trial Howard admitted his
participation in the lynching and gave
the names of thirteen of his companions
who may yet be his associates in the penitentiary
.
There is special reason for satisfaction
with this conviction, because it was obtained
in one of the four states which
have been chief offenders in mob mur
ders. If a similar result could be reached
in other Southern states, and Northern
ones also- for in proportion to the num
ber of negroes and the degree of general
knowledge Indiana, Colorado and Kansas
are just as conspicuous offenders as Ala
bama, Georgia, Mississippi and Louisiana.
-there would soon be an end of lynching
and a restoration of the law's authority.
The Alabama conviction, taken in connection
with recent legislation and with
executive action in support of sheriffs in
that and some other states, shows that
there is a radical change of sentiment on
the part of state authorities and that they
are awakening to a realizing sense of a
new and alarming danger confronting
them- the danger of mob law in the place
of legal justice. So far as the negroes
themselves are concerned, lynching ply
leads to blind and fierce resentment. So
far as crime is concerned, it does not
have any deterrent effect." On
trary," says the State of Columbia the 3.

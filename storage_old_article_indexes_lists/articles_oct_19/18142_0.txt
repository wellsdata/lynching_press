ONLY ONE NEGRO LYNCHED
AT CARUTHERSVILLE
CARUTHERSVILLE. Mo., Oct. 12.- Officials
of this city and of Pemiscot county
thus far have made no effort to identify
members of the mob which took two negroes
from the jail early Wednesday
morning, lynched one of them and drove
the other out of town.
It is now claimed that the negro Ben
Woods, known also as" High Pockets,"
arrested for annoying two young white
women, did not meet the fate of A. B.
Rich, who was shot and his body thrown
in the Mississippi river. It is said that
after a severe whipping he was released
and that he fled to Tennessee. The attitude
of officials of the town and county
is approximated in the following com
ment today by Mayor Garrett:
" Unless a complaint is made by some
one who can prove that a mistake was
made in killing the negro Rich. will
take no action." I

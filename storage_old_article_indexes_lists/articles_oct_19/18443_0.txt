It is to be hoped that the three negroes
in jail at Henderson charged with
the murder of Roadmaster Stevers will
not be lynched. Let the law take its
course. Nothing can be gained by
mob law. It will only bring a stigma
upon the county of Vance and the entire
state. We are sorry to see that it be
came necessary to call out two companies
of the state guard to protect the
men Friday night. Their crime was a
terrible one, but the law strong
enough to punish them. is

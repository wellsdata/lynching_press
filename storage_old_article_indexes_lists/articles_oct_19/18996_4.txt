Omaha Cops Attack
Scottsboro Protest
OMAHA, Neb.- Police attacked and
broke up an open- air Scottsboro-
Mooney and
arrested three workers. George Stalker
is held for deportation. Two
others are held incommunicado by
police.
Protest meetings are scheduled for
Bethel Baptist Church on Monday,
and Ahamo Hall Thursday evening.
At the meeting which was broken
up, Williams Pickens, assistant national
director of the NAACP, was
denounced in roaring protest by the
workers for his continued betrayal
of the Scottsboro boys' defense.
At a meeting here last week, Pick-
ens, on tour for the NAACP in an
attempt to divert the mass protest
against the Scottsboro lynch verdict,
opened up with an attack upon the
Communist Party, and the International
Labor Defense and the Scotts-
,
boro Defense.
Sue Stalker, ILD organizer rose to
ask him to make a statement of his
stand on the Scottsboro case itself.
" Please call an officer and have the
lady arrested," was Pickens' answer.
" There were only ten lynchings in
the United States last year," Pickens
said." You should have faith in the
U. S. Supreme Court to save the
Scottsboro boys."
There were at least 37 lynchings of
which public record was made, in
1932, the ILD out, and all
news was suppressed pointed of many others.

Red Moon Indians May Resist the Provocations
of the Cow Men.
WICHITA, Kan., April 16- Information
received from Fort Reno says that a
troop of cavalry has been dispatched to
the Red Moon district in Cheyenne and
Arapahoe country, the scene of the recent
fight between the whites and Indians
against the threatened extermination
by the cow men. It seems that
the cow men demanded the surrender
of redskins who killed Breeding, and
when Farmer Harman, in charge of the
district, permitted representatives of
the cow men to go to the Indian camp
to pick out the alleged culprits, they
pretended to identify two Indians who
it is known were not in the district at
the time of the killing. There was an
attempt to lynch these two men by the
cowboys, which was frustrated. The
Red Moon Indians have now left their
district and have gone to join old Chief
Whirlwind, who is just in mood to
start them on the warpath if the
men should give them much more provc cattle

Negro for an Alleged Attack on a
White Girl- Nine Men Face
Murder Charge.
Tyler, Texas.- A company of Texas
Rangers fired over the heads of a
mob that attempted to tak e nine
men from jail here after they had been
locked up for alleged participation in
the lynching of Jim Hodge, a negro,
on May 1, and as a result there is
much bitter feeling, and the outbreak
of a race war is feared.
Nineteen men were held for the
lynching and their preliminary hearing
was concluded late Thursday. Nine
of them were ordered to jail by the
presiding judge.
When this became known a mob of
several hundred people formed and
went to the jail. A company of
Rangers was thrown about the jail.
When the mob became threatening the
soldiers ordered them back, and when
they refused to disperse a volley was
ordered. The bullets whistled over the
heads of the mob and its members
scattered. There were threats after
wards that an attempt would be made
to rescue the men held and the situation
Friday is worrying the officers,
who fear another clash.
Hodge was lynched for an alleged at
tack on a white girl. It was afterward
declared that the negro had not been
identified, and that he was not the one
who attempted the assault.
Hodge was taken from the jail and
hanged to a scaffolding around the unfinished
courthouse. When it was found
that the wrong negro had been hanged
the act was denounced as murder.
The nine men jailed face a formal
charge of murder. If convicted, they
will be the men sentenced for
lynching a negro first in Texas.

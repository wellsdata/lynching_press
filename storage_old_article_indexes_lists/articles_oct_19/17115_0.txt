and Law in Mississippi.
A few days ago, a Mrs. Redan, residing
in Marshall county, Miss., and who
was lately married, went into a field on
some business, where a negro man was

ing she was alone, seized her, violated
her person, and then, by threats, induced
her to promise to say nothing about it.
Soon after, however, she did give the
alarm, when the fiend left his plough and
deliberately walked to where she was and
ravished her the second time. After accomplishing
his hellish purpose, he choked
his vietim to death, thereby committing a
double erime, and then resumed his
ploughing, as if nothing had happened.
In a few hours the lifeless corpse was
found, but no trace of the murder could be
discovered, until a pair of hounds were
brought and placed upon the scent of the
track. They immediately traced the
track of the negro, who was still ploughing
but he denied all knowledge of the
,
affair. At length he confessed the committal
of the deed, giving a full statement
of everything. The excitement became
intense, and the people gathered from
every quarter, and the black wretch was
laken by the infuriated crowd and first
castrated and then hung by his neck until
nearly dead. He was then taken down
and hung by his heels until life was near-
extinct, when he was shot by some
ly ten or a dozen men in the crowd.

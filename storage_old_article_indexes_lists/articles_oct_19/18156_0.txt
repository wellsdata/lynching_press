Roberts, Sevenet and Gorman, the
Humboldt county murderers under sentence
of death at the penitentiary, have
about concluded that their case is hope
less. When the news of the attempted
lynching of the Negro Reeves at Reno
reached them, Sevener said:
means the death of us fellows; we might
have obtained a new trial if this did not
happen, but we will surely hang now."
They seem cheerful and do not seem to
realize that they will hang on February
10th If the supreme court does not
a stay of execution. grant

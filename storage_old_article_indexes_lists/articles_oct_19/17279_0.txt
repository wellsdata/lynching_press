dangers, far too many of us neglect or are hesitant
about acting upon our knowledge. It is not enough
to know the facts, but we must act upon them. Out
of the dislocations and upheaval of the present there
will be fashioned the patterns and ocial concepts
which will influence the history of the country for
a long time to come. The enlightened public opinion
of America must be roused to the urgency of making
democracy work now and in the future. Every
portunity must be seized to" educate" the people
who now do not realize the relationship between
lynching a Negro and discrimination against a Jew
or the denial of a living wage to a white worker.
Here is the job for all of us who believe in the tenets
of democracy, defeat the poll- tax and run the native
fascists ruin, promote national unity and destroy
every vestige to of Hitlerism here and abroad.

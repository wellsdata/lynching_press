Lynching of Italians in Colorado.
The deplorable lynching of several Italian
laborers in Colorado was naturally followed by
international representation and I am happy
to say that the best efforts of the State in
which theso outrages occurred have been put
forth to discover and punish the authors of this
atrocious crim. The dependout families of
some of the unfortunate victims invite by their
deplorable condition gracious provision for
their needs. These manifestations against
helpless aliens may be traced through succes
sivo stages of the vicious padroni system which
unchecked by our immigration and contract
labor statutes, controls these workers from them
ment of landing on our shore, and farms
them out in distant and often rude regions.
where their cheapening competion in the fields
of bread winning toil brings them in collision
with other labor interests. White welcoming,
as we should, those who seek our shoros to
merge themselves in our body politics and win
per- onal competenes by honest effort, we can
not regard such assemblages as distinctively
alien laborers, hired out in the mass to the
profit of alien speculators and shipped hither
and thither as the prospart of gain may die
, tate, as otherwiss than repugnant to the right
of our civilization deterrent to individual advancement
and hindrances to the building up
of stable communities resting upon the whole
some ambitions of the citizen and constituting
the prime factor in the prosperity and progress
of our nation. If legislation can reach
growing evil it certainly should be attempted this.

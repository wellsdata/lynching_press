PEOPLE DISCUSS THE LYNCHING
General Feeling That Too Many Mur
ders Have Gone Unpunished.
News of the lynching of Murderer
Higgins near Bancroft was given to
northern Nebraska and southern South
Dakota by The News just twenty- four
ahead of any other newspaper. The
story of the hanging was the principal
topic of conversation on the streets
of Norfolk during the afternoon and
the" Trust Busters,'' farce comedy
troupe, who arrived on the train from
Emerson, were in demand because of
the details which they were able to
give.
Higgins was being taken from Oma
ha to Pender for trial. Bancroft is a
town of 1,000 population and the first
station south of Pender. Bancroft is
in Cuming county. It is said that the
mob of men forced the engineer to
uncouple his locomotive from the
train while they went into the car and
took Higgins. The Omaha sheriff
moved for his gun but one of the mob
from behind grabbed his arms and the
gun was taken. The mob carried guns
and knives.
Among people generally who heard
of the lynching soon after it happened,
there was little tendency to condemn
the mob as severely as in many in
stances of this sort. There seemed to
be a general feeling that too many
murderers have been going unpunished
and that human life has been recently
regarded too cheaply in Nebraska
. Many referred to the case of
Frank Brink, murderer of Bessie New
ton at Ponca, who escaped with
months in the Norfolk hospital. three

BY HIS OWN PEOPLE.
NEGRO MURDERER LYNCHED
IN KENTUCKY.
Dragged from the Jail at Springfield
and Strung Up- Doors of the Structure
Battered Down and the Prisoner
Taken.
Springfield, Ky., Aug. 26. Shortly
after 2 o'clock this morning a mob,
composed of about a dozen men, took
Harrison Lewis, the negro who last
Friday night murdered Joe Brooks, also
colored, from the jail here and hanged
him to a tree in the court house yard.
When the mob reached the jail they
called for Jailer Smith, but his wife
informed them that he was not at
home and that he had the keys to the
jail with him. This did not daunt the
mob, however. Going to a blacksmith
shop near by, the men procured some
sledge hammers and, after three hours'
work, succeeded in battering down the
jail door. Lewis was found crouching
in his cell and begged piteously for his
life, but the leader ordered the men to
make quick work of him. He was
quickly seized and, after placing a rope
around his neck, was dragged to the
nearest tree and strung up without
further ceremony. The mob did its
work in a quiet, orderly way and
seemed to be thoroughly organized. It
is the opinion of many that it was com
posed of colored men. After completing
the work the mob quietly dispersed.
The murder was a dastardly one and
the negroes have been greatly worked
up since its occurrence. Friday night
Lewis went to Brooks' house and, call
ing him to the door, shot him down on
own threshold without any warn
ing his.

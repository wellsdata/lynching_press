LYNCH LAW IN TEXAS.
The Western Texan, of the 19th ult., has a communication
from a New Braunfels correspondent, which
gives the following exciting particulars of a recent resort
to lynch law in that city. We make the following ex
tract from the letter, which is dated June 7th:
An incident of rather a singularly serious character
took place here on the 3rd inst. A German of the
and sur
rounding counties as an old offender, was shot dead
while bound in irons, and in confinement in our court
house. As customary, this Wersdoerfer was conspicuous
in the suits tried at our last district court, and more
particularly in a suit brought against him by the State
for stealing horses on the Cibole, the property of Mr.
Perryman. His guilt seemed to have been clearly proved,
but from reasons not easily to be defined, two of the jurors
disapproved of awarding any punishment. The
consequence was, that the old offender, depredator and
thief, was allowed once more to prowl at large, to the
infinite danger of the community and the indignation of
every well- ineaning citizen.
As was to have been foreseen by every thinking mind,
from the unpunished catalogue of crimes which this
man has committed his offences would not stop here.
He made an attack, for some trifling cause, upon an un
protected woman, in the absence of her husband, with
a pistol loaded with cut bar lead, and discharged tho
contents, which took effect in the head and upper part
of the body. This done he absconded. This took
place on the 2d instant, about a mile from town. His
own dwelling is about twelve miles distant, in the
ta Clara settlement. San

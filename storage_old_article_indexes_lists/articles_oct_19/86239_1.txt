MOB VIOLENCE.
Several days ago two negroes who had
been convicted of murder were lynched in
Bullock county, and the AGE- HERALD
severely condemned the lawless act at the
time. A similar outbreak of the mob
spirit has just taken place near Memphis.
Six negroes charged with barn burning
were riddled with bullets. The lawless
spirit which finds its vent in a lynching
seems on the increase instead of decrease.
It is the great danger which threatens our
institutions. There is no limit to the excess
of the mob spirit when it once breaks
loose. The innocent is as apt to suffer as
the guilty. It may be directed toward
wealth, instead of toward crime.
Already have we seen in this country a
display of animosity toward corporations
and toward rich men and for no other
reason than because, of their wealth.

THREE NEGROES LYNCHED.
Mob Seizes Alleged Slayers on Way
From Court to Jail.
CHATTANOOGA, Tenn .. Feb. 19.- David
Neill, David Bomar and Watt Greer, negroes
charged with killing Special Officer
S. W. Everson of the Nashville, Chatta-
nooga and St. Louis Railroad and throwing
his body from the train at Bell Buckle
ten days ago, were taken from officers
in the court house at Shelbyville by a
mob to- day and beaten to death with sandbags
and clubs. Their bodies were then
riddled with bullets.
The lynching took place just after their
attorney, W. S. Crowell, had waived examination
to the Circuit Court. The officers
were the negroes to when
by what appeared to be a prearranged
plan the mob moved upon the men
seized them. and

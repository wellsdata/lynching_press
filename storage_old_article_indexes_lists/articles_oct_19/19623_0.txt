Boycott Tom Mix
OF ALL THE SHORTSIGHTED
and fatuous asses who have
sent messages of congratulations
to Governor Rolph of California
praising his approval of lynch-
ing, Tom Mix, the Western
ture star, is the biggest fool.
Most adulis regard Western or
cowboy pictures as" bunk" be
cause they are so unreal and far
fetched and represent a period
when this country was in its infancy
. How many times on the
screen have we not seen Tom
Mix as an innocent man on the
verge of being lynched by a how-
ling mob until some screen miracle
rescues him? Either Mix is
a true type of the villanous characters
he plays with or his mind
has been sadly warped by his
work in the films. It matters
not what has made him the ass
he proves to be, Negro theatre-
goers should boycott all Tom
Mix pictures. Stay away from
theatres where Tom Mix pictures
are showing. Don't help enrich
an advocate of lynching such as
Mix. Let us teach him and
Tom all like him a lesson.

| The Origin of" Lynch Law."
New York Herald.
It may be interesting to recall
in connection with the lynching
near Eaton, the of
term" lynch law." One tradi-
tion traces it to a
named Lynch, who tried a thief
whom he had caught to a tree
and flogged him with his own
hands. Another account says that
" in 1687-88 one Lynch was sent to
America to suppreess piracy, but
as the laws were not adminstered
with much vigor in the colonies,
owing to the difficulty of adhering
to the usual forms of law in
the newly established territories,
it is presumed that this Judge
Lynch was empowered to proceed
summarily against pirates, and
this gave rise to the term." It
can, however, be traced to a much
earlier date in Ireland, where it
has been so recently revived under
the most euphonious title of
" Boycotting." Toward the close of
the fifteenth century, James Fitz
stephen Lynch, Mayor of Galway,
presided at the trial of his own
son for willful robbery and mur
der, and, finding that the sentence
of death which he passed upon
him would not be executed, he
hanged hinself out of an upper
window" to make a good
to posterity." example

Was an Innocent Man Lynched?
The body of Dick Drummond, the man
who was lynched, was brought to Knox
ville today. It now looks like an innocent
man was lynched at Briceville yesterday
morning if the statements of W. R. Lan
drum, Mrs. Landrum and a man. named
Landrum's wife positively
Peek, are true.
swears that Drummond, the man who was
lynched and who boards at her house, was
in his room from S o'clock of the night
Laughtey was murdered until breakfast
time the next morning. Peek, who is also
a boarder in the house, is positive of the
same thing, and Landrum, while not being
to swear to this, thinks that all the
able circumstances point to that fact.

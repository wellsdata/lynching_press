CONFESSED AND WAS LYNCHED.
Henry Phillips, a Mississippi County Murderer
, Pays the Penalty With His Life.
Henry Phillips, a negro murderer, was
taken from the jail at Osceola by a
mob and lynched, the hanging taking
place shortly after midnight in the public
square. The crime for which Phillips
paid the penalty with his life was a
most cold- blood one. On the night of
November 6 the store of Thomas Mc
Clanahan, at Butler's Landing, was entered
and robbed, and McClanahan, who
slept in the building, murdered, his
body being literally hacked to pieces
with an axe. Phillips, who was seen
in the vicinity on the evening before
the murder was committed, fled to Memphis
, and he was suspected of the crime.
He was soon located and arrested, when
he made a frll confession to the Memphis
police, implicating another negro
named Vincent. Upon being turned
over to the sheriff of Mississippi county
by the Memphis authorities, Phillips
bade his child and the woman who had
accompanied him to Memphis farewell,
saying that he knew he would be
lynched. The mob that took the law
into their own hands numbered in the
neighborhood of 100 men, and were
mounted, riding to the jail four abreast.
The sheriff was compelled at the muzzle
of a shot- gun to surrender the keys.
Phillips and his alleged partner in the
crime were seized and placed in a
bugzy, and the crowd marched to the
place of execution. A citizen made a
plea to the mob to spare Vincent, as
there was some doubt of his guilt, and
none of the stolen plunder was found in
his possession. Vincent was then re
turned to the jail. Phillips made
statement, confessing his guilt. and
requested the mob not to shoot him
after hanging him. Phillips was told
that his last request would be granted
and after swinging him to the limb
a tree the mob dispersed. of

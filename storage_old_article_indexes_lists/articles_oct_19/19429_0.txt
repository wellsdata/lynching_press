LYNCHING CERTAIN IF MAN IS
Slayer of His Daughter, is Trailed
with Bloodhounds- Girl
to Have Been Murdered. Believed
bloodhounds are searching for a negro,
who will be lynched if caught. The man
made away with Anna Kaiser, a 17- year
old girl, after beating her father almost
to death. It is believed the girl was assaulted
and murdered. Farmers from far
and near have joined in the chase and it
seems impossible that the fugitive can
escape so many are seeking him.
The, attack took place as Miss Kaiser
and her father, Martin Kaiser, a farmer,
were returning from services at the Ro
man Catholic Church at Yorkvillo to
their home near Manchester. The negro
waylaid the two and the father was beaten
over the head with a club until he be
came unconscious. Then the girl, was
carried off, supposedly to the woods near
by. From that time her fate is shrouded
in mystery. 2017
did not regain consciousness un
til Kaiser morning, when he was found by the
til morning, when he was found by the
side of the road. He was roused sufficiently
to tell his story and give a description
of his assailant. As ho is 70 years
of age it is feared he cannot survive his
injuries and the exposure.
The theory of the authorities is
the negro, after assaulting Miss Kaiser that,
negro, after assaulting
threw her into Tanner's Creek near by,
as her hat was found oating in the
creek, and her umbrella was found on
the bank of the stream not far from the
spot where the two were attacked.
There no argument regarding the
fate of the is black man when arrested.
The people are determined and they will
not wait for the law to act on the case.
Practically all work was abandoned and
farmers and townspeople armed them
selves and spread in all directions.

STANLEY GIVES IT UP.
Thinks the Leavenworth, Kan., Lynch
ers Conld Not Be Convicted.
Gov. Stanley of Kansas has revised his
declaration to immediately offer a reward
for the apprehension and conviction of
any of the persons assisting in the burn-
ing at the stake of Fred Alexander, the
negro, at Leavenworth. The Governor
had decided that he would offer the re
ward, but deliberation on the subject induced
him to change his mind." It would
be of absolutely no use to issue the offer,"
said the Governor." If the guilty persons
were arrested they would necessarily
have to undergo the first trial in Leav
enworth County, and on account of the
present condition of public sentiment it
would be absolutely useless to attempt to
prosecute anybody there for the crime."
The sentiment of the Kansas Legislature
on the Leavenworth mob was reflected in
Chaplain Morehead's prayer:" We realize
we have been disgraced in the eyes
of the world by the work of a mob. Save
us from lawlessness and make us law
abiding citizens." Within an hour after
convening a joint resolution, introduced
by Senator Carpenter, was passed by
houses, denouncing the Leavenworth
both mob.

THEONLY WAY?
( Philadelphia, Pa., Press)
The South in general and Kentucky
in particular should be grateful for
Governor Morrow's firmly courageous
action. In using the militia to disperse
an armed mob bent on lynchingize
a Negro prisoner he has struck a blow
at lynch law which will long be re-
membered and which should have a
salutary effect in effacing it altogether
. The South needs more executives
of his stamp of conscientiousness and
fearlessness.
That five people had to be killed
while he was thus preserving law and
order is deplorable. But there will be
no disposition to blame Gov. Morrow
for this. The mot which sought to
override lawful authority brought
these casualties on itself, and it is
fortunate that more of its members
did not fall before the rifles of the
defenders of the government.
Lynching is an abomination peculiar
to America. It is an evil tradition
which has operated to stain the good
repute of an otherwise law- abiding
people. Gov. Morrow's way is the
only effective way. The nation owes
him gratitude for the example he
set. has

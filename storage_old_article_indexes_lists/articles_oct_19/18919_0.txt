4. Christ's Self- defense and Escape.
Jesus comparing himself with the Prophet
Isaiah practically called his hearers
, poor
,
brokenhearted, captives, blind, slaves. They
in return practically asked," Who are you? If
some great one, let us see what you can do. We
have heard of your miracles elsewhere; give us
a specimen." But miracles are for spiritual
benefit, and not for the gratification of mere
whim or curiosity. Elijah and Elisha were
particular in performing miracles to know
whether they would be profitable. Seemingly,
Jesus magnified Gentiles. Hebrew pride could
not brook such partiality. The Jews raged.
They became a mob. They illustrated lynch
law. They were bent on murder, for to slay
without legal authority is a violation of the
sixth commandment. They showed themselves
utterly unworthy of any divine favors. Dr.
Hackett says:" The present Nazareth lies
along the hill- side, but much nearer the base
than the summit. A precipice- almost perpendicular
, 40 or 50 feet high- is found still just
above the modern village, over which it is
hardly possible that a person should fall with
out being killed instantly."
He escaped. He knew every byway. His
manner was awing. His time had not
come. yet

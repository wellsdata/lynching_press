The Innocent Rapist
and
The Georgia Burning.
There is just now considerable clicking

the burning of the negro Joe Washington,
near Savannah, Ga.,

opinion, North or South. But such is not
the case, and in judging of results one
must ever keep his eye upon the cause;
and while remembering the punishment,

The deed was the most heinous known
and the negro was positively identified by
his victim- these sealed
circumstances

it, from the standpoint of pity for
the criminal, what the method? Be it by
halter, bullet, knife or brand, the result's
the same.

existence, and if he be brought to trial
tell her shame before a listening world in
a crowded court.

recent events in this State:
A negro outrages a respectable white
woman in Cumberland county. He is
positively identified by her. There are
other corroborating circumstances and
he is convicted and sentenced. Then

until the judiciary is exhausted; then
the executive vein is struck and work

to a judge who, to save the negro, over

That is one side of the picture; now
look upon the other.
While all this sentiment has been
slopping over Council, what has been
happening? In Greene and Wayne
counties negroes arrested- for attempts
to assault white women. In Chatham
and Durham counties negroes arrested
found by white women in their rooms
at night. In Lenoir and Johnston counties
, negroes lynched- for rape of white
women. In Mecklenburg county, a
married woman and a little girl, both
white, outraged by negroes.
This is the awful record of the last
few months. Has it any connection
with the dilly- dallying in the Council
case?
Let justice be done but let it be done
quickly. Is there delay," they get the
news," and there is no estimating its
effect on their conduct. Is there a
burning or a lynching," they also get
the news" and in the stark, swinging
body or in the flare and glare of the
flames each miscreant reads his fate.
Such incidents prevent not one, but
many outrages of a similar kind, sav
ing the honor and life of more than
one pure woman who would otherwise
go shame- lashed and sorrow- haunted
to her grave.

If you see it in the Sun it's not always
so; it may be a joke. The New York
Sun recently view

Mrs. Melusina Fay Pierce, of New York
city, took up the gauntlet in behalf of
her sex, and incidentally of the South.
In a letter printed in the Sun on July
9th Mrs. Pierce used this language con.
cerning the Southern lynching of negroes
accused of assault on women:
" For my part, I thank God every
time I read that Southern manhood has

blush for the decadent Europeanism of
the Northern press and pulpit which insists
that these revolting tragedies
must be settled in court, and I despise
as the most utter cowards and traitors
in the country the Southern Governors
and sheriffs who, to win the approval
of this decadent Northern manhood,
shoot down the avengers who are trying
to uphold the standards of the white
American race. If Southern womanhood
had the proper spirit in this matter
it would hold mass meetings and
boycott the families of such Governors
and sheriffs until they were compelled
to move to the North."
Having given expression to these vigorous
sentiments Mrs. Peirce stood pat,
and the Sun drawing in its claws crept
away into more pleasant fields of com
ment.

Mrs. Peirce's name:

gave a helping hand in the glorious
work of vengeance.
" But there was one feature wanting,
or at least not mentioned, and unpleasant
as it may be to give prominence
to it, yet justice and retribution demand
the preliminary mutilation of
these beasts in a way that brands into
the public mind the awful fiendish, devilish
character of the crime which they
are inadequately expiating by being
burned at the stake.
" Let me that in future executions
by burning hope there will be no un
certainty as to poetic as well as inexorable
justice."
This last letter, it seems, was a forgery
, for Mrs. Fay wrote the Sun next
day and demanded an apology and re
traction, saying:
" I am shocked beyond expression at
finding in The Sun of this morning a
letter over my signature containing
sentiments so brutal and suggestions so
gross as to be by me or any other reputable
woman not only unwritable to a
public print, but almost unthinkable."
The Sun apologizes editorially and
thinks the" purpose of the forger, who
would probably call himself or herself
a practical joker merely, was evidently
to reduce to an absurdity the
argument
of Mrs. Peirce in a genuine letter
from her printed by us on the 9th of last
month; but it was an infamous proceed
ing and we are outraged that this pa
per was used to, abet it."
Mrs. Peirce adds in her letter that
she is preparing a careful statement of
her" exact position on this terrible
question of assault and its penalty."
If one may judge by the samples torn
off for us in her July 9th communication
and her more recent demand for an
apology from the Sun, Mrs.
" exact position" will be spicy reading Peirce's.

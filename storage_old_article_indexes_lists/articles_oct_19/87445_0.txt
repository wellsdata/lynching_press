TOMPKINSVILLE, Ky., Oct. 24.- News
has reached here of the lynching of
Arch Baur, colored, who committed an
assaulton and attempted to murder Annie
Morrison, oldest daughter of Hen
ry Morrison, a prominent farmer of
Cumberland county.
The crime was committed at the Morrison
home Friday afternoon about
o'clock.
The members of Morrison house
hold were visiting in the the neighborhood,
except the eldest daughter, who remained
at home to care for the house.
Baur, unnoticed, went direct to Mor
rison's home.
Miss Morrison screamed for help
when he entered, but no one was near
enough to hear her, though the house
was close to one of the most frequent-
ed public roads.
She fought the fiend with desperation
, but the Negro drew a piece of
sharp iron, striking her two or three
blows on the head and inflicted wounds
that may prove fatal. He fled, believ-
ing his victim dead.
When the neighbors learned of the
horrible affair they formed a mob and
pursued the Negro with bloodhounds.
They trailed him to a small cabin
within five miles of where the crime
was committed.
The door was quickly broken down.
The Negro hearing the noise, tried to
make his escape through a window,
but failed.
When they entered he begged for
mercy, but a noosed rope was quickly
thrown over his head and about his neck
and he was dragged, more dead than
alive, to the woods, where the rope
was tossed over the limb of a tree he
was hauled into the air, and the life re.
maining soon passed out of his body.
The lynchers left the body and disappeared
. Eight bullet holes were found
in the body Saturday morning. The
remains were buried by Baur's
tives. rela

Forty years ago there were whole Chris
tian streets and suburbs on the north side
of Damascus, but in 1860, the Druses, a
tribe of savage mountaineers, entered the
city and killed five thousand Christians,
after destroying at least an equal number
of houses. Strange to say, these Druses
profess a religion which includes many
doctrines of our bible, and they are incessantly
at war with the lurks, but they hate
the Christians still more for refusing to
conform to their own creed altogether.
After plundering Damascus they prepared
to march against the large seaport town
of Beyrout, and were joined by such a mob
of adventurers that the Turks were unable
to guarantee the safety of any city in Syria,
and a number of European powers had to
combine before the fanatics could be indue-
ed to return to their mountains. When
they did return they agreed to keep the
peace for seventy years, and many survivors
of the frightful massacre have since
returned to Damascus, which has once
more become most flourishing of all the
cities of western the Asia. -Felix L. Oswald.

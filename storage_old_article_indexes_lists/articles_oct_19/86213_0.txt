Lynebing of Two Negroes.
[ From the Evansville Journal, August 1.]
The two negro brutes, who so flendishly
maltreated a white woman on Sunday, fear
fully expiated their crime yesterday after
noon. dol bloe
Early yesterday morning a crowd of ex
cited people commenced collecting around
the court- house and jail, demanding that
up to them.
The demand was refused, of course, and at
noon the crowd dispersed, and it was hoped
that better counsels would prevail, and that
the guilty wretches would be left to the due
course of the law.
But, after noon, the crowd assembled
again, and the excitement had evidently
increased, and continued to increase until
about 3 o'clock, when the front door of
the jait bailding was broken open with a
sledge hammer, and the crowd rushed into
the jail. How they reached the prisoners
we did not learn, but they were soon drag
ged fo th into the street, beaten down with
clubs and shot. 10.
After they were dead, they were taken
up and hanged to a lamp post on the cor
ner they were
a late hour, in the evening. They were,
ultimately, we learn, taken down and
buried.
It was the first scene of the kind ever
enacted in Evansville, and, for the fair
fame of the city, we hope it will be the
last.
TRANICA
Every one execrates the abominable and
brutal crime committed by the negroes,
but mob law is a dangerous remedy for
stevils of this or any kind, and all good citizens
deplore to resort to it; and we hope
this fearful and summary punishment will
prove such a warning that we never
again hear of such a crime in our shall midst.

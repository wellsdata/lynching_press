seven negroes implicated
murder. The trial was not ended
and the parties were put under
guard at Saddlersville last night.
This morning at 1 o'clock a masked
party of fifty men were seen half a
mile from Saddlersville armed with
shot- guns and holding consultation,
Seventy men were seen passing here
at 12 o'clock, going toward Saddlers
ville, and no doubt they will
the seven negroes before morn
lynch ing.

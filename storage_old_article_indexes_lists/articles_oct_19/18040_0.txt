The Morning Advertiser says" negroes
are shot, hanged and burned for crimes
without form of law" in the south. It is
true that negroes have been lynched for
terrible crimes in the south, and one was
burned in Texas, but the southern people
do not approve of lynch law. Do the people
of New York approve of lynching
negroes because a mob lynched a negro in
an interior town of New York some months
ago? And how long has it been since a
negro was shot death in Indiana by a
mob for a crime to of some sort?

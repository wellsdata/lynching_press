THE PRESS AND THE LAWYER.
While admitting that there has been
gross carelessness and inexcusable stupidity
on the part of some of the news
papers of the state and particularly of
one or two local reporters on the daily
papere, in giving the alleged news concerning
the proceedings of the courts
in important criminal cases, Editor
Chaplin of the Laramie Republican
does not entirely agree with the opinion
of Attorney General Van Orsdel
that the newspapers of the state are
wholly to blame for the state of public
sentiment which has resulted in three
lynchings of murderers by Wyoming
mobs within the year.
Editor Chaplin says:" It is not
probable a single one of the lynchings
was caused by a newspaper error.
Such acts can generally be traced to
personal interest on the part of the
leaders of the mob, or the uncontrolla
desire for vengeance while the public
mind is inflamed. Misinformation
may exert some influence in aid of de-
aigning men, or it may aid in inciting
to riot and bloodshed, but there is lit-
tle evidence to show that this was the
case in the lynchings uppermost in the
public mind.
" The law's delav has become a pro
verb. It is true that the machinery
of our courts is cumbersome and to
men with money and influence great
delays are possible, but it oannot be
charged that this was the case in either
of the lynchings mentioned by General
Van Oradel. Indeed, it cannot be
charged that Wyoming courts have
been derelict in the performance of
their business in any important matters
. They have simply carried out
the mandates of the laws made by the
legislatures.
" Newspaper men are no better and
no worse than the men of other call
ings. They are prone to err the same
as the lawyers. What we need is a
building up of public sentiment all
along the line. Let it be fully under
stood by all the people that the majesty
of the law must be upheld, that
lynching is murder and that no man
can go conscience free who has the
blood of another upon his hauds,
whether the act is performed in com
pauy with others or single- handed."
It is easy for weak humanity to point
out the mote in our brother's eye, entirely
overlookfng the beam that ob
ecures our own vision, and Editor Chap
lin proceeds to take this fall out of the
legal profession:
" In conclusion General Van Orsdel
says:' Let the newspapers, in their
reports of judicial proceedings, exercise
more care.' He might well have
added:' And let the lawyere, in the
practice of their profession, hew strict
ly to the line of honesty, fairness and
the true ethics of their high and honorable
calling.'
" It is a well known fact that most
lawyers will take a case whether their
client is right or wrong and that they
will present arguments to court and
jury which they know to be fallacious
from one end to the other. They ex
cuse themselves for doing this by saying
that they have a professional opinion
and private opinion; that their
clients have the right to have their
side of the case presented in the strong-
est way possible, whether right or
wrong, and that the burden is upon the
court and the jury to sift out the truth.
Some lawyers hold that it is their
right to sell their professional services
to any cause pending before a legisla-
ture and that it is perfectly right for
them to appear for hire as lobbyists,
urging with all their power of argument
, business association and personal
friendship measures which they know
to be vicious and contrary to the public
weal. Under such circumstances it
is impossible for the public to tell
whether they are in earneet as individuals
, or simply the hired men of interested
parties."
If a newspaper should sell its professional
opinion and influence without
regard to the justice or infamy of the
cause espoused, to the one holding out
the biggest retainer, it would be en
ternally damned and ostracised by the
general public, and justly so.
We fail to understand the code of
moral ethics that justifies conduct on
the part of one part of one profession
that is considered a high crime against
public morality when practiced by
another.
" Meanwhile," says Mr. Chaplin,
" let both the lawyers and newspaper
men take General Van Orsdel's
and rise to a higher standard." advice

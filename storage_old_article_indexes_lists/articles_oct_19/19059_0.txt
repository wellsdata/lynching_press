NEW YORK- Senator C. C. Dill
of Washington, was leaving the
Salem Baptist Church in Harlem
yesterday evening when he was
approached by a Scottsboro Defense
collector. The senator had
just addressed an audience of
Negro workers, calling upon them
to support his bill, which is aimed
at splitting the ranks of the work

and Japanese workers, who
like the Negroes are lynched and
oppressed, shall be ousted from any
jobs" heretofore held by Negroes."

with the plight of the Negro mass

the appeal of the collector. He
reached into his pockets and pull
ed out his change. Carefully sort
ing the handful, he dropped his
" bit" for the Scottsboro Boys
the box- a nickel! into

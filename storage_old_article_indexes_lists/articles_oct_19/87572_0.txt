HOAX. The papers were filled last week with
a terrible account of riot and murders committed
sear Georgetown, Ohio, in consequence of an at
tempt by certain Kentuckiane to capture their run
away slaves. The story was that the Kentucki-
ans were resisted by the Abolitionists in the neighborhood
, and that several lives were lost in the ri-
ot, and a negro lynched by hanging. The whole
turns out to be a lying hoax, gotten up by some
mischievous creature, who doubtless has had much
enjoyment in the excitement which his
bas produced. statement

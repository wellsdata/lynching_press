GRATITUDE.
MOTHER'S
Mrs. Frost Satisfied None Others
Can Suffer from Negro's Crime.
Denver:" Well, no other parents will
suffer from that brute's crime." These
were the words of Mrs. Frost when asked
for an expression on the punishment of the
who confessed that he was the mur-
derer of her child.
" Of course I was not consulted as to the
punishment to be meted out, and I did not
know what fate awaited him," she continued
." I did not care, just so he was re
moved from the face of the earth. Nothing
can atone for the death of my baby, and I
did not have the
feeling of revenge which
so many people said ought to possess me.
My one thought was to save others my
fate. The punishment of the brute was
right, no matter what. Certainly he did
not suffer what Louise did; she was innocent
, while he was guilty. Maybe I would
have some pity were I not her mother. No
one but a parent of an outraged and
dered child can know just how I feel. mur"
The murdered
child's father, Robert
Frost, returned to Denver from the scene
of the lynching.
" A great load has been lifted off us,"
said he," and as for me I don't care who
condemns mo for starting the blaze. No
other father will have to do what I did on
account of that nigger, and as I said be
fore, if the brute had been lynched for his
first offense in Kansas, my baby would be
alive today and our hearts would not
broken." be

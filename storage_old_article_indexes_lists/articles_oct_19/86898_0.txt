MAN LYNCHED IN
ORDERLY MANNER
Victim of Mob Was Son of a
Prominent Farmer
HIS PRAYERS UNHEEDED
Young Man Was Charged With the
Shooting of Clyde King in Luxora,
Arkansas, on the Night of
March 31,
Osceola, Ark., April 6.- May Hearn of
Luxora, Ark., was taken from the county
jail here this morning, between the
hours of 1 and 2 o'clock, and lynched.
The victim of the mob was a young
white man, the son of J. R. Hearn, one
of the most respected farmers living in
the neighborhood of Luxora, and the
crime for which he was hanged was the
shooting of Clyde King of Luxora on the
night of Sunday, March 31.
The lynching was a very quiet affair,
as the mob that participated in it was
thoroughly organized .It seemed to be
made up largely of persons from Luxora,
as the members entered Osceola horse
back, and not over half a dozen citizens
of the place were aware that a lynching
had taken place until this morning.
The mob, numbering about fifteen per
sons, entered the city about midnight.
Sentries were posted along Main street
and a posse was sent out to effect the
captur of Deputy Sheriff Lee Goodrich
and Night Watchman Skipworth. Both of
the officers were found by the posse, and
after their capture they were disarmed
and compelled to accompany the lynch
ers.
Deputy Sheriff Goodrich had the key to
the jail in his pockets, and these were
taken of by the leaders of the
mob. Arriving at the Jall, the lynchers
made an entrance.
Hearn fell upon his knees and began to
pray. Although his sentences were almost
incoherent, he insisted that he had not
killed King from malice, but that the
shooting was accidental.
The mob was unmoved by his prayers
for mercy, and placing a rope around his
neck, they took him from the jail and
hanged him to a tree.
After it was found that Hearn was dead
the mob, in an organized body, left the
scene of the tragedy and rode out of
town.
The body was left dangling in the air
until about 9 o'clock this morning, when
it was cut down and turned over to
family. his

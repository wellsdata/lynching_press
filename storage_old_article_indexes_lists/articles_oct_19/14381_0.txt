MILITIA IS
IN CONTROL
NEGRO PRISONER CAIRO MOB
WANTED IS GIVEN A 14- YEAR
SENTENCE IN PEN.
Indictment and Sentence Took Less
Than an Hour of the Court's
Time When It Was Brought
Up for Trial.
Cairo, II., Feb. 18.- With three
companies of militia guarding the
court house and jail, under direct supervision
of Adjutant General Frank
S. Dickson, of Springfield, Ill., this city
settled down tonight to complete quiet
after a strenuous twenty- four hours,
and the authorities believe they have
the situation well in hand.
There are may scattered groups of
men about the streets and in the vi
inity of the jail but no crowd is al-
lowed to congregate.
Threats have been made against
Sheriff Fred D. Nellis for the killing
Alexander Halliday early
this
morning by his deputies and the
wounding of four others in battling
back the mob that attempted to lynch
a negro purse, but presence
of the soldiers is snatcher having a satisfactiry
effect in preventing further demonstrations
.
A third company was asked by the
sheriff this afternoon and Company
M, of Champaign, 111., was ordered out
and arrived here at 6:30 o'clock.
John Pratt, the negro, the mob in
tended to lynch and who was given
an indeterminate sentence of not more
than fourteen years in the Chester
penitentiary on each of two charges of
robbery this afternoon, will be taken
secretly to the prison at 5 o'clock to
morrow with twelve other convicted
special train. His re
prisoners.in a
moval, it is belfeved, will remove the
last apprehension of another assault
on the jail.
Lincoln Wilson, arrested as a sus
j
pected companion of Pratt, was re
leased tonight. The grand jury fail
to return an indictment against
him.
Pratt's indictment and sentence took
less than a half hour this afternoon.
At 3 o'clock the indictment was re
turned and ten minutes later he plead
ed guilty and was sentenced by Circuit
Judge William Butler.
A searching investigation of the at-
tack on the jail this morning when
Halliday was killed was ordered this
afternoon by Judge Butler in a charge
to the grand jury immediately after
the disposal of the cases of the two
negroes. No action was taken this af-
ternoon but the affair will be taken
up when the jury reconvenes tomorrow
.
Judge Butler's instructions to the
jury were in substance a de
grand mand that the dioters be brought to
give up Pratt," he said tonight," when
some one fired a shot in the crowd.
" My deputies, watching the parley
from a second story window, thought
I fired a shot as a signal. They then
fired a volicy into the air.
" The mob refused to retreat and my
deputies then fired into the crowd.
You know the result. My conscience
is easy over the entire affair. They
were determined to get me unless I
go them. I did my duty by protect
ing my prisoners at any price."
Former Sheriff Frank Davis, who
was ousted from office by Governor
Deneen after the lynching of William
James, a negro, and Henry Salzuer,
a white man, last November, is suing
to oust Nellis from the office, claim
ing the law under which he was oust
ed is unconstitutional.
" I may have paid a pretty good
price to hold a job I may lose in the
courts," said Nellis tonight.
A dozen token windows in the
courthouse teday showed the resu't
of the shots fred into the building by
the mob, but no serious damage was
done.
Sheriff Nellis received a slight
flesh wound in the hand. All the
party with him in the jail escaped
injury.
There were six negroes in the party
of fourteen armed deputies that defended
the jail with Nellis, he says.
His party numbered about 2, but
there were not guns enough and the
negroes were immediately pressed ined
to service, he says, because he could
not get enough white men to serve.
Despite this explanation, he is be
ing criticised for deputizing negroes
to fire on whites and the maleontents
are using the as an argument
for further demonstrations incident.
The conflict between the city and
county authorities that marked the
November lynchings is again in evidence
. Mayor Parsons says he was
not notified of any trouble until 2
o'clock and that he then ordered the
police department to go to the assist.
ance of the sheriff.
Captain Greaney of Company K, the
local militia company, that was order
ed out at 10 o'clock last night by
Governor Deneen, had not reported
until 2 o'clock, said he did not receive
the governor's orders until 2 o'clock.
Mayor Parsons has ordered the sa- l
loons to remain closed until danger
of further disturbance has passed.
The Halliday family said tonight
they had retained an attorney to sue
the sheriff and the county for damages
. Halliday who was a son of
former Mayor T. W. Halliday, was
shot through the neck and lay on the
ground near the court house porch
nearly three hours before Nellis would
permit militiamen to remove him to a
hospital.
He died two hours later.
Nellis replies to criticisms of his refusal
to permit the injured man to be
removed by saying he obeyed orders|
from Governor Deneen to permit no}
person near the building. Samuel
Wessinger, is the only one of the injured
whese condition is at all ser
ious.
He is at St. Mary's Infirmary
with eleven buckshot wounds in his
head.
George B. Walker, correspondent
for the Associated Press, was
shot in the leg while watching who the af
fair, had five holes shot through his
clothes.
John Pearl, a street car conductor,
was pulled off the car on which he
was working tonight by militiamen
after he called one of them, it is alleged
, an insulting name. He was
lodged in jail on a charge of disorderly
conduct.
The Commercial club and the
Chamber of Commerce tonight at a
joint meeting issued a proclamation
decrying the recent acts of mob violence
and urging the citizens to rally
to the support of their civil officials.
An investigation by state militia officers
as to the delay of Company K.
of Cairo, in reporting for duty is possible
, although Adjutant General Dick
son said he had not time to look into
the matter. Captain Greaney said it
required two hours to get his com-
together, because of the snow,
pany drifts in the streets.

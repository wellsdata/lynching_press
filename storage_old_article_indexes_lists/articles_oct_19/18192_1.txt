TEXAN LYNCH LAW .-- A man named Ains
worth, charged with murder, was recently placed
in jail in De Witt county, Texas. A few nights
after a gang of men proceeded to the prison, and
broke open a door which seems to have been in
the top of the cell. Through this they dropped
an ignited turpentine ball, by the light of which
they could plainly see the situation of the prison
er. They then deliberately murdered Ainsworth,
firing successively four different volleys of buck
shot until he was killed. The cries of the vic
tim for help, and his screams of pain, was dis
tinetly heard by persons close at hand, not one
whom however, would venture to his assis-
of tance.

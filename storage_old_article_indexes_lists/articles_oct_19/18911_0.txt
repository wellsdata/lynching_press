Santa Clara County grand jury indicted
no one for the lynching of two accused
kidnap- slayers of Brooke L. Hart.

said evidence presented was totally in
adequate to justify indictments against
any person." The resolution said, how
ever, the jury was ready to hear" any
definite" evidence which may be presented
in the future.

the jury's failure to indict did not mean
he will ask for dismissal of charges

mond November 26. Cataldi be given

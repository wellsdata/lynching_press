" I have never been to see the
sheriff because I don't feel that it
would do any good."
Feeling is running high here and
throughout Caldwell county over the
lynching. There is some fear that
the terrors of the old night riders
and the more recent Ku- Klux Klan
which had 1,000 members in Caldwell
county, again are imminent.
W. J. Miller, attorney, who fought
the Klan here at the height of its
power, places the present Klan
strength here at" an active 150
men."
That the lynching of Merrick was
well organized is indicated by the
fact that almost four
months
elapsed between the bombing and
the lynching. Excitement over the
bombing had subsided.
Witnesses said the" mob" was
composed of about twenty men who
took Merrick from jail just before
midnight, working silently and
. No disturbance prefaced
quickly the lynching.

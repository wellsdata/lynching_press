Patrolman Hall, of Topeka, who
broke the skull of George Head, is in
jail, as much for his own protection as
for a criminal
act.
Head was a joint-
ist and resisted arrest for disturbing a
religious meeting, when Hull struck
the fatal blow. A crowd of jointkeep-
ers and their friends have been
izing a mob to lynch Hall. organ

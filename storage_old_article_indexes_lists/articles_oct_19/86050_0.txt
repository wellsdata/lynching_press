GLEANINGS. SOUTHERN
Reminiscences of Ben Hill of Georgia.
A Southern correspondent relates the fol
lowing incidents in the career of the late
Senator Ben H. Hill: In 1855 Mr. Hill declared
himself a candidate for congress in the
Fourth Congressional District, and at an in
formal meeting of representatives the
of
Whig party, held in the town of Newman, his
candidacy was indorsed. In this campaign
Mr. Hill was in reality the candidate of the
American or" Knownothing" party, which
had just taken shape in Georgia. He was op.
posed by ex- Chief Justice Hiram Warner, of
Greenville, who ran as the nominee of the
Democratic party. The race was warm and
closely contested, Warner winning by the
trifling majority of 66 votes in a district which,
prior to that time, was accustomed to roll
up democratic majority of 2,500 votes. In
1856 Hill was placed on the electoral ticket
for Millard Fillmore. It was during this year
that his wonderful powers on the" hustings"
were first shown to the best advantage, he
having met and vanquished both Alexander
H. Stephens and Robert Toombs in debate
in the of
town Lexington, Oglethorpe
County. Toombs didn't care to fight him,
but Stephens was so incensed at the
new great man who had literally laid him out
on his own stamping ground that he forth
with challenged him. In reply Hill wrote that
celebrated note which is now a part of the
political history of the State. it was in these
words:" I will not fight you. I have a con
science and a You In
1858 Hill was retained to defend William A.
Choice, who killed the bailiff, Webb, at Atlanta
. The case is reported in 34 Georgia, and is
famous. Bill Choice, as he was called, was a
man education and talent,
belonging to one of the best families of Rome,
on a visit to Atlanta he got on a
spree, and while drinking with some friends
in the bar of the old Atlanta Hotel, which
then stood where the Kimball House now
stands, James Webb, the justice court bailiff,
handed him a notice showing that he had
that been he sued attempted for$ 10. to This punish so enraged Webb on Choice the
Early the following morning, fresh from the
night's debauch, Choice walked into Prior
street, and, seeing Webb standing on the opposite
side of the street, several hundred feet
away, taken de
liberate aim, shot him down without the slight-
est warning. The town was in an uproar in
a few minutes, and many of the best citizens
were so outraged at the act that they
declared for lynch law. Choice defied the of
who laid hands upon him. He was finally
captured by strategy and safely lodged in the
lock- up just before the howling mob, clamor
ous for his blood, reached the station- house.
Many able lawyers were engaged to defend
him, young Hill among the number. Public
opinion was against the prisoner. The de-
fo fense pleaded insanity, and after the longest
and most exeiting trial in the annals of Ful
ton County, the prisoner was convicted. Hill
had thrown his whole soul into the case, and
his those
days the pardoning power was vested in the
State Senate. Hill went back to Troup County

where he made his celebrated speech for the
pardon of Choice of this remarkable effort,

ever fell from human lips. Mrs. Choice, the

of young Hill, as, pale, slender, and thought
ful, he walked down the aisle. The galleries
and the excitement was
ered but intense. Hill spoke many hours.
His tongue seemed to drop manna,' for surely
such exquisite strains of pathos never fell up
on the air. The Senate was in tears. President

scribe upon the gallows in letters of blood,
that all time may the this is
Georgia's Lunatic Asylum.'" Choice was declared
insane by an overwhelming vote and
sent to the asylum. Hill was the ablest and
bitterest opponent in Georgia of the reconstruction
measures, and at the peril of expa
triation, delivered a speech of the boldest
and most fiery invective in Davies' Hall
at
Atlanta in 1866, in which he denounced the
United States authorities and flercely vi.
tuperated and defied the Nothern soldiery
, who, accompanied by their officers
, formed part of the audience. Toombs
Stephens, Jenkins, and other public men had
been asked to address the people on the
situation, but Hill alone had the audacity to
speak his sentiments in public. He continued
his opposition to reconstruction by writ
ing his" Notes on the Situation" -which are
regarded in the South as the finest philippics
since those of Demosthenes- and at a vast
meeting of the people of Georgia, held at At
Janta in 1868, he gave utterance to his celebrated
Bush Arbor invective, in which he not
only adyocated the social ostracism of Re
publicans in Georgia, ut advised their own
wives to leave them. Howell Cobb and Bob
Toombs spoke at the same time and place,
and at the conclusion of Hill's speech Toombs
arose in the presence of the vast crowd and
congratulated him, saying:" Sir, it was the
grandest effort I ever heard." Bullock fled the
State in 1871, and upon the coming into power
of the Democrats, in 1872, Hill, Gordon, and
Stephens offered for the Senate. Gordon was
elected. Upon the death of McMillan, of the
Ninth Congressional District, Hill, who lived
part of the time at Athens, in that district,
became a candidate for the nomination. The
convention broke up in a row, and Hill made
the race before the his
nent, Estes. His term having expired, he was
renominated and returned to Congress with
out opposition. In 1876, while still in Congress,
he antagonized Norwood for the United States
Senatorship. The people held meetings in
various parts of the State, urging the Legislature
to elect Hill, and he made a three hour
speech, advocating his claims in a masterly
manner, and then left for Washington. Nor
wood remained in Atlanta, buttonholing
the members. The galleries were crowd
ed during the three days' balloting,
and the populace were for Hill. Nor
wood held his own pretty well, but the
pressure was too great, and on the third day,
a Norwood man changed his vote to Hill, the
Norwood men stampeded, and enough votes
were changed to give Hill the prize. The Re
publicans and negroes in the Legislature voted
for Hill. It has often been said that in
oratory Cicero was Mr. Hill' model, and it is
known that of the great men of this country
his favorite was Henry Clay. Hill himself
gave the best definition of the true orator
( not excepting that of Demosthenes) the cor
respondent ever heard. He said:" The true
orator is he who has the intellect to see the
trath, the heart to feel it, and the courage to
speak it." How could a definition be more
finished in civil casive ar. Hill was dis
well as criminal law,
and received the largest fee ever paid to a
lawyer in Georgia in a single case. It was
$ 50,000, paid by Thomas Metcalf, one of the
wealthiest men of Augusta, in a cotton claim
case argued by Hill in the United States
at Savannah just after the war. Court

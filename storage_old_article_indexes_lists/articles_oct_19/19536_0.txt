IN RETALIATION FOR THE LYNCH
NEW ITALIANS AT INGS OF
ORLEANS.
Oyster Bay, N. Y., July 9.- The first
official caller on President Roosevelt at
Sagamore Hill since his arrival here
was Rev. John Hay Cushing, a Catholic
priest of Denver, Colo., who went there
yesterday to fire a complaint against
Ambassador Meyer, at Rome. Mr.
Cushing claims that he and twenty
eight other priests were driven out of
the Denver diocese by Bishop Matz for
no other reason than their failure to
vote for him for the bishopric. He said
he was the fourth to go. Protests were
sent to Rome and later the twenty- nine
priests, as well as Bishop Matz, went
there to state their case before the
Vatican. The fight has continued with
out success ever since 1888. In 1901
Bishop Matz is alleged to have had
Mr. Cushing arrested in Rome for forcing
himself into his presence, and it
is said Cushing was put in jail by the
Italian authorities, who openly admitted
that it was in retaliation for the
lynching of Italians in New Orleans.
He claims he was trated to great indignities
, and that Ambassador Meyer
and Consul de Castro were negligent in
protecting him as an American citizen.
Mr. Cushing claims further that three
New York men furnished Bishop Matz
with$ 30,000 with which to fight the
priests in their claim to restoration to
ecclesiastical functions. When Mr.
Cushing called the president was not
at home, but he left certain
and will return on Thursday. papers

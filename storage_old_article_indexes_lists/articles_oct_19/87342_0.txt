The Recent Kentucky Tragedy.
The Louisville Courier, of the 4th inst., gives the
particulars of the affray in Hawesville, Ky., on the
18th inst., but the writer of the account appears to
have been much prejudiced in regard to the affair.
He says:
A fewd had existed for a year between Lowe and
Cicero Maxwell, Commonwealth's Attorney of that
judicial district, which had its origin in party politics.
Lowe sent his adversary a challenge sometime since,
which he refused to notice. Lowe then sent him
word he would cowhide him on sight. Maxwell did
not attend court at the last term, and it is said for
the reason he wished to avoid a personal conflict
with his determined and desperate foe.
The Court met on Tuesday, and Lowe publicly declared
Maxwell a poltroon and a coward. The information
was given to Maxwell, who armed himself,
and, with a party of friends, attacked Lowe. The
latter, as we related yesterday, retreated. A number
of shots were fired, one of which killed a man named
Aldridge, or Eskring. Lowe was wounded and finally
caught. It was thought for a while the mob would
lynch him, but finally he was taken to prison and dis
armed.
The town was feverish with excitement, and, on
Wednesday night, the mob, who of course hated
Lowe,( mobs always hate brave men,) increased in
numbers and the thirst for blood. During the night
it was decided to force the jail and lynch Lowe, or, if
they could'nt approach him, kill him outright.
On yesterday morning, in accordance with the
plans, the mob attacked the jail, and fearing to lay
hands upon their victim, fired upon him. He received
sixteen or eighteen balls in vital parts, and died
some instantly.

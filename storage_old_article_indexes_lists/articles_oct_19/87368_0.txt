Timely Arrival of Soldiers.
BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Nov. 15.- The
timely arrival of troops at Carrollton,
Pickens county, about daylight yesterday
morning thwarted the efforts of a
mob to lynch Bud Beard, colored, on
trial here for a brutal assault on a
child. The lynchers were just
preparing to close in upon the
courthouse, where the sheriff and
a dozen deputies had stood guard
all night, when the guards of Tusca
drove up and dispersed the
loosa throng.

NEGRO TAKEN FROM
JAIL AND LYNCHED
Had Killed Samuel Lusco.
Was Hanged to a
Trestle
Inverness, Miss .. March 22.- An unidentified
negro, arrested yesterday,
charged with the killing of Samuel
Lusco, who was in charge of a car of
fruit en route from New Orleans to
Memphis, was taken from the town jail
here last night by a mob and hanged
from a railroad trestle.
The negro employed by Lusco as a
helper, slot and killed his employer, it
is alleged, while the train to which the
car was attached was en route from
Inverness to Isola, presumably for the
purpose of robbery. He was arrested
at Isola and returned to Inverness,
where he was placed in the rather frail
jail, from which he was taken last
night, the mob foreing an entrance to
the prison ..
So far as can be ascertained efforts
to establish the identify of the members
of the mob have been without result
.-

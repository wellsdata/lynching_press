ORIGIN OF LYNCH LAW IN AMERICA.
John Lynch a terrible Judge, was a native
of South Carolina, who emigrated to Kentucky
shortly after Daniel Boon. The settlers
were 450 miles from any seat of Justice,
The appointment of Lynch as Judge, first
took place in the case of an Indian who stole
a horse from Daniel Boone., The Indian was
caught almost in the act, and Boone imme.
diately instituted a court and 12 Jurors to
try the offence. John Lynch was elected
Chief Justice. The Indian was tried, convicted
, and sentenced to receive 39 stripes,
which was forthwith given. The authority
thus given to Lynch was retained, and trials
under Lynch law were had whenever any
outrage was committed. Lynch was a dar
ing dissolute fellow; he outlived Boone, and
the latter part of his life on an island
in resided the Mississippi.

Head Torn from Body.
About 50 men composed the mob
that did the lynching. It was well
organized and worked with expedition.
The sheriff and nis deputies were
overcome and bound and then placed
in one of the cells of the jail. Clifton
was taken out and a gag put in
his mouth to stifle his cries. After
his hands and feet haa been bound he
was dragged to a bridge west of town
from which he was hanged.
The rope used was so long that the
length of the drop given him caused
his head to be torn from the body
and the latter fell into the gully
crossed by the bridge, 40 feet below.
The body was permitted to remain
where it had fallen until the
day. next

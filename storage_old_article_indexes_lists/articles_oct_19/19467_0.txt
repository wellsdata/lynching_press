No arrests in connection with the
burning of Walker have been made
and only about twenty- five men took
active part in the work. At least
an
one of the borough policemen is said
to be implicated in the lynching.
Chief of Police Umstead had been
warned, it is said, in ample time of
the gathering of the mob to lynch
Walker, but he did not raise a hand
prevent it.

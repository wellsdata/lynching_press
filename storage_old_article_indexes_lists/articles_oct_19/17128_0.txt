According to the evidence elicited before

ler, somewhere about 8 o'clock, on the even
above named and called for Mr. Butler,

took place between them, after which
they proceeded together to the road gate, a
short distance
passed through the gate into the public road,
a blow on
the head with a heavy musket, which felled
him insensible to the ground, and which produced
death in about three hours. Mrs. But

THE EXCITEMENT AT DENTON- Dave Thom
as, the Murderer, Hung hy a Mob.- We sta
yesterday that Dave Thomas, the negro
who murdered Mr. Wm. H. Butler, in Caro
line county, Md., on the 27th ult., had been
tried at Denton, and convicted of murder in
the second degree," and that the verdict had
caused so much dissatisfaction as to induce
many citizens to threaten a resort to lynch
law on Thursday last, the day on which the
prisoner was found guilty. The prompt in
terf rence of the law, however, prevented the
threat from being carried into execution at
the time.- But, it appears, the vengeance of
the populace was only temporarily stayed.
We learn from a letter of a correspondent we
received yesterday, that a large and excited
etowd assembled about twelve o'clock on
Saturday night, proceeded to the jail, broke
it open, took the prisoner out and hung him
from a plank which they nailed to a window
on the outside, in the story of the
building, he was suspended until life was
extinct, when he was cut down and his body
conveyed back into the jail. Nor did the
mob Sstop here. They then released and set
at liberty two other prisoners, one of whom
had been sentenced to the penitentiary.
We learn from another source that the sher
iff was siczed and tied by the mob before they
proceeded to their murderous work. This is
ono of the most daring outrages ever
trated in Maryland. perpe

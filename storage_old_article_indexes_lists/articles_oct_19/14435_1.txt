NO CLUE TO THE LYNCHERS,
The Jailor was the Only Person Who Saw
Them Arrive or Depart.
COLUMBIA, S. C., Dec. 30.- There is
absolutely no clue to the identity of
any of the mob who lynched the eight
negroes in Barnwell. Not a witness
can be found, except the jailor, who
saw them enter or leave the town.
They appeared at the jail as suddenly
and silently as they vanished after
their terrible revenge.
The jailer knows that each of the
prisoners was closely questioned by
executioners before they
their were
killed, but it is doubtful whether the
character of the questions and answers
will ever be known.
Sam Lee and Alfred Grant, two negroes
who were in the jail as accessories
to the murder of Heffernan, were
seized by some of the mob, but others
protested, and they were left in jail,
nearly frightened out of their wits.
The negroes do not have anything to
say about the lynching in the presence
of whites. It is said on good authority,
however, that a vast number of them
will leave Barnwell County as soon as
they can make the necessary arrangements
.
The lynching is strongly condemned
in all parts of the State, except Barn
well, where the seem to think it
justified by the people repeated outrages.

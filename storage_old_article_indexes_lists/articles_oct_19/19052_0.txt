Lynching
Is Probed
Nashville, Tenn., Dec. 18 .-( AP)
-Shortly after a special lynching
charge was delivered to the David
son county grand jury, Governor
Hill McAllister decided today to
offer a$ 1,000 reward for the apprehension
of the perpetrators of
the kidnap- lynching of a Negro
last week.
Nashville, Tenn., Dec. 18.( AP) ---
Ordering that other matters be laid
aside, criminal Judge Chester K. Hart
today instructed the Davidson county
grand jury to take immediate steps to
bring to justice those guilty in the
last week's lynching of Cord Cheek,
19- year- old Negro.
To hear the special charge, Judge
Hart summoned a grand jury as soon
as court opened.
" Mob violence or lynching." he said,
" strikes at the very base of orderly
government and should not be, under
any circumstances, tolerated or connived
at. If for a moment mob rule
is substituted for the orderly process
of the law, we bordering on
are
anarchy."
The charge recited that while the
Negro's body was found hanging in
Maury county, where he had been accused
of an attempted attack on a
white girl, he was abducted by a band
of armed men in Nashville.
He had been brought to the David
son county jail for safe keeping and
had been released when the Maury
grand jury failed to return an
county indictment.

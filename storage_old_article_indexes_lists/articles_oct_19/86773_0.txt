THE particulars of the shooting at
Hurricane Bridge, a mere statement
of which we gave last week, are
these. They are communicated to
the Cincinnati press, under date,
Huntington, W. Va., June 27th:
Evening before last a strange lady
and gentleman arrived here in a buggy
for the night.
terday morning the gentleman left
driving eastward. The lady went
down the river at 10 a. m., and landed
at South Point. During the day in
formation reached here that the male
party was a horse- thief from Green
field, Ohio. Thereupon Marshal
Mitchell and Mr. Turner, of this city,
at once started in pursnit. At one
o'clock this morning they overtook
the thief near Hurricane Station. An
encounter took place, the full details
of which have not reached us, but we
have intelligence that the Marshal
and Turner were found lying help
less on the highway this morning,
both shot. Mitchell died about 11
a. m., and Turner's injuries it is believed
, will prove fatal too. The thief
then stole a fresh horse in the vicinity
and escaped.
He came to the Ohio river some
twelve miles below this city, left his
horse, and took passage on the Parsons
for this city. He spent some
hours here, and then took the noon
preket for Pomeroy, where he was
arrested upon a description given by
from this city. He was
telegram taken back to Huntington.
The Murderer Lynched.
The murderer was taken to the
Winfield, Putnam county, jail. On
Friday night, eighteen citizens, un-
disguised, appeared at the jail, and
taking the keys from the jailor, took
the prisoner out, and proceeded with
him some two miles from town, and
there hung him to a tree. The murderer
left the jail singing, but the
lynchers made him soon cease from
that sort of bravado.
Our exchanges speak of him as J.
M. Cox and as M. JOHNSON. His
father, it is thought, lives at Boyd,
Mecklenburg county, Virginia. On
his person at the time of his arrest in
Pomeroy were slips from newspapers
giving accounts of the shooting of a
colored waiter on the steamer J. B.
Maud on the Mississippi river, by
one J. M. Cox, of Texas. The ac
counts closed with a statement
Cox had escaped. that

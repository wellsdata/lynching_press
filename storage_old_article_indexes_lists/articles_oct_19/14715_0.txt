STRUNG UP BY A MOB.
John Terrell, Slayer of Conductor Price,
Hanged at Bedford, Ind.
BEDFORD, Ind., May 15 .-- At 2:10 this
morning a mob of 100 men appeared be
fore the jail here, forced the sheriff to
give up the keys and took John Terrell,
who murdered Conductor L. F. Price at
Seymour, from his cell and hanged him
in the jail yard. Terrell begged for his
life, but his appeals were met with
silence. The lynching was conducted
in the most orderly manner, Terrell's
cries being the only sound heard. After
lynching their man the mob requested
that the body be not taken down until
daylight after which it dispersed.
The mob hanged Terrell to a tree in
the jail yard within twelve feet of the
railroad track so that all passing trains
this morning can see his body. He was
dressed as though he had been expect
ing them. There were forty- three men
at the jail masked and about fifty or
sixty standing guard at different points
over the city.
Terrell's crime was the murder of
Conductor L. F. Price of the Ohio&
Mississippi road. The assassination
was as cowardly as it was brutal. It
seems that Terrell tendered an old pass
when asked for his fare, which the conductor
refused. After an altercation
Terrell's father, a wealthy stock dealer
of Lawrence County, paid his fare for
him. Price then left and was standing
in the door with his back toward Ter
rell, who was closely following him,
when the latter fired twice, each bullet
piercing the kidneys and passing for
ward and out through the stomach
his victim. of

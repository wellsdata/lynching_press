THE MURDER AT MONTROSE.- The pa.
pers for two weeks have all had more or
less to say about the murder of Mr. Me.
lancton Knight, at Montrose Iowa- the
arrest of his partner and one or two other
persons as his supposed murderers, and
their accidental reprieve from execution,
by virtue of Lynch law, and subsequent
confinement to await a legal trial. It
seems, now, from a statement in the Un
ion, that Mr. Knight has not been murdered
-- and that he is at Jefferson Bar
racks a soldier in the United States army
-- that, becoming involved in business, he
adopted the expedient of absconding at
the time stated, and in order to punish a
man who had threatened his life, he left
behind him the indications of murder,
which so much excited the people. The
letter which was found, after his disap.
pearance, was smeared with blood from his
nose, which was then bleeding.
" He took the hatchet which was found,
cut his hat with it, stained its blade with
blood, cut from his head some hair, at
tatched it to the blood upon the hatchet,
collected blood in his hand and rubbed it
upon the door jam, went to the river, got
into a canoe and floated down under the
guards of the boais to being
prevent seen
,
arrived at Hannibal and enlisted in the
army."
If all this be so, a great deal of unde
served sympathy has been wasted on Mr.
Knight, and two men were very near fal
ling victims, to mob violence, in conse.
of his malignant disposition. --St.

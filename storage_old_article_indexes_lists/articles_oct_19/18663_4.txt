The Post addresses these remarks
to the attorney general, because the
lynching of Robert Praeger in Illinois
involved no infraction of federal law.
It violated the statutes of Illinois and
the guilty murderers if apprehended
are amenable only to Illinois law.
The attorney general was in fact
lecturing the North for the lynching
of a white enemy alien suspected of
being a spy. In the section wherein
the attorney general was born and
reared are cases for his consideration
brutal and murderous that they
so cry out to heaven.- Houston Post.

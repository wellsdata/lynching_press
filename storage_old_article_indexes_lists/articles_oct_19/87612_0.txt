A NEGRO LYNCHED.
Erastus Brown Taken from the Jall at
Union, Mo., and Hanged.
UNION, Mo., July 12.- Erastus Brown,
the negro who criminally assaulted
Annie Foerbing near Union, Mo., one
week ago, was taken from the jail at
Union at 2:30 a. m. Saturday and hanged
to a willow tree, one mile southeast.
Forty or 50 mounted men rode into
Union at two o'clock. They galloped
four abreast until they were within
one block of the jail, where they divided
into two squads. One squad
rode north and the other rode south,
completely surrounding the houses of
the sheriff and jailer. At each house
they placed a strong guard. The balance
rode quickly to the jail and at
tacked the iron doors with sledge ham
mers and cold chisels. The noise
awakened many of the villagers and
they hurried to the jail the avowed
purpose of preventing with a lynching.

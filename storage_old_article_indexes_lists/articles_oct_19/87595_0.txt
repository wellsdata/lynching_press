JOKE ON GIRL BATHERS.
Hobo Sat en Their Clothes and
Smoked Until Friends Made
Him Flee.
Des Moines .-- Half a dozen girls,

Des Moines river, dared each other to
go in swimming one evening recent

ing up their clothes in a pile. This
done, he sat down upon them and be

he pulled at his old black pipe con

him, with their heads just above water.
Not until a company of young men,
coming to visit the girls in camp, were
heard in the distance did the hobo
go away,

with the water half choking them as
they spoke, told what had happened.
The young men declared they would
find the brute and lynch him. But
they did neither. When the searchers
returned to camp the girls were dress
ed and anxiously waiting to
company. receive

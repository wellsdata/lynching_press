Lynch Law continues to prevail in California
although it has been banished from the
precincts of the larger cities and has retreated
to the placers and small towns. By the last
steamer's news we were informed of no less
than five men having been hung by lynch law
in various parts of the State. One of these
was a professional gambler, who quarreled
with and killed a trader with whom he was
playing monte. He was hung at Shasta.
Two others robbed and murdered a couple of
storekeepers at Eureka, and the remaining
two of the five were Mexican horse thieves,
who were executed summarily at Monterey.
In all of these cases these miserable wretch-
es who suffered the penalty of death for their
crimes were regularly tried by a lynch court
and jury, according to the forms and usages
of genuine law, though rejecting the technical-
ities; and, curiously, one of the trials, that at
Eureka, lasted a whole week, clearly evincing
that the lynchers were not so intent upon the
punishment of the offenders as to deny them
justice of a full hearing first ..- Phil. N. A.

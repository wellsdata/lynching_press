Hot Springs, June 21.- Speaking
from the viewpoint of law enforce
ment, Circuit Judge Calvin T. Cont
nam today issued a statement, in
which he expressed regret over the
action of the pob that last night lynched
Will Norman, the negro who
murdered Garland Huff, daughter of
Judge and Mrs. C. Floyd Huff. After
declaring that the murder of the in-
nocent girl was" the most horrible
and outrageous in the category of
crime," and expressing the deepest
sympathy for Judge and Mrs. Huff
Jude Cotham said:
" Two wrongs, however, never make
a right. As I have said on other occasions
, the law is sufficient. The
legislature of 1909, with a view to the
prevention of mob violence and lynch
law in cases like this, passed a law,
which authorized the circuit judge,
when notified that there is danger oft
mob violence to call a special Grand
Jury and special petit jury to try the
offender, and thereby give an opportunity
of meting out justice according-
to the forms of law.
" A trial could have been had in 24
hours after the negro had been incarcerated
in jail."
Barbarism vs. Barbarism.
" We have been making a hard battle
here for several years for the en-
forcement of the law, and had the
triumphed in this instance, it
law
would have spoken volumes for the
self- restraint of our people, and their
respect for law. But such was not
to be. In the full glare of electric
lights, in the most public place in our
city, this negro was not only hung
up by a rope and riddled with bullets,
but his body actually burned after life
was extinct. This was meeting barbarism
with barbarism. It was thought
that this would prove to be a salutary
lesson and would have a tendency to
prevent other offenses of the same
nature, but I fear that such will not
be the case. It would have been a
much better lesson had he been ex-
ecuted after a fair trial, not by self-
appointed execution who had neither
legal nor moral right to take away
his life. It may be true that he had
forfeited the right to live and fully
deserved his fate, but if so he should
have received it at the hands of the
law and doubtless would have done
so and that right speedily, had the
law been permitted to take its course.
Lynching Inevitable.
" It is a dangerous thing in a com-
munity for a mob to be the Judge,
jury and executor. I fear that this
affair will be exploited in all of the
leading metropolitan papers of the
East, and will be the means of giving
Hot Springs some more bad advertising
. At the same time, however, I
feel sure from personal knowledge,
and from reports which have reached
me as to the members and determined
character of the mob which tyuch-
ed this negro, that neither the
nor all the officers could have court pre-
vented this occurrence."
The funeral of Miss Garland Huff
took place from the family residence
on Upper Whittington avenue
this afternoon at 2:30 o'clock. Service
in the charge of the Rev. Dr. Hickok,
pastor of the First Presbyteriar
church. Burial was in Greenwood
cemetery.

hel dtoday at which resolutions were

. The street car company als

His Missouri Record.
Sedalia, Mo., March 26.-W. H. Wal
lace, colored, who was lynched at La
Junta, Colo., for criminally assaulting
Mrs. Henrietta Miller, an aged white
woman, was sent to the penitentiary
for two years for a similar crime committed
here nearly four years ago.
Wallace was employed as porter at the
Missouri, Kansas& Texas passenger
depot and stood well in the community.
Almost weekly for three or four
months there were mysterious assaults
upon white girls returning home from
work at night. Bloodhounds were final
ly secured and Wallace was run down,
after which time there was never an
other case of assault. The evidence
against him was only circumstantial,
but he consented to plead guilty if
given a minimum sentence. He was
discharged under the three- fourths
rule after having served eighteen
months, and was next heard of in Den
ver. It was predicted when he went
to the penitentiary that he would eventually
figure as the principal in
lynching. a

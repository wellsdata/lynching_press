Mayor Roughly Handled. 1
Mayor Smith was seized by the
mob on Seventeenth street, near
the court house at 10 o'clock and
was threatened with lynching. He
was hustled to Harney street and
stopped at the foot of a trolley
pole on the cross- arm of which was
a coil of rope.
" Give us the key to the jail."
" If we can't get the nigger we'll
lynch you."
" He's no better than the nigger."
" He's a negro- lover."
These were in the mob.

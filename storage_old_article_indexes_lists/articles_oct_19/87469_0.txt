Among the ten thousand Compromises
that have been proposed, from that of Mr.
Thurlow Weed down to that of Gen. Joe
Lane, late of Oregon, why doesn't somebody
suggest an amendment to the Constitution
that shall guaranty peaceful travelers in the
South against tar and feathers, imprisonment,
hanging, drowning, and the other attentions
of kindred nature, which have of late be
come frequent in that sweet and sunny land?
If it is wrong to give a piece of bread to a
runaway negro, which can only be remedied
by dissolving Union, what shall we say
about lynching the unoffending white people?

TRIED TORTURE ON A NEGRO.
Burning and Hanging Couldn't Force Henry
Askew to Confess.
NEW ORLEANS, La., June 5 .-- Ever since Saturday
, when the body of Christina Winter
stein, the girl who was assaulted and murdered
near Biloxi, Miss., was found that town and all
the neighboring Mississippi coast has been in a
state of excitement searching for the murderer.
Extraordinary efforts were made to catch him.
and it was given out that he would be
lynched, but that certain evidence against the
murderer would have to be produced. Several
negroes who happened to be in the neighbor
hood of the scene of the murder were arrested
and were released, as the evidence against them
was weak. It seemed strongest against Henry
Askew, and to prevent a mob from lynching
he was taken from the Biloxi to the Mis
him sissippi City jail.

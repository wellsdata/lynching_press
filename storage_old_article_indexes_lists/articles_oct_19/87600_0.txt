WILL PROSECUTE
CONWAY MOB.
Conway, Oct. 7.- Sheriff J. H.
Harrell announces that he will go
before the grand jury in January
and prosecute the leaders of the
mob that lynched Frank Brown,
the negro charged with assaulting
Mrs. Arlena Lawrence and murdering
one of her children. He
says he has the names of ten or
more of the men who led the mob
and incited others to the lawless
deed. Sheriff Harrell says Brown
was gagged before he was hanged,
and if he made confession no
one knows anything a about it.

whites, but because of the injustice
handed down in these courts.
And now there is an opportunity
offered the Negro to better
his environments, and what do
you think? The white man,
through his official powers, is
calling out the police force and,
perhaps, the state militia, to stop
the man who is down; the man
who is legislated against; the
man who is segregated; the man
who cannot and is not allowed to
protect his wife and daughters;
the man who is lynched and shot
like a vonomous viper, guilty or
innocent; and the man whose
skin is not white. God is Judge
and Ruler and things must come
and go His way or perish

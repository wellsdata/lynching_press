MINISTERS PASS
RESOLUTIONS ON
SATURDAY'S RIOT
Regretting the mob spirit that prevailed
Saturday night and commending highly
the bravery of the police and other of-
ficials in their successful efforts to pre
vent a lynching, the Methodist ministersed
of the Birmingham and Bessemer districts
at their regular meeting passed
the following resolutions:
" The Methodist ministers of the Birmingham
and Bessemer districts in their
regular meeting of June the 21st in the
Birmingham First Church wish to ex
press their profound regret at the action
of some of the citizens of th community,
when on last Saturday night they yield-
ed to the mob spirit and turned the
streets of law- abiding Birmingham into
a scene of turmoil and peril.
" We in no way condone impertinence,
insolence or crime, but when men, wheta
er black or white, become offenders, we
insist that it is the duty of the law and
not the mob to punish. We congratulate
and honor our brave policemen and officials
in their determined and success
ful effort, at the risk of their own lives,
to save the accused negro from the wrath
of the mob.
" We assure them that not only do they
I have the gratitude of all law- abiding citizens
for saving us of the disgrace
of a public lynching, but that we
believe that many of the partici-
pants in the riot, in their calmer moments,
will be thankful that they were saved
from the sin of such an unjustifiable mur
der as the lynching of this negro would
have been.

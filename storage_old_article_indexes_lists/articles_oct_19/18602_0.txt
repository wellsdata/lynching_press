There had been rumors and mutter
ings ever since that the wretches
would be lynched, and late Friday
night a mob formed and broke into
the jail. The sheriff was made a prisoner
, after stout resistance.
The police at 2 o'clock brought
Judge Bookwalter, the circuit judge,
to the jail. He made an earnest, elo
plea to let the law take its
quent course and not bring disgrace on Ver
million county by the first lynching
in its history. He assured the
men that Halls and Royce would
receive a severe punishment if
found guilty; that the trial jury would
do its duty. At first his words produced
a telling effect, but the leaders,
who are among the most prominent
men in the county, finally replied:
" Yes, we know the jury will convict
and give them a severe sentence but
,
He
Altgeld will pardon them out. recently
pardoned three rapists you sent
up from Champaign county for twenty
years men.
If any other man than Altgeld was
governor we would not lynch these
men, but we are determined he will
never have chance to turn them
loose." a

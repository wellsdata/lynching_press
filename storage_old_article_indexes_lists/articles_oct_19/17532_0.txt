LYNCH LAW ON THE MISSOURI RIVER.- On one of
the Missouri river steamboats, not long since, a
passenger was suspected of improper intimacy
with a young lady of fourteen, whom he repre-
sented as his sister. The facts of the case having
been verified. the crew and passengers held a meet
ing and voted that the couple should be married.
When the pair were called to receive the verdict,
girl seemed very much but man
rather hung back. The captain, however, settled
the matter by drawing his pistols and declaring
that the thing must be done, and at the next land
ing a Justice of the Peace was brought on board anded
the marriage was celebrated with great festivity,.

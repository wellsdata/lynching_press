DIES AT THE END OF A ROPE.
Slayer of the Copples Put to Death by
Determined Mob.
After having been torn with violence
from the custody of the sheriff by an
angry but well organized mob at Pan
croft, Neb., Loris Higgins Monday
morning was hung from the bridge
over Logan creek one and a quarter
miles north of Bancroft.
Higgins was on the way from Oma
ha to Pender for a second preliminary
hearing for the murder of Mr. and
Mrs. Walter Copple at their farm
home near Rosalie. Neb., early in the
morning of May 13, 1907. He had had
one preliminary hearing, but there
was some defect in the papers and a
second hearing been made necessary
.
The mob was composed of citizens
of Bancroft and farmers in the vicinity
. All were armed with either Winchesters
or revolvers. The determined
men made a grand rush on the train
immediately upon its arrival at 8:35
a. m., overpowered Sheriff Sid Young
and Deputy Sheriff Newell, cut the
chain which bound the prisoner to
the sheriff, but a rope around his neck,
dragged him out on the platform, took
an ante- mortem. statement, allowed
him one minute for prayer,
him to the bridge and let him drop hauled.

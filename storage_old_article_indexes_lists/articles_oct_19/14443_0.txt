FREDERICK, MD., Nov. 17.- Frederick
a negro, food at the
residence of Hamilton' Giesbert, near this
city, yesterday afternoon. After eating a
meal he attacked Miss Tillie Jones, who
he discovered was alone in the house. In
overcoming the girl's resistance the negro
broke her nose and cut her with a razor.
He was arrested and held for a hearing on
Monday, Later he was taken from the
jail by a mob and hanged to a tree, on
which a few years ago a negro named
Bigus was lynched for the same crime.
ortly before midnight a committee of
a half- dozen went to the jail door and demanded
the keys. Sheriff Zimmerman
refused to give them up. There was an
other consultation, the word was passed
among the 300 persons in the mob and the
whole body moved toward the prison. As
the leaders reached the stout oaken side
door Sheriff Zimmerman raised a window
and fired his revolver, but no one was
hurt. He also rang the jail bell for assistance
, but none came.
In an instant the jail door gave way be
fore the infuriated citizens, A moment
later a dozen stalwart men were hammer
ing at the door of Goings' cell.
While the negro crouched in a corner
piteously begging for mercy, the bars of
his cell door were wrenched from their
fastenings and was dragged out of the
jail and lynched he.

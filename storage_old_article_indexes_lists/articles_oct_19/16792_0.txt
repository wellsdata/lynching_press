OGLE CÅ’UN' Y- LYNCH LAW.- The Attorney
General of the state of Illinois, Mr.
Lamborn, has published an opinion relative
to the recent exercise of the lynch
law in Ogle county, in the case of the
Driscalls. Mr. Lamborn regards the sum
mary execution of the horse thieves, as
wholly unjustifiable and uncalled for in the
exigencies of the case. He says," I have
no doubt that when the indignation and
phrenzy of the occasion, shall have passed
away, the actors in the general tragedy
will join in the general lamentation, which
must pervade society wherever the bloody
details are made known." He contends
that the laws of Illinois, are sufficiently
rigid and fully adequate to any emergency.
Nearly thirty persons have been sentenced
to the penitentiary within the last year,
from the stricts infected with the horse
thieves and blacklegs. The plea there
fore that the arm of the law is too weak,
to bring offenders to justice, is wholly
without foundation. The prosecutions in
the northern counties of Illinois have been
nusually severe, as is proved by the num
ber of prisoners sent to the penitentiary,
from the very district of country, suppos d
to be under the control of a gang of des
peradocs.-

Extact of a letter to a gentleman in New
York, dated Cadiz, November 13.
" The nets yesterday from the interior
of this country is of a very alarming na
ture. In many places the people are in a
state of insurrection. Want of bread has
driven the lower classes to great extremity
, and in consequence to some shocking
outrages. In one town the poorer inhabitants
have risen in a mob and hanged
the governor.

THE MOB MURDERS OF IOWA.
Shocking Scenes.
It is time that the lynchings which have
recently taken place in Iowa were called by
the right names, and the legal tribunals of
the State were setting about to vindicate
the majesty of the law by the punishment
of the wretches who have taken the laws in
their own hands. The hanging of Wm. B.
Thomas, in Montezuma, was as foul a mur
der as was ever perpetrated by a midnight
assassin. The Oshkosh Herald gives the
the following additional particulars of the
event:
" No sooner was the decision of the court
given( changing the venue, in order that he
might have a fair trial) than a regular organized
mob of about two hundred men
proceeded to the old court- house, where
the prisoner was confined, and demanded,
and by force took Thomas from the custody
of the sheriff, and amid the terrific
shrieks of the prisoner and the most hellish
reveling of the mob, carried him away to
a tree which they had previously prepared,
in the suburbs of the town. Here, without
even adhering to the customs of lynch law,
or abiding by the honor of mob force, they
placed the rope around the prisoner's neck
and demanded a confession of the crime.
The prisoner plead his innocence. The
rope was drawn over a limb, and the pris-
oner swung into the air After a few strug-
.
gles he was let down, and again demanded
to make confession. Again he pleaded in-
nocent of the crime. Again he was hung
up and a fire kindled beneath his feet.-
The mob threatened to burn him if he did
not confess the murder. Again he was let
down. From the strangulation received,
he had lost his strength and his voice.-
The mob still demanded a confession. The
prisoner, in the faintness of death, porsist-
ed that he was innocent. Again he was
hung up, where he remained until he was
dead."
The Herald says that this makes the
tenth victim of mob violence in Iowa since
first of April- four in Jacksou, five in
the Cedar and one in Poweshiek.

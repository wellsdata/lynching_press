Arrest of a Murderer.
A farmer named Vincent Moore, living
in Montgomery county, emigrated to California
in the spring of 1850, and returned
last fall of the dust
home with a goodly portion,
paid off his debts, and was considered one
of the bon tons. His neighbors thought it
was" all right" and congratulated the lucky
adventurer on his unusual good fortune.-
Some people were uncourteous enough to
think he had made his money in a rather
suspicious manner; but on Wednesday last,
the mystery was solved. While Moore was
in Clarksville, on some business, he was
arrested on a requisition from the Governor
of California to the Governor of this State,
which had been granted, on a charge of murder
and It that Moore
robbery. appears
was employed in an extensive trading house
in California, and thinking he was not making
money fast enough, concluded that he
would adopt another plan and so one night
,
he murdered his employer, and robbed him
of 12,000 and then" cut stick" for Mis-
$
,
souri. It is very presumable that the old
covey will have a hard time of it on his ar
rival in the El Dorado and instead of his
,
scenes in California ending with the bright
fancy of golden dreams, he will most probably
play the hero in the popular tragedy of
" Lynch Law, the Hemp Rope.".

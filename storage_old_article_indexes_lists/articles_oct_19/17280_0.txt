If the church- Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish- does not give to
the people of the earth the leadership that they are so hungry and
thirsty for, then the church will not be able to survive in the post- war
world. The voice of the church is strangely silent in the midst of
lynching, poll tax, brutality, jimerowism of Negro soldiers, segregated
blood banks and all the other ungodly practices.- Rev. Adam Clayton
Powell in Peoples( N. Y.) Voice.
St.

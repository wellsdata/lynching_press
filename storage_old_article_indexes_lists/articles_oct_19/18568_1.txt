SECREST TAKEN TO MARION.
There is no Doubt of His Sanity, and
the Asylum Authorities at Morgan
ton Refuse to Take Him Back.
Special to the News and Observer.
MORGANTON, N. C., Sept. 5 .-- Hoke
Secrest, who was brought here Monday
by special officer Perry, was tendered to
the authorities of the State Hospital,
from which place he escaped some five
years ago. The Superintendent of the
hospital declined to receive him, as there
is no doubt of his sanity, and so he was
placed in jail and kept until to- day.
when he was taken to Marion jail, a cÄƒ
pias having been issued for him yesterday
. He will no doubt be tried again
and hung, as the murder of his wife and
step- child in 1878 was one of the most
cold blooded, diabolical crimes ever committed
in North Carolina or elsewhere.
There is talk of lynching the wretch, but
it is to be hoped that the people will
resort to such violence. not

Suit in Federal Court Against Alleged
Lynchers of William J. Thacker.
Tas
Flemingsburg, Ky., July 15.- Mary M.
Thacker, as next friend for her infant
children, has brought a$ 50,000 damage
suit in the federal court of the eastern
district of Kentucky for the death of
her husband, Wm. J. Thacker, who was
hanged here about one year ago. It will
be recalled that some two years ago
while young John Gordon was on his
way home from Foxport, Ky., he was
murdered by Thacker and that Thacker
was placed in jail here and given two
trials in the circuit court of this county
, each of which resulted in a reversal
in the court of appeals of Kenutcky;
In July, 1903, while awaiting his third
trial Thacker was dragged from jail by
a mob and lynched after barbarous
treatment.
Since that time it was supposed by
the people here that the matter was
ended, and that neither civil or criminal
proceedings would be instituted
against the parties composing the mob.
The civil action for damages is a great
surprise, for it will bring before the
court some of the best people of this
country on a serious charge.
The Thackers lived at Noah, Lewis
but have
county, for several years,
within the last few months moved to
Scioto county, Ohio, for the purpose,
it is claimed, to give the federal court
jurisdiction instead of the state courts.
The feeling against Thacker in this
county for his crime was very bitter,
and it is supposed the family of
Thacker feared that a jury here would
fail to give them damages.
The plaintiff claims that there was
a conspiracy on the part of numerous
citizens of this county to take the life
of her husband. Among the alleged
conspirators she names George Gor
John Gordon,
don, Perry Gordon,
James Gordon, Wes Showen, Clate
Charles Farrow, Lafe Far
Farrow,
row, Samuel Plank, Zicks Cline,
James Clary, Lucien Goodman, Jesse
Goodman, Otho Martin, Bert Martin,
Robert Dudley, Frank Vincent,
George Vincent, Matt Mulaney, John
Morris, George T. Becket, Richard
James. Mitchell,
Berry, Wick Lucas,
Joseph McCleary, and John Hinton.
Mrs. Thacker is represented by
torney W. C. Halbert, of Vanceburg At.

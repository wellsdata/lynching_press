-Lynching as a penalty for atrocious crimes
is becoming a common occurrence in various
parts of the country. Three cases of the kind
occurred in one day last week. A negro in
South Carolina guilty of outraging a white girl,
a negro in Mississippi who had attempted the
same crime upon a child, and a half- witted
railroad laborer who had killed fellow- work
man at Las Vegas, N. M., were a the victims.

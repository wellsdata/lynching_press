LA JUNTA FIEND.
The Pullman Car Rapist and His
Black Record
SERVED TIME IN MISSOURI..
A special dispatch to the Denver
News, from La Junta, under date of
March 26, says:
An inquest was held today by Coroner
Green, of Rocky Ford, on the re
mains of W. H. Wa.lace, lynched by a
mob last night.
The verdict of the coroner's jury
was that Wallace came to his death
by gunshot wounds and strangulation
at the hands of a party or parties un
known.
Coroner Green arrived in town this
morning at 1:30, and after seeing the
body cut down, it was taken to the
morgue.
This morning was spent in trying to
secure a jury. Men of the town either
refused to serve or made a sufficient
excuse and the work of selecting the
jury was only completed this evening
about 5 o'clock.
After the verdict was rendered Undertaken
Cok prepared the body for
inspection, and many people passed
along and viewed the remains of the
notorious colored man.
Mrs. G. W. white, of this city, whose
house was broken into a couple of
months ago and an attempted assault
made upon her, viewed the remains
this afternoon and positively identified
the man as being the one who entered
her house recently. He turned on the
electric light and when she awoke
thrust a revolver against her throat
with such fierceness that it badly
bruiseu her neck, saying:" If you
scream I will k you." Mrs. White,
thinking she was going to be killed
anyway, screamed with all her might,
which aroused the neighbors and e
man fled. Since Mrs. White's positive
identification other things are being
charged against Wallace, and the people
are more than ever convinced that
the people have dispatched one of the
most desperate men in the annals of
crime,
The body was pierced with thirty
seven bullets, one of which severed
the spinal cord, and one pierced the
heart, while others pentrated the stomach
and various portions of the body.
Sherin Barr is the mos. thoroughly
out of humor man in the county to
day, as he was captured by a posse
headed by H. W. Potter, former sheriff
of this county, and the man who M.
Barr defeated at the recent election for
the office of sheriff.
The members of the conference committee
state that the most remarkable
thing of the whole affair is the nerve
displayed by Wallace. He asked for a
pen and paper and wrote a letter to ais
wife and gave her an order for s
wages, due him from the Santa Fe
Railway company. Members of the
committee state that his hand was as
steady as could be, he not seeming to
be in the slightest degree nervous. His
repeated successful outrages are
thought to be due to his supreme coolness
and nerve. There was no marks
of violence upon his head or face, and
when prepared for shipment the body
looked as natural as life. The body
will be sent to his wife in Denver to
morrow.
Mr. King, who was sent here by the
warden of the penitentiary with the
bloodhounds, is of the opinion that
Wallace is not the man who committed
the crime, as the nound not follow
his trail. The people are all thorough
ly convinced that the dog was not
working properly, as he did not take
the trail readily at any time, even
when he was started from the very
spot where the deed was committed.
Mrs. Miller, the victim of the assault,
is not so well this evening, and it is
doubtful whether she will be able to re-
sume her journey to Denver very soon.
The crowds which nave been on the
streets almost constantly since the
news of the crime became known have
dispersed and the city has resumed its
usual order of business. It is rumored,
however, that the authorities have the
names of a number of the leaders of
the lynching, and as the regular term
of the district court convenes the first
Monday in April, indictments will be
filed against them. It would be a difficult
task, however, to convict
one connected with the affair. any

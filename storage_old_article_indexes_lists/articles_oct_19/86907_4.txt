From the Baltimore American.
The conviction in Alabama
of the mem
ber of a mob which lynched a man some
months ago is calculated to give hope
to the friends of law and order. The
presiding judge imposed a sentence of
life imprisonment.
It requires
more
courage on the part of judge and jury
to thus vindicate the majesty of the law
than can readily be appreciated in other
sections of the country. The Alabama
case sets a precedent, and a most valuable
one. It teaches that the
best way
to enforce respect for the constituted
canons of behavior is to enforce the law.
If it is a genuine expression of the state
of public feeling there, it means that in
that locality at least- and the example
can easily become contagious- the
of the mob is on the ebb. rule

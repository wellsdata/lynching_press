Vigorous Investigation.
The vigor with which the investigation
into the lynching of the negro,
Alexander, last Monday, is being conducted
by the Pensacola authorities,
and the action of the governor in demanding
results therefrom will prob-
ably teach the lawless in that city
that it is no safer to commit murder
in a crowd than individually. Any
Pelt
violenc offered Sheriff Van
would only make the case of the
of Alexander more hopeless
for lynchers them.- Jacksonville Times- Union.

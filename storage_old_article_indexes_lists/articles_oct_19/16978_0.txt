LYNCH LAW- ONE MAN HUNG!
By the arrival of the Georgia, we have
files of the Panama Star and the Echo of
the 25th of March. Three of the murderers
of the passengers on the boat on
the Chagres had been tried and sentenced
to be shot. The Captain of the
band of robbers who attacked the train
of Howland& Aspinwall, was also under
sentence of death. W. Hance, who
murdered his brother- in- law, is in jail,
awaiting his trial.
The construction of the railroad was
steadily progressing.

his companions, were beating a miner,
when Myers, in passing, told them to
show fair play," and upbraided them
for all jumping on one man. Roe cursed
him, and while Myers was going off,
the former drew his revolver, and inflict
ed a mortal wound on Myers, who lived
but a few hours. A scene of great excite-
ment followed, Roe was placed in jail,
and a jury, under the Lynch law, was
forthwith empannelled. The authorities
used their utmost efforts to maintain the
supremacy of the laws, but in vain. After

This, for a short time, appeared to quiet
the mob.
The excitement, in a short
time time, again became uncont olable.
It was immediately put to vote that Roe
should be hanged, and carried

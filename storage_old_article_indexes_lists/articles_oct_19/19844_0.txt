CARROLLTON, Mo., March 14- Carroll
ton was greatly excited Saturday night
over the arrest and lynching of an un
known man, supposed to be a tramp,
who was arrested that day at Wakenda
for an assault upon Mrs. John Perreton,
the wife of a German farmer who lives
three miles northeast of town. Friday
afternoon about 3 o'clock the man
went to Mrs. Perreton's and asked
for a drink. Mrs. Perreton gave him s
cup of water, when he made known
his purpose, to accomplish which he
beat Mrs. Perreton almost to insensi-
bility. His crime done, he fled, closely
followed by the infuriated neighbors
Saturday the efforts of the officers were
rewarded by the capture, as above
stated.
The mob was thoroughly organized
for hours before the lynching took
place. The sheriff knew that night
fall meant an attack on the jail and
that the only salvation for his prisoner
was to fly with him from the country.
He selected two trusted deputies and
placing the prisoner in their charge at
dusk let them out of the west kitchen
door of the jail building. It was the
intention to reach a point on the Wa
bash track and by signal stop the early
evening train. This was thought to be
the only chance to save Gordon from
the mob's hands.
For a time it was supposed that the
exit from the jail had been made with
out attracting any attention, but their
flight had been discovered, and when
the deputies had reached the Santa Fe
tracks they found themselves suddenly
surrounded and overpowered members
of the mob. by

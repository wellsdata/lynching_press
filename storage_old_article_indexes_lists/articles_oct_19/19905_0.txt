LYNCHING OF A DESPERADO.
ANTONIO, Cal, July 22- Antonio has been infest.
ed for several months with a gang of rabbers who
have held up and robbed all stranzers coming into
town. The gang has tonight been broken up
by the hanging of the principal, Geo C O'Connor,
who in his capacity of Justice of the Peace,
shielded them and had the citizens arrested and
fined without the least provocation. Last even
ing O'Connor came from Alamosa. He fell asleep
and because the brakeman woke him at his destination
had the brakeman arrested. He then went
to the Raymond House and covered the proprietor
with five revolvers. After abusing the proprietor
he went home. This evening the feeling reached
its limit when O'Connor rode through the town
on horseback with a Winchester rifle aid five revolvers
, threatening every body, a vigilance committee
caught him in his saloon and hung him
an old slaughter house. in

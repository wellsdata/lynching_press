NEGRO MURDERERS LYNCHED.
Two Men Kill a Storekeeper at St
Gabriel, La., and Die for It.
Two negroes arrested for the murder
of a storekeeper named George Rabin, at
St. Gabriel, La., were lynched the other
night. The proof of their guilt was conclusive
, and popular indignation was
great. Sheriff Brown, fearing a jail de
livery, put the men on a Texas and Pacific
train, to be taken to New Orleans
for safe keeping. The people stopped the
train six miles below Plaquemine, locked
up the conductor and the deputy sheriff
took the negroes off and hanged them
and in the woods.

KELLY MILLER SAYS:
National Hysteria
According to the dictionary
hysteria is defined as a nerv-
Gus affection leading to
paro-
zysm often resulting in fits of
violent temper and uncontroll
-
able coduct. The discase effects
men and animals alike. It is
narrated in the Bible that when
the evil spirits were cast out of
a entered a herd
of swine which was stampeded
down a steep declivity, and
drowned themselves in the sea
.
Moving pictures frequently
reveal the effect of hysteria up-
on a herd of cattle, leading to a
violent commotion and unpredictable
behavior.
Man is supposed to be a rational
beng whose conduc is motviated
by reason and yet when evil
passion enters the mind of the
mob it acts as whimsically and as
vehemently as brutish beasts.
A blood- thirsty mob of lynch-
ers might well be defined as a
gang of men possessed of the
Devil. Hysteria, like the whirl
wnd, causes sudden vielent agia-
tion but we cannot tell whence it
cometh or whither it goeth.
all cases of hysteria the effect
transcends the cause, and often
there is no apparant cause at all.
Col. Chas. A. Lindberg captured
the imagination of the
Ameican people by his spectacular
oceanic flight. The emotions
of the American people
were so stirred that forthwith
he was boomed as a candidate
for the presidency, although
there was no casual relation
tween this aerial stunt and the be
function of our chief executive.
Wild hysteria is noticeable in
political campaigns. Otherwise
rational men, yell themselves
hoarse for no other reason than
to hear the sound of their own
yelling. Rival meetings stage
vociferous contests to see which
side can yell teh loudest over its
candidates, before utter exhaus-
tion.
The hysteria of the Jews at
the trial of Jesus vented itself
as vehemently as at any other
otubreak o history. It also reveals
the fate of a peacemaker
in a violent quarrel. Pontius
Pilate tried to stand aloof from
and rise above this hysteria
caused by Hebrew religious prejudice
. But the rabble madden-
cd by hysteria, would not have
it so. The judcious Pilate would
have no part in the condemnation
of a just man although he was
unable to prevent his execution.
Pilate before the Jewish mob
was in a very similar position
to a conscientious southern may
or at the hands of a blood-
thirsty mob bent upon lynching
and burng of a Negro sulprit,
innocent or guilty. The aroused
appetite for blod will not be appeased
short of vengeance.
Today, it might be said that
the German people are ruled by
hysteria under the spell of Hit
ler teh master rabbel- rouser of
modern time. On the other hand
the English people under the
sway of Prime Minister Chamberlain
are amendable to ague-
ment and reason.
Hysteria gains the immediate
victory over rationality.
The Negro race being of an
emotional and volatile temperament
, is easily given to hysteria.
In any controversy emotion
apt to outweigh deliberation. is
This was fully illustrated in
case of the nomination of Hugo
Black for a justiceship on the
supreme bench. The Senator
from Alabama had been one of
the most dynamic and forth
right champions of the New
Deal and the human right principles
for which it stands. But
when his name was sent to the
senate the vials of wrath were
let loose upon hs head. It wos dis
closed he at one time had been
an inactive member of the KKK
although he had subsequently
relinquished his membership
and repudiated its principles. He
declared that he never had, and
never would in his official capacity
deny the just rights of any
American citizen on account of
his race or color. This declaration
of principles but infuriated
the frenzied Negro detractors all
the more.
At the time, I assumed, or
to assume, a logical attitude tried in

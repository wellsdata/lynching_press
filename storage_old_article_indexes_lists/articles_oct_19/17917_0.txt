Two negroes were hanged by a
mob near Bartow last week. They
had killed Ed Granger, a well
known and highly respected white
man in the employ of the McCon
nell Turpentine Company near
Ft. Meade. It seems the negroes
were in the employ of the company
and wanted to quit work and Mr.
Granger tried to stop them Judge
Wall and Prosecuting Attorney
will investigate the affair and puu
the mob who hung the negroes
if ish they can be identified.

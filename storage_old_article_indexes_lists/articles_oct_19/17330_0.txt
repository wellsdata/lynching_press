BALTIMORE, Nov. 16.
The steamship Daniel Webster arrived
New York today bringing Californie
at,
dates to the 15th Oct .. four hundred passen.
gers, and eight hundred thousand dollars in
gold. The prosperity of the miners in California
was unprecedented. Crime in San
Francisco had made great progress since
the Vigilance Committee had been disbanded
. At the mines, however, Lynch law
was still practised. There was a project
on foot to divide the State, and at a public
meeting held for its discussion, it met with
great approbation. In the Southern coun.
some minors were making from one to
ties two thousand dollars a day.

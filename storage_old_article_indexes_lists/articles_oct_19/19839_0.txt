Judge Wolfe's Just Charge
to the Grand Jury.
In his charge to the grand jury
Monday Judge J. Emmet Wolfe was
outspoken in reprobating the Pensa
cola mob which lynched the negro
Dave Alexander on the morning of
April 5th. His language was strong
and should prove effective in arousing
the jury to a sense of its obligation
to make a thorough investigation into
the outrage, and, so far as possible,
relieve their city and county from the
stigma now resting upon them.
Judge Wolfe struck the very core
of the problem when he declared that
a mob's vengeance upon a criminal
worked comparatively but little injury
to the victim but, by defying the
law, did incalculable harm to the
community. For how slight, after
all, is the punishment inflicted by
death. It is as natural and, in the
last analysis, as painless to die as to
be born. The few brief moments of
suffering before unconsciousness
comes to the struggling victim are
soon passed then comes absolute re
lief from physical pain. As a matter
of fact a criminal is made to suffer
for more if left to the necessary delays
of a legal prosecution; to long
and dreary hours in a lonely cell
where he must bare his conscience
before his God; to the horrifying
words of the death sentence; then the
death watch, the solemn procession
to the gallows and the final launch
into eternity.
But it is very different with respect
to the community. Every lawless act
brings a reproach upon it; paints it
black to the eyes of all outsiders;
gives opportunity for its enemies to
point at it the" slow, unmoving finger
of scorn," and, above all, is bound to
reduce that most valuable of all as
sets, the self- respect of its own people
.

THE COLOR LINE IN TEXAS.
A Negro Lynched for Wanting to Marry a
White Girl.
SAN ANTONIO, Tex., Oct. 14.- A note from
Somerset, Atascora county, thirty miles from
San Antonio, gives the meager account of
the lynching of a negro named Alick. About
a month ago he endeavored to marry a white
girl. Her consent was obtained and he
would have succeeded but for his untimely
arrest. He was confined for some days, and
the people, in discussing the matter, grew
hotter and hotter. On Sunday night a party
of masked men took Alick from jail and
hanged him, and the jury returned a
of death at the hands of unknown parties verdict.

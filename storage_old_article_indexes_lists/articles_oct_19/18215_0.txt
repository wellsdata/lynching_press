WYTHEVILLE, VA., Sept. 1 .--
The lynching of Raymond Bird here
by a mob from outside of this town
has excited more attention outside
than it seems to have caused here.
Colored people here are taking no
outward action, but are watching
with interest the action of the white
folks. The Richmond
Planet, which
has been seen here is not seen any
more as there is a tense feeling, no
colored person knowing just what
will happen after the outside influences
, exerted by the Governor, the
Attorney General's office and the
State press have been withdrawn
,.

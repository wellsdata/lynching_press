GUTHRIE, Okla .. Sept. 20.- News has
just been received from Lincoln, a small

lynching of the leader of a gang of
horse thieves. His name was Perry
Cook. He had aided in several raids of
late, and a posse of farmers finally came
upon him in a cave.
He had in his possession half a dozen
horses, which fact so enraged the farm-

without giving they him time to say a word.

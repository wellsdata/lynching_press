MORE LYNCH LAW.- We learn from our California
files, that a man named Bill Harding, caught stealing a
horse on the American River, was tried by a lynch court.
He received nfiy lashes, had one half of his head shaved,
and was banished from the neighborhood, never to re
turn.
Five Mexicans, convicted before a lynch court, of
stealing cattle,& c., were hung on the San Joaquin
lately.,

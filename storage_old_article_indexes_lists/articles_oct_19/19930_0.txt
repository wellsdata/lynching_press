BRUTE CRIMES A. OF
Room and an Angry Mob.
ATLANTA, April 22 .-" That is the man!"
exclaimed Mrs. Cook, a lady of Henry County,
this state, during the court proceedings at
McDonough yesterday. Leonidas Johnson
had been on trial for attempted assault upon
a beautiful country girl several months ago.
Judge Branham had just finished sentencing
him, and had given him the extreme penalty
of the law- twenty years in the penitentiary
The judge had already finished when Mrs
Cook appeard in the court room and recognized
Johnson as the man who a few months
before had stealthily entered her home in the
absence of her husband and outrageously assaulted
her. The scene in the court room at this
and
announcement most exciting it was
was,
evident that the prisoner would be lynched
if not removed. Johnson was hurried to jail
under a heavy guard. The grand jury again
indicted him for rape, which is a capital
offense in Georgia. Last night a mob endeavored
to lynch the fellow, but this was pre
vented by shots from the sheriff's guard.
Johnson was brought to Atlanta to- day.
His record is one of the foulest. Several
months ago he committed an assault on an
estimable lady near Sunnyside, Spalding
county. Although only 23 years old, he has
already served five years in the penitentiary
He has
for attempted murder. been convicted
of burglary and sentenced to twenty
in the penitentiary and escaped. It is
years who
now thought that Johnson is the person who
committed terrible assaults on a number of
ladies in the same neighborhood within the
last two years. He lived in the same county
under several assumed names while all his
crimes were committed. There is great excitement
in Henry county, and fears are entertained
that mob will again try to lynch
him, although a the Atlanta jail is secure, and
citizen soldiers are plenty. Johnson's last
assault was on Miss Harris. Mrs. Cook, who
Johnson, was almost killed by the
recognized bruto.

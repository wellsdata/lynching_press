MOB OF BLACK MEN
ATTEMPT TO LYNCH WHITE
( By the Associated Negro Press)
Newport News, Va., Nov. 11.- The
attempt of a mob of Negroes to lynch
Isadore Cohen, white, after his auto-
mobile had run over a Negro child,
was frustrated by R. H. Green, a Negro
preacher, who fought off the white
man's assailants long enough to let
him escape in the car. Cohen is held
without bond, while the child, a girl,
whose skull fractured, cannot re
cover, hospital was officials say.

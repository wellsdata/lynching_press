ATLANTA, Ga., March 27.- A re
ward of$ 500 has been offered by Governor
Hugh M. Dorsey for the arrest
and conviction of any member of the
mob that lynched Spencer Evans, a
negro, at Crawfordvinlle in Talifaerro
county last Friday night; and in addition
to offering the reward Governor
Dorsey has requested Attorney- General
Clifford Walker to inform him whether
he has authority to call W. J. Sturdi
vant, sheriff of the county, to strict
account for what transpired.
The governor feels, in a way, that
the lynching was a slap at him on ac
count of the fact that he granted the
negro a respite. The negro was sentenced
to be hanged last Friday for
criminal assault. Governor Dorsey,
on application of the negro's Ã¥ttorneys
for time to present a petition for com
mutation of sentence to life imprison
ment granted a respite until Friday,
April 26. News of the governor's ac
tion reached Crawfordville in the af
ternoon, and the lynching took place
that night.
As the governor points out, he was
entirely within his constitutional
rights in granting the respite, and the
lynching of the negro, who was under
conviction and sentence, and a prisoner
securely held in jail, violently set at
the majesty and authority of
the naught law.

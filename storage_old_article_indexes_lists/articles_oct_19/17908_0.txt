Atlanta, Ga.- The reports of slaugh.
ter in various parts of Atlanta since the
sun went down, after the most careful
investigation possible at this time,
have resolved themselves down to a
fight between a number of county policemen
and deputies and an unknown
number of negroes. In the fight, which
took place in South Atlanta, and about
three miles from the city's center, and
in the vicinity of Clark University, a
negro institution, County Policeman
James L. Heard was killed, four officers
were wounded and three policemen
were missing at last reports. The num
ber of negroes dead is not known, possibly
it never will be known, but the
officers in the darkness claim to have
counted from six to fifteen dead or dy
ing negroes on the ground. The excitement
of the fight and the darkness
of the night made the counting uncertain
.
County Policeman Heard, with ten
other officers and citizens sworn
in as deputies, learning that negroes
were gathering, went to disperse them.
As they approached McDonough avenue
, an unknown number of negroes,
hidden behind fences and under houses,
fired a volley. Policeman Heard fell
dead. Policeman Frank Jordan, him
self wounded in the head, using the
dead body of Heard, emptied three
rounds into the negroes, apparently
avenging the cold- blooded assassination
. The other casualties were Policeman
Odum, wounded in the head;
Policeman A. C. Eubanks wounded in
,
the leg; Ernest Smith, a citizen, shot
in the hip. Three of the party were
reported missing.
Following the killing of Policeman
Heard the force which accompanied
him and were not disabled in the fight
pursued the negroes. Four escaped,
but six were put aboard a street car
under the guard of the police and deputies
and started for the county jail in
the center of the town. As the car approached
491 Crews street, a waiting
mob stopped the car. Two of the prisoners
, Sam McSaunder and Wiley
Brooks, made a bold dash for liberty.
The mob caught them in the yard of
the home occupied at the above number
by Mrs. R. C. Thompson, a highly respected
white woman. The negroes
were cut and beaten and left for dead.
Mrs. Thompson, watching the exciting
scene from the porch of her home,
dropped dead from what is supposed to
have been heart disease.
The police force succeeded in bring-.
ing the other four negroes to town and
they are now locked up in jail.
Later it was discovered that McSaun
der and Brooks were not dead. They
were brought to the city and are now
reported to be dying.
The lynching of Zeb Long, a negro,
at East Point, a suburb eight miles
south of the city, early today, has fur.
nished the most exciting event of the
last twenty- four hours. Long was ar
rested, charged with disorderly con
duct. He had threatened the marshal
of the town and appeared to be pre
pared to He
carry out his threats. H was
taken from the East Point jail, a flimsy
, after midnight, and hanged
structure in the woods half a mile from town.

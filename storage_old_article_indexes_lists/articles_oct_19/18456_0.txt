BALTIMORE, June 29.- Joseph Cocking
was lynched at La Plata, Md., early Saturday
morning. He was taken from the
county jail by an armed mob and hung
to a tree close by. Cocking was charged
with the murder of his wife and sister- in
law several months ago.
Cocking was brought to Baltimore
April 27 in order to escape the vengeance
of the mob and was returned to the
Charles county authorities May 21, as his
trial had been set for the day following.
His counsel asked for a two weeks' extension
of time which was refused and upon
the usual affidavits the case was removed
to an adjoining and would have
come up for trial in county September.

Wants to Indict Parties Who Swung
Up Negroes In Monroe, La.

ing of two negroes early Friday morn

to call upon District Judge Madison of

of the party which did the hanging
. In a letter to the sheriff of Mon
roe the governor said:
" Lynchings do not prevent crime.
/
law is more
One wholesome hanging by
effective than several lynchings. We
can not hope to have capital and im-
to our
migration continue to come
state such acts of lawlessness
every now with and then."

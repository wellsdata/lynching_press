ST. JOSEPH, Mo., Nov. 30.-
Leaders of the mob which lynched
a young Negro here early yester
day after he confessed attacking a
white woman remained unidentified
today as an official investigation
was pushed.
Leading citizens joined Governor
Guy B. Park and Attorney- General
Roy McKittrick in calling the
lynching of Lloyd Warner deplorable
and regrettable. But none
came forward to identify any of
the thousands of infuriated persons,
none of whom attempted to conceal
their identity, when they
stormed the Buchanan county jail,
fought troops and officers for five
hours and finally burned their vic
tim on a downtown street.
" This investigation is not going to
be just a smoke screen," asserted
Assistant Attorney- General William
O. Sawyer when he arrived to head
the investigation." The Attorney
General's office is going to get
the bottom of this case." at

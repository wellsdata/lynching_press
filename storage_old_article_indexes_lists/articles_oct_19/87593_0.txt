A Masked Mob Takes Possession of
the Jail at Hamilton, Mont.
Walter Jackson. Who Killed Slx
Year- Old Fonnie Bnek. Taken
Out and Hanged.
Hamilton
, Mont., Oct. 15.- Walter
Jackson, the convicted
murderer of
Fonnie Buck, a six- year- old boy, was
taken from the county jail here, late
Tuesday night, by a mob and lynched.
Shortly before midnight 75 masked
men, all armed with rifles or shotguns,
forced their way through the rear of
the jail and overpowered Jailer Stephens
, who was able to offer but slight
resistance. Jackson was found cring-
ing in the darkest portion of his cell.
He pleaded piteously for mercy, but
was rushed out into the street, where
the mob had already provided them
selves with a rope. This was quickly
thrown over an electric light pole and
the noose placed about Jackson's neck.
He was asked if he had anything to
say, but only pleaded for mercy. The
mob then pulled him into the air, after
which they quietly dispersed. Not a
shot was fired.
The identity of the mob leader is un
known. Thirty- five minutes after the
lynching Jackson's body was cut down
by the sheriff and coroner and removed
to the morgue.
The murder of ttle Fonnie Buck
was a peculiar atrocious crime. When
the boy's body was found it was horribly
mutilated. Suspicion pointed to
Jackson, and when he was arrested a
lynching was narrowly averted.
His
trial quickly followed, and a verdict
was returned within two hours. He was
sentenced to be hanged, but his
neys appealed to the supreme court attor.

ORIGIN OF THE TROUBLE.
" The killing was the result of a quarrel
over a horae trade. The negroes in the
community were greatly incensed against
Ashley and threats were made. A few
nights later some one attempted to enter
Ashley's house and was shot. Early in Au
gust Ella Ransom, sister of one of the
negroes lynched, told a story about hav
ing escaped from a crowd of white
men who were about to hang her.
This added to the trouble. Ashley's horses
were and A
guard had to be placed about his house
every night. Negroes rode about the
neighborhood armed with Winchesters and
trouble was momentarily looked for. Several
negroes have been taken out and
whipped and so it has gone on. In the
pocket of one of the dead men was found a
document supposed to be an oath, signed by
a number of negroes, in which they swore
to kill Ashley.
" Late last night a rumor reached the city
that the bodies of three more negroes had
been found in the woods. This story can
not be verified. The negroes are greatly
stirred up over the affair and more
trouble is serious

A LYNCHING PROMISED.
Cold Blooded Murder of a White Man
by a Negro Near Anchorage, Ky.
LOUISVILLE, May 4.- A negro murdered
a white man in cold blood near
Anchorage, fifteen miles from this city
and the neighbor
hood is worked up to the lynching point.
Frank Bellmann, a German, and Henry
Ready, a colored man, worked on Valentine
Hunz's farm, near Anchorage. On
account of the latter's mean temper they
got along badly from the first day they
met, six months ago. Last Friday Bell
mann told the owner of the farin that he
would quit if Ready was not discharged.
So the negro was paid off and told to
leave.
Monday afternoon Ready got half
drunk and went back to the farm.
Ready and Bellman met in the kitchen.
The German told the colored man to get
out of the house." I'll kill you,"
Ready replied, and he drew a pistol and
shot him through the heart. He then
walked over, and pulling open Bellman's
shirt, gazed with much interest at the
wound. I thought I had killed him,"
he said, and left. He has not been seen
since. There may be a lynching yet.
The murdered man has two
near Anchorage, who are well- to brothers- do.

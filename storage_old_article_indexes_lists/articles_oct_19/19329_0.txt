The first lynching of a negro by his own race in
this state, occurred Sundry night, at Moulton, Lawrence
county. Last Friday Calvin Moody, colored,
quarreled with his wife about some trifling matter.
He struck her on the head with a club, knocking
her down and then stabbed her several times with
a knife. He then dragged her into the woods
near his house, where she bled to
deaths. After she was dead he returned and covered
her body with leaves. Moody was arrested on
suspicion Saturday morning, and that afternoon his
wife's body was found. Sunday night about 200
armed negroes surrounded the jail. The sheriff and
a special guard were overpowered, and Moody was
soon in the hands of the mob. They carried him a
short distance. When the rope was thrown over the
limb he asked for a chance talk. It was granted,
and he made a full confession to of his crime.

Murder in Stewart County.
A murder of unusual atrocity is re
ported to us from Stewart county. An
old gentleman named McClish had
been reported missing since the middle
of last week; by degrees a suspicion
spread abroad that crime had
been the cause of his disappearance,
and a search was made for him, which
resulted on Saturday last, in the discovery
of his body about half a mile
from Dover on the road to Erin.
The scull had been cloven in two by
an axe and the throat cut very deeply
and widely. Murder had evidently
been committed. An old hat was
found near the spot which was identified
as the property of a negro in Do
ver, who on being arrested was found
to be wearing the hat of the deceased;
another negro was found wearing his
shoes. Both negroes confessed the
murder, which they admitted was for
the purpose of robbery, though little
so far as is known was taken from the
body, but it had been rumored that
MeClish had drawn a large sum of
money which report was doubtlessly
the temptation to the crime.
The neighborhood is intensely ex
cited in the matter and lynch- law was
loudly talked about. It is hoped
however, that the law will be allowed
to take its course- what that
will be seems to be beyond a doubt course.

fatally shot E. H. Wishart during the
afternoon. Wishart was hit four
bullets and a crowd of 500 people gath-
ered at the city hall when Pierce was
placed in jail. For three years Pierce
was the leader of the notorious Des
Moines searchers. He has shot several
persons in this city and on three occasions
mobs have been organized to lynch
him. Much excitement prevailed when
he was arrested, and cries of" bring a
rope" and" lynch him" were heard on
every hand. Forty policemen were
necessary to escort him to jail from the
buggy All is quiet now but the feel-
.,
ing is so strong against Pierce
trouble may come at any moment. that

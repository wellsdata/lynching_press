that brought his executioners nearer.
IN THE HANDS OF THE MOB.
At last the door was open. Then, with
one last yell of terror, the negro was seized
by the hands of men eager for his blood and
thrust through the corridor. Here men to
identify him were called for. It was deter
mined to make no mistake, Those who
knew him pressed forward, and his doom
was sealed. A lamb would have fared bet
ter amidst a pack of wolves. Coe was not
torn limb from limb, but he got a thousand
curses, and blows for every curse. There is
a driveway 100 yards long leading from
the jail to the intersection of Seventeenth
and Harney streets. This is paved with
granite. Over this rough road the wretch
was dragged by his ruthless captors. Since
he had reached the door he had not spoken
a word and in all probability was unconscious
, and by the time the street was
reached he was dead. It mattered not that
life was extinct. A rope was thrown over
the trolley wire of the electric line. It had
served to drag the doomed man from his
cell. Then a hundred hands pulled and a
hundred men surged back, and high above
the street, directly in front of the beautiful
new Bird's theatre, swung the lifeless corpse
of Omaha's latest rape fiend.
Joseph Newshoffer, who led the assault on
the jail, has been arrested and will be
charged with murder, the only Nebraska
statute covering& lynching
that as the charge. prescribing

REWARD FOR THE LYNCHERS.
DETERMINED TO BRING
GOVERNOR
THE GUILTY TO JUSTICE.
HAS CLEAR EVIDENCE AS TO THREE
Five Hundred Dollars Each for the First
Two Convicted; 8100 for Each Additional
Conviction Secured.
The governor of Georgia has offered
a reward for the Ryder lynchers and
the names of the most of them are in
his possession. He has clear evidence
as to three, and it is likely that evidence
as to the others will develop on
the trial. The governor offers rewards
as follows:
Five hundred dollars for the first
two lynchers of Dr. Ryder arrested
and convicted.
One hundred dollars for each subsequent
lyncher of Dr. Ryder arrested
and convicted.
Two hundred and fifty dollars for
each person arrested and convicted of
felonious conduct in preventing the
arrest or detection of parties guilty of
this crime.
This action
purtation, after an hour's hearing with
Dr. C. A. Ryder of Gainesville, and
Prof. R. A. Ryder of Columbus.
The brothers are determined and
will exert every effort to convict the
men who were concerned in the Talbot
county lynching.
Governor Atkinson was asked for an
expression of his views, and said:
" I am determined to do all that is
possible for the executive to do to
bring to justice the men who are guilty
of the murder of Ryder.
" There are two lines upon which we
must proceed in order to rid our
country of this practice which is injuring
alike the character of our people
and of our civilization.
" One is for the press, the pulpit and
all enlightened and patriotic citizens
to exert themselves to make such
offenses odious until right views are
recognized and conformed to by all
people,
Those who cannot be reached in
this way must be reached by being
made to feel the force of the strong
arm of the law. They should be
given to understand that when they
attempt to take a prisoner from the
hands of officers their own lives will
be forfeited by their effort, and that
in case of a successful effort they will
be punished by the courts.
There has been much said a out
the delays of the law, and yet to one
who fully comprehends our system and
its
consideration. We have now in our
penitentiary and county chaingangs
over We
large number hung during my administration
, and where there is an occasional
instance where a case is kept in
court a great while, it is a rare excep.
tion and not the rule.
" In addition to that, permit me to
say that the men who lynch and take
the lives of their fellow men in their
own hands are men who are
usually found on the side of law and
order, and if lynching be apologized
for on the ground that the law does
not conform to the views of everyone,
then there will never be a stop put to
it.
" This being true, let apology for
let it be condemned
in unmeasured terms, and whatever is
to be said about changing the law, let
it be said to the general assembly, and
not for the purpose of palliating a
crime lynchers are guilty of.
" I am satisfied that the good citizens
of Talbot county fully realize the
enormity of this offense and I expect
from them that hearty co- operation
which every good citizen owes to the
officers the law under which he
lives." of

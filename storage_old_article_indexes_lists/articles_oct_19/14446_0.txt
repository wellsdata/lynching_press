LARAMIE, Wyo., Aug. 29.- Joseph
Martin, colored, was lynched by a mob
of 30% men in front of Judge Carpenter's
house at 8 o'clock to- night.
Martin was a trusty in the County
Sail and attacked a white girl, Della
Krause, in the jail kitchen and slashed
er face and arms with a knife. One
man was wounded by Martin while the
mob was entering the jail to drag out
the prisoner.
After attacking Miss Krause with a
razor Martin was placed in a cell in
the County Jail. To- night a mob
formed outside the jail. The first intimation
that Sheriff Cook had of the
contemplated lynching was when two
masked men appeared in the kitchen
of the jail house and, with revolvers
leveled at him, told him that there
were 300 men waiting outside for the
negro and that he had better not at
tempt to make any trouble for them.
In the meantime another masked
man had entered and while the first
two held the Sheriff the third man
took the keys of the jail from the
Sheriff's pocket and then the three
started for the negro's cell. On the
way they met Turnkey Jones and Dr.
Miler, who had been summoned to
dress the wounds on Martin, self- inflicted
with the same razor he had
used in the attack on the girl. Both
were compelled to stand against the
cage of the cells, with their faces
turned away from the mob.
The negro was then taken from his
cell and hurriedly marched through the
court- house into the street. Arriving
at lamppost a short distance from
the gail the negro was quickly strung
up to the post. During the entire proceeding
he did not speak or attempt to
resist the mob. The lynching occurred
at about 8 o'clock and within an hour
dhe streets were deserted.
Acting Coroner Grant took charge
of the body of the negro and turned
it over to an undertaker.
Miss Krause undoubtedly would have
been killed by Martin had not the wife
of Sheriff Cook held him until his rage
had cooled and he could be taken from
the kitchen. On the way out he slash
ed Frank Frazer, a bystander, with a
butcher knife which he had seized from
the kitchen table. The wound is not
serious.
Miss Krause, who comes from
cothe, Mo., is not seriously wounded Chilli.

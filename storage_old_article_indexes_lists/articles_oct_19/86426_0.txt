MINISTERS DISCUSS LYNCHING.
Atlanta Lawyer Proposes to Call Convention
to Deal with the Subject.
Special to The Post.
Atlanta, Ga.,
ministers of the city, for the second time,
this morning refused to pass resolutions
condemning lynching. The first resolutions
were offered by Rev. J. T. Daves,
declaring that the crime of Hose was in
excusable, and that no punishment could
outweigh it, but at the same time refus-
ing to approve lynching. The other set
condemned the crime, but added nothing
either condemnatory or in favor of mob
violence. The ministers discussed these
two papers until they were all excited
and sorely wrought up, but compromised,
or at least decided not to commit them
selves, by tabling both.
Judge George Hillyer, a prominent barrister
of this city, has inaugurated a
movement to hold a convention in Atlanta
shortly, to be attended by delegates
from every county in the State, at which
the various phases of the lynching prob
lemn, and remedies therefor, will be dis
cussed. Judge Hillyer expresses himself
very strongly on the matter He declares
.
as a basic principle that" any one who
thinks assaults on women should be permitted
and nothing done about it has no
place in such a convention." He follows up
this remark by declaring that while there
,
can be no palliation of mob violence, at the
same time such legislation should be suggested
as will render the infraction of law
less probable or possible The press has
favorably commented on. the scheme.

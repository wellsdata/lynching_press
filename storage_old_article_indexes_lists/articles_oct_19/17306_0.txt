ESCAPE OF PRISONERS- LYNCHING.- On the
morning of the 31st ult., the staples were forced off the door
of the akland( â‚¬ al.) Jail by a party supposed to be Red
woods men, who captured two of the inmates- notorious
horse thieves- George Sheldon and Bob Parker. They immediately
proceeded to the bridge leading to Clinton, where
the mob hung George Sheldon upon a tree. Bob Parker
was set at liberty. These men had been arrested on the
29th by Officers Kellogg and Stoder, for stealing a horse from
Alderman Kelsey. They were tried before Judge Marier,
Justice of the Peace, and found guilty, when they were
bound over in the sum of$ 3,000 each, in default of which,
they were committed to the wooden prison of Oakland, from
which they were to have been conveyed to San Francis
co, for safe keeping. Great excitement exists among the people
, and a variety of opinion in relation to the doings of the
Redwood party. An inquest was held on the body of Shel
don, and the Jury rendered their verdict that the deceased
came to his death by being unlawfully hung by the neck, and
that the sald act was committed by a body of armed men un
known to the Jury..

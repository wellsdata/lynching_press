But further; the petition contains a gross
libel upon the colored people. They are not
" degraded below the condition of the whites,"
but on the contrary, the moral sentiment,
character, and condition of the negro is infinitely
superior to that of his oppressor. True,
you may find many degraded colored men,
especially in our large cities; but whites
will be found there who are even more degraded
. The great criminals of this land are
white, not colored men- the penitentiary
criminals we mean, for every one knows that
in fashionable scoundrelism, in popular ras
cality the colored man has no chance to com
white. Who is it burns Cath
pete with the
olic Convents, who fires Catholic churches,
who has done murder when Lynch law uttered
its mandate, who has filled every city
with mob violence defying the civil authorities
, who butcher each other with Bowie
knives and kill each other in duels? Is it the
white inan or the man who is so de
graded as to do these colored things?

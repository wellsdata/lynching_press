FATAL SHOOTING IN WICOMICO
COUNTY.
The Negro Twice Lynched.
A shooting affray which resulted fatally occurred
Saturday night about 10 o'clock at
Twiggs' Store, Wicomico county, Md.
Herman Kenny, 18 years old, was shot by
a negro named Garfield King. The shot
penetrated the abdomen and lodged some
where near the spine. Physicians were una
ble to locate it.
The story of the shooting as told by those
who saw it: Young Kenny, it is said, was in
the store, when a negro came in and brushed
against him in an insolent manner. The two
had some words, but Kenny did nothing, as
there were several negroes there and they are
known as a rather dangerous gang. A
moment later another negro who was outside
the door called Kenny a vile name and told
him to come outside and he would show him
what they would do for him. He went to the
door, and as soon as he was on the steps King
shot him. The negro's story, as told to the
reporter, is that when Kenny came outside he
struck him twice and he was compelled to
shoot him in self- defence.
Sheriff Dashield arrested King and took him
to jail.
THE LYNCHED.
About 1 a. m. on Thursday a demand was
made upon the Sheriff for King by a large
number of men, but he refused to give him
up. They soon found a telegraph pole, and
using that as a ram, the doors quickly gave
way. King was taken to a tree and hung up,
but the rope broke and he fell to the ground.
Again he was hung up and riddled with bullets
. The lynchers were not disguised. They
were from the neighborhood of the
and were friends of the young man. shooting

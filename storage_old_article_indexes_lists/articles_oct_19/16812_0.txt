HUNG FOR FUN.- The last Tennessee Re
view states that the grand jury County, Tenn.
has found a true bill against Geo. Smith, Johh
H. Tobb, Loftin Dake, James Pharce, and
Leroy Brown, for the murder of a slave be
longing to John Miller. They had all got in
to a drunken spree, and under the influence of
liquor, enticed the negro into a loft, and hung
him for fun, intending to cut him down in a
moment or two before life should be extinct.
Their drunken frolic was too far- the
negro died. carried

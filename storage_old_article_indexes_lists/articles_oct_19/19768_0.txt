turned and struck her a severe blow on
the head with an axe which he carried:
He then brutally outraged her, and
left her nearly
dead.- She was discovered half
an hour later and taken to her home
near by. The neighborhood was soon
aroused, and every able bodied man
in the vicinity turned out to hunt for
the villain. He ran to the woods, and
thence ventured to go to his home in

four grown up children. The Wheeler

of Eatontown, went to his home, about
9.30 o'clock last night, and after a severe
struggle bound the negro, and proceeded
towards the town jail in Eaton

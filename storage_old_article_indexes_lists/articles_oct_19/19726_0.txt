MONTGOMERY, Ala., Oct. 23.- News has
been received here of the lynching of three
negroes in Pickens county a few days ago.
A mob of seventeen white men took them
from the county jail, at Carrollton, and
hanged them to a tree at a grave yard in
the suburbs of the town. The negroes were
supposed to have burned a fine dwelling
house, the property of Mr. Amos Ball. The
mob accomplished their terrible purpose by
practicing deception upon Mr. Chapman, the
sheriff. They went to his office and pretended
they had a prisoner at the jail who had been
captured by them. The sheriff went to the
jail, as he supposed receive the
, to
captured prisoner. Once at the jail
the mob seized him and forced him to
open
the doors. Then they took the three negro
prisoners out and strung them up. The mob
were quiet, but did their work quickly and
in a determined way. The doomed negroes
gave no alarm, and the mob did not allow
the sheriff to speak a word. A number of
citizens went out to the grave- yard, where
the negroes were hanged, and found them all
dead. They were cut down, and a coroner's
jury held an inquest over their dead bodies.
The authorities failed to learn the names of
any who composed the mob and did the
wicced work, as the men were masked. The
affair caused considerable of a wave of excitement
in the neighborhood, and the only
reason why the facts have not leaked out be
fore is because Carrollton is a country town
and has railroad or telegraphic communication
with no the outside world.

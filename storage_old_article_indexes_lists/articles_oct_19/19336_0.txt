HIDING OUT FROM THE LYNCHERS.
PALEIGH, N. C., January 28 .-[ Special. 1
News has been received here of a terrible
lynching at the town of Plymouth, the county
seat of Washington county, night before last.
The mob, composed mainly of mounted men,
marched to the jail and took therefrom Patterson
Spruill, John Blount and Matthew
Blount, all colored. The doomed men were
taken to a piece of woods a mile from town,
and were tied to trees. The lynchers then
opened fire upon them with all sorts of weapons
, from Winchester rifles to shotguns, and
did not cease firing till all the men were dead
and riddled with bullets and shot. This lynch
ing is the result of a very brutal murder which
was] committed in the afternoon of
the 23d of last December. While
a man named Ed. Dawman, an
itinerant jeweler, was passing through
the country near the town of Creswell, four
negroes, three of whom were those lynched,
met him and presently knocked him in the
head, robbed him and threw the body in a
shallow pit, where a teamster discovered it,
seeing the knees sticking above the ground.
Christmas day all four men were arrested.
One confessed the crime. All were taken to
jail at Plymouth. Violence was feared, as
public feeling ran very high, and special pre
cautions were taken. The people in the sec
tion where the murder was committed, which
is some miles from Plymouth, were particularly
stirred up, and it is probable that they
were the lynching party. Everything was
conducted quietly and with system. The men
would have been tried for their lives at the
spring term of court. The evidence against
them was regarded as conclusive. It is
firstlynching in the state in many months. the

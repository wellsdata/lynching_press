LYNCH LAW- Five negroes were recently
hanged in Georgia, on suspicion of having
murdered a young man named Houston
No trial was had, no defence was heard: the
unfortunate men were executed without cere-
; mony and without pity. None of the parties
engaged in the outrage have been apprehen
;, ded. Such is slavery.

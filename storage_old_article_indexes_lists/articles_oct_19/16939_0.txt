From the Rio Grande.
The steamship Portland, Captain Place, arrived
at this port yesterday from Brazos St. Jago, which
place she left on the 3d inst.
ROBBERS ARRESTED.- We learn by the passengers
on the Portland, that the day they left
Brownsville, information was received there that
the Matamoros authorities had arrested two of the
ringleaders of the gang who have recently committed
so many robberies on the Point Isabel road.
The Mexican authorities have acted very well in
the matter. As there is no provision in the recent
treaty for the extradition of criminals, it was necessary
to devise some means by which the offen
ders might, on this occasion, be brought to justice.
The robbers were arrested by the Mexican authorities
under the vagrant act, and ordered to leave
the country immediately. They were accordingly
escorted to the river, and compelled to cross over
to Brownsville. There the sheriff was waiting
to receive them. The citizens of Brownsville were,
at last accounts, consulting as to the propriety of
administering Lynch law to the offenders: The
two men arrested were formerly attached to the
American army, and are known to be desperate
characters and to have committed robberies and
murders in different parts of Mexico.
The Portland brought$ 150,000 in specie, con
signed to order, and was hence detained at Brazos
one day over her time of sailing. There was difficulty
in getting the specice down from Browns
ville, as there is no boat running on the Rio Grande,
and the land route was hazardous, owing to
presence of robbers. the

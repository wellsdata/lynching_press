Colored men, when lynched, are worth
just$ 2 each in Kansas, according to the
verdict of a jury at Salina. Henry Adams,
colored, sued the city for$ 5,000 damages
for the loss of his son, who was hanged
by a mob last April. The matter came
before a court and jury last week, and the
jury decided that no actual damage had
been done, and that$ 2 was a bountiful
allowance for" nominal damages." This,
it will be borne in mind, was in the state of
Osawatomie John Brown, and of dema
gogues who are ever ready to go into
a convulsion of rage over the treatment
their colored brother
receives in the
south. But it will be observed that when
the harsh treatment of the colored brother
occurs in the hot- bed of the demagogues,
anger disappears and leaves in its
place their just$ 2 worth of sympathy. 1

he had concealed the bodies and they,86372_1.txt
were found at the place indicated.,86372_1.txt
In relating the occurrences that ended,86372_1.txt
in the murder he said that he had,86372_1.txt
given Church a bili of sale covering,86372_1.txt
personal property to secure payment,86372_1.txt
of$ 600 which Church had advanced,86372_1.txt
him. He claimed that he repaid,86372_1.txt
Church and had obtained return of,86372_1.txt
"the bill of sale, but Mrs. Church had",86372_1.txt
threatened him with a revolver and,86372_1.txt
demanded that he give the bill back.,86372_1.txt
He admitted that he shot the woman,86372_1.txt
and then being attacked by the,86372_1.txt
husband shot and killed him also.,86372_1.txt

General's office shows that there is no,86373_0.txt
excuse for these lynchings on the ground,86373_0.txt
that murderers or other criminals escape,86373_0.txt
"through the law. During the year, twenty",86373_0.txt
three prisoners have been tried for capita!,86373_0.txt
offences and condemned to death; and in,86373_0.txt
only two cases have there been commutations,86373_0.txt

"than was expected, although they have",86373_0.txt

No one could have been more earnest in,86373_0.txt
his efforts to break up lyneling in Missis-,86373_0.txt
sippi than Gov. Longino. He has discussed,86373_0.txt
it in every message to the Legislature,86373_0.txt
. He himself has gone to the county,86373_0.txt
seat when a lynching was expected. He,86373_0.txt
has ordered out troops whenever necessary,86373_0.txt
and has upheld and supported the Judges,86373_0.txt
in their opposition to mobs.,86373_0.txt
He did all in his power to secure action,86373_0.txt
by the Crand Juries against lynchers and,86373_0.txt
has worked in every possible way to stop,86373_0.txt
Yet he has at best saved,86373_0.txt

"proviously unknown in Mississippi, has",86373_0.txt
finally invaded the State and was the fear,86373_0.txt
ure of the recent Corinth lynching.,86373_0.txt
Theas who oppose lynching call attention,86373_0.txt
"to the fact that it is progressive, going",86373_0.txt
through an evolution of horrors. When,86373_0.txt
the mob first began this work in Mississippi,86373_0.txt
the lynching was done by a small body of,86373_0.txt
"men, well organized, masked and on horse",86373_0.txt
"back, who rode to the jail in the middle of",86373_0.txt
the night and compelled the Sheriff to,86373_0.txt
surrender the prisoner. He was taken to,86373_0.txt
the nearest tree and hanged.,86373_0.txt
"The next chang, a needlessly brutal",86373_0.txt
"one, was after hanging the negro to have",86373_0.txt
every momb r of the mob fira a rifle,86373_0.txt
or pistol at the body This practice has,86373_0.txt
"been kept up sine, with the result that the",86373_0.txt
bodies of lynched negroes to- day- nt lenst,86373_0.txt
been burned- sre,86373_0.txt
scare ly distinguisable fot as those of human,86373_0.txt
The more conservative citizens pleaded,86373_1.txt
"for a plain hanging"" and were regarded",86373_1.txt
as milksops for so doing.,86373_1.txt
No one seemed to plead law and order,86373_1.txt
for the trial and legal execution of the,86373_1.txt
criminal. The mob even took possession,86373_1.txt
"of the telegraph station, refused to allow",86373_1.txt
the Sheriff to telegraph to the Governor,86373_1.txt
"for troops, and refused to allow any word",86373_1.txt
of the lynching to go out until the work,86373_1.txt
was completed. It armed itself to resist,86373_1.txt
any troops that might be sent to the scene,86373_1.txt
to maintain the law.,86373_1.txt
It has been found that when burn ing,86373_1.txt
at the stake is once introduced as an incident,86373_1.txt
"to lynching, it is generally kept up.",86373_1.txt
The evil influence of the Corinth burning,86373_1.txt
was well shown in the very next lynching,86373_1.txt
"in Mississippi, at Darling, on All Saints",86373_1.txt
"Day, Nov. 1, when the negro victim was",86373_1.txt
burned at the stake.,86373_1.txt
"It will be seen, therefore, that lynchings",86373_1.txt
are going through an evolution which makes,86373_1.txt
them worse. The increased boldness of,86373_1.txt
the lyn hers wes well shown in the Hemp,86373_1.txt

street in the direction of the public,86399_0.txt

fore they hung him. Epithets and,86399_0.txt

LYNCH LAW NORTH AND SOUTH.,86402_0.txt
The Northern newspapers are coming,86402_0.txt
to the conclusion that a negro,86402_0.txt
criminal is in just as much danger of,86402_0.txt
being lynched in the North as in the,86402_0.txt
South. This statement is based upon,86402_0.txt
the comments of some of the Northern,86402_0.txt
papers on the recent lynching in,86402_0.txt
"Springfield, 0. In these comments it",86402_0.txt
is admitted that the lynchings are,86402_0.txt
based upon race hostility. White men,86402_0.txt
not,86402_0.txt
who commit similar crimes are,86402_0.txt
lynched.,86402_0.txt
that,86402_0.txt
And it is a safe proposition,86402_0.txt
white men in the North are just as,86402_0.txt
ready to lynch a negro as white men,86402_0.txt
in the South are. On Sunday a most,86402_0.txt
took place at,86402_0.txt
outrageous lynching,86402_0.txt
"Springfield, O. And the authorities",86402_0.txt
were not nearly so active and efficient,86402_0.txt
in their efforts to prevent the,86402_0.txt
outrage as is generally the case when,86402_0.txt
lynching is threatened in a Southern,86402_0.txt
state a.,86402_0.txt
Yesterday an attempt was made to,86402_0.txt
"lynch a negro at Murphysboro, Ill. It",86402_0.txt
was charged that he had attempted,86402_0.txt
to assault a woman. The officers dis,86402_0.txt
played more courage than was shown,86402_0.txt
"by the officers at Springfield, and the",86402_0.txt
mob dispersed. We have said,86402_0.txt
many,86402_0.txt
"times, and the foregoing cases justify",86402_0.txt
"us in repeating it, that the race",86402_0.txt
feeling at the North is just as strong,86402_0.txt
"as it is in the South, and that a negro",86402_0.txt
charged with a heinous offense is in,86402_0.txt
just as much danger of being lynched,86402_0.txt
in one section as in the other.,86402_0.txt
The,86402_0.txt
only reason more negroes are lynched,86402_0.txt
in the South than in the North is that,86402_0.txt
there are many times more negroes in,86402_0.txt
the South and they commit more offenses,86402_0.txt
of the kind that arouse the mob,86402_0.txt
spirit.,86402_0.txt
There is a steadily increasing negro,86402_0.txt
"population in many parts of the North,",86402_0.txt
and it is noticeable that wherever the,86402_0.txt
negro population is increasing in that,86402_0.txt
section the number of lynchings is,86402_0.txt
"increasing. Indeed, it is not too much",86402_0.txt
to say that if the percentage of the,86402_0.txt
negro population in the North were as,86402_0.txt
large as it is in the South there would,86402_0.txt
be more lynchings there than there,86402_0.txt
are here.,86402_0.txt
20.20.3.7.,86402_0.txt
The Northern people have it in their,86402_0.txt
"minds, however, that negroes are lynched",86402_0.txt
only in the South. It is about time,86402_0.txt
they admitted to themselves the truth.,86402_0.txt
The race feeling is even more strongly,86402_0.txt
developed among them than among,86402_0.txt
the people of the South. There will,86402_0.txt
be a steady increase in the number,86402_0.txt
"of negro lynchings in the North, and",86402_0.txt
the Northern people might as well,86402_0.txt
"admit now as later on, that they are",86402_0.txt
not in a position to condemn the people,86402_0.txt
of the South for lynching negroes.,86402_0.txt
Here in the South the press takes every,86402_0.txt
opportunity to condemn lynchings and,86402_0.txt
to urge that the law be permitted to,86402_0.txt
take its course. Almost without exception,86402_0.txt
"officers of the law, from the",86402_0.txt
"governors down to the sheriffs,",86402_0.txt
use,86402_0.txt
their utmost endeavors to prevent and,86402_0.txt
check lynchings. The Northern people,86402_0.txt
are having frequent opportunities,86402_0.txt
to prove they can do more to put a,86402_0.txt
stop to lynchings. The South,86402_0.txt
will give negro them credit for all they do.,86402_0.txt
SINCE several negroes were lynched and one,86403_0.txt
"burnt at the stake in the South during the past week,",86403_0.txt
the Northern press has been rather severe in ridiculing,86403_0.txt
the prevailing code of morals below the Mason and,86403_0.txt
Dixon line. The South has its shortcomings. So,86403_0.txt
has the North. It is incomprehensible to the South-,86403_0.txt
ern man's sense of justice when we sentence a man,86403_0.txt

hundred thousand a similar sentence. They cannot,86403_0.txt

down- town,86407_0.txt
harangued by several speakers who,86407_0.txt

He offered to let anybody whom he,86407_1.txt

to satisfy the crowd of the truth of his,86407_1.txt
statement. About forty men walked,86407_1.txt

commenced a fusillade. Not more,86407_1.txt
than a dozen men took part in the firing,86407_1.txt
and as the shots rang out there,86407_1.txt
was a stampede on the part of the,86407_1.txt
crowd for shelter. The mob was,86407_1.txt
widely scattered and in a few seconds,86407_1.txt
"Alderman I yons, who had been on the",86407_1.txt

But all and sundry persons must admit that startling and unlooked for,86470_0.txt
things are rapidly coming to pass these days. Last week it was Georgia,86470_0.txt
and now it's Oklahoma. Mob violence and lynching seems to have fallen,86470_0.txt
upon evil days even in the realm of its time tried and fire tested friends,86470_0.txt
and it would not be at all surprising to next hear of Texas or Florida or,86470_0.txt
the Carolina's catching step to the tune of a music somewhat new but,86470_0.txt
necessary.,86470_0.txt
A sheriff in Georgia prevented the lynching of a Negro at the expense,86470_0.txt
of the life of one of the would- be lynchers. Now comes the Governor of,86470_0.txt
Oklahoma who has found mob law so abhorrent during his short tenure,86470_0.txt
of office that he threatens to place the whole state under martial law for,86470_0.txt
the remaining three years of his term unless mob lawlessness ceases at,86470_0.txt
once.,86470_0.txt
The Oklahoma mob like all other mobs had reached the place where,86470_0.txt
it found ready victims in the white race and even descended to the level,86470_0.txt
of whipping children. Like its operations against the black brother in,86470_0.txt
"years past, and not so long ago either, a motive was not always needed to",86470_0.txt
start the mob on its way. Oklahoma mobs were of the mood that some,86470_0.txt
body had to be whipped just as it has followed its other bent that some,86470_0.txt
body had to be lynched. In overstepping the color line the mistake was,86470_0.txt
fatal. The Governor came forth in his majesty and power.,86470_0.txt
The whole state is to be placed under martial law for three years.,86470_0.txt
Certainly good news and if a few more states will only follow the lead of,86470_0.txt
Georgia and Oklahoma many of the ills that now afflict us will have faded,86470_0.txt

and was afterward taken to a room he had,86556_1.txt
previously engaged for the purpose of board,86556_1.txt

into the house with considerable effort by,86556_1.txt

"with oil and set on fire, both bodies being",86556_1.txt
disfigured by the flames nearly past recognition,86556_1.txt
. Near by in the bed room was the,86556_1.txt
"trunk above mentioned, and also the body of",86556_1.txt
"a woman recognized to be that of Mrs. Ford,",86556_1.txt
who was identified by her husband who soon,86556_1.txt
arrived. He remarked that it was his trunk,86556_1.txt
"and wheelbarrow, but requested that it remained",86556_1.txt
quiet. Bed clothes had been placed,86556_1.txt
on the body and saturated with oil. The,86556_1.txt
"can was found nearly empty, and an attempt",86556_1.txt
had been made to burn it. An examination,86556_1.txt
revealed that one leg had been chopped off,86556_1.txt
and the limbs bound to the body with a,86556_1.txt
clothes line. The particulars were gleaned,86556_1.txt
"from Mrs. Ruddy, who said that the crime",86556_1.txt
"was committed by Samon with a hatchet,",86556_1.txt
which has been found in the river. They,86556_1.txt
immediately commenced work on the case,86556_1.txt
"and men were sent in every direction to cap,",86556_1.txt
ture Samon.,86556_1.txt
"Coroner D. A. Ambrose of Merideth, arrived",86556_1.txt
"and held an inquest about noon, until",86556_1.txt
which time nothing was removed from the,86556_1.txt
house An immense,86556_1.txt
. throng,86556_1.txt
of people from,86556_1.txt
Laconia and adjoining towns visited the,86556_1.txt
scene during the day. Mrs. Ruddy's life being,86556_1.txt
"uncertain her deposition was taken, which",86556_1.txt
subsequently was as follows: All went to,86556_1.txt
bed about 9 o'clock. At 11 o'clock Samon,86556_1.txt
"came into the front room, went to the win",86556_1.txt
"dow, pulled the curtain one side and",86556_1.txt
looked out. He said he was,86556_1.txt
nervous and,86556_1.txt
could not sleep. She got up and made him,86556_1.txt
a cup of tea and went back to bed. At 4,86556_1.txt
o'clock Samon came into the front room,86556_1.txt
"again, looked out the window and went back",86556_1.txt
into the kitchen. My husband and I got up.,86556_1.txt
He went into the kitchen also. I soon heard,86556_1.txt
"a fall, and going out found my husband hanging",86556_1.txt
over a chair with his arms down. Samon,86556_1.txt
started for me and struck at me with a,86556_1.txt
"hatchet, striking me on the head. I grabbed",86556_1.txt
"his arm, but he struck me and threw me",86556_1.txt
on,86556_1.txt
the floor. He then went into the front room,86556_1.txt
and killed the baby. The baby was crying,86556_1.txt
quite loud. While he was there I tried to,86556_1.txt
"unlock the door, but he was back and struck",86556_1.txt
"me on the head again, knocking me down. I",86556_1.txt
laid perfectly quiet. He then went back into,86556_1.txt
"the front room, got the baby and had come",86556_1.txt
back pouring feathers and straw over us and,86556_1.txt
going out. I got up and went to the front,86556_1.txt
"window, tried to get it up but could not.",86556_1.txt
I,86556_1.txt
then broke a pane of glass and jumped,86556_1.txt
"through. He was very nervous, walking in",86556_1.txt
the kitchen nearly all night. I did not know,86556_1.txt
but the trunk was all right.,86556_1.txt
The coroner's inquest was that the persons,86556_1.txt
came to their death by the hands of Thomas,86556_1.txt
Samon. Where she jumped through the,86556_1.txt
front window and outside were spattered,86556_1.txt
"with bood. Suspicion being against Ford,",86556_1.txt
"husband of the murdered woman, that he",86556_1.txt
"might be implicated in the affair, he was arrested",86556_1.txt
early this morning and still remains,86556_1.txt
in custody. He shows evidence of guilt. He,86556_1.txt
called,86556_1.txt
at neighbor's house,86556_1.txt
last,86556_1.txt
and,86556_1.txt
"evening, leaving the",86556_1.txt
family,86556_1.txt
"bible,",86556_1.txt
remarking that his wife had,86556_1.txt
"gone away with another man, and wished",86556_1.txt
"that they should keep the bible till called for,",86556_1.txt
and if his wife should come and attempt to,86556_1.txt
sell the household goods to immediately let,86556_1.txt
him know.,86556_1.txt
Mrs. Ruddy's injuries consisted of a cut,86556_1.txt
"nearly severing the left wrist, cutting off the",86556_1.txt
"finger and ugly wounds upon the face, neck and",86556_1.txt
back. At Ford's and Samon's there was,86556_1.txt
"no evidence of the murder of Mrs. Ford, yet",86556_1.txt
it is thought that her death was accidental at,86556_1.txt
"the hands of Samon, and that wishing to conceal",86556_1.txt
the body he took it down stairs in a,86556_1.txt
"trunk and thence to Ruddy's and thinking,",86556_1.txt
"perhaps, that he could carry it from the",86556_1.txt
house during the night. Ruddy refused to,86556_1.txt
aid him. When the struggle commenced at,86556_1.txt
five o'clock in the morning another tenant of,86556_1.txt
the Ford and Samon house heard,86556_1.txt
and afterwards loud words which soon rapping sub- 1,86556_1.txt
sided. Friday Mrs. Ford informed her husband,86556_1.txt
that he need not return from Lake Village,86556_1.txt
"that night, a request which he seemed",86556_1.txt
ready to comply with. The supposition is,86556_1.txt
that Mrs. Ford died from strangulation or,86556_1.txt
"being drugged, as she frequently indulged in",86556_1.txt
strong drink. The murderer was captured,86556_1.txt
at two o'clock this afternoon a short distance,86556_1.txt
from Plymouth village on the main road,86556_1.txt
"from Laconia, about 30 miles from the scene",86556_1.txt
of the murder. He was passed by a team occupied,86556_1.txt
"by Manson Brown of Plymouth, who,",86556_1.txt
"upon going to the telegraph office, learned of",86556_1.txt
"the affair with a description of the villian,",86556_1.txt
when it occured to him that he had passed,86556_1.txt
such a person and going back took Samon into,86556_1.txt
custody. Upon notifying Sheriff Story he,86556_1.txt
was ordered to place him in the hands of the,86556_1.txt
"Plymout officers, where he will remain till",86556_1.txt
Monday and then taken to Laconia for,86556_1.txt
trial. Great excitement prevails and fears,86556_1.txt
are entertained that a vigilence committee,86556_1.txt
will be organized and upon the arrival of the,86556_1.txt
murder be lynched. Later reports from Ply-,86556_1.txt
mouth etate that Samon denies anything,86556_1.txt
about the tragedy and is surprised at his,86556_1.txt
"arrest, yet there is not the least doubt of his",86556_1.txt
guilt.,86556_1.txt
A reward of$ 300 was offered by the select,86556_1.txt
men for Samon's arrest. At 7 o'clock this,86556_1.txt
"evening, Samon was eating supper with his",86556_1.txt
"wife at Little's Hotel in Plymouth, apparently",86556_1.txt
unconcerned. Many are of the opinion that,86556_1.txt
"he will be brought down during the night,",86556_1.txt
but the sheriff claims he will not.,86556_1.txt
Great crowds are anxiously awaiting his,86556_1.txt
return. Ford is at present under bonds to,86556_1.txt
keep the peace for shooting at some boys a,86556_1.txt
"year ago, and is generally called rather a",86556_1.txt
hard character. Samon has never been regarded,86556_1.txt
"as vicious, even when drunk. Mrs.",86556_1.txt
"Ford was formerly the widow of Wm. Scales,",86556_1.txt
who died some years ago leaving her in comfortable,86556_1.txt
An axe was found in the sink in Ford's,86556_1.txt
"house, but no traces of blood. A hatchet",86556_1.txt
"was also fouud in Ruddy's house, but the one",86556_1.txt
used by Samon was found in the river on the,86556_1.txt
way to Plymouth.,86556_1.txt
At 8 o'clock Samon was reported to be in,86556_1.txt
bed asleep under the guard of two men.,86556_1.txt

LYNCHING AS A HABIT,86579_0.txt
The records of lynchings in the United States last,86579_0.txt
"year, as compiled by the Tuskegee Institute, is not a",86579_0.txt
"thing to be proud of. In 1918, sixty- two persons were",86579_0.txt
"assassinated in this way, fifty- eight of them being",86579_0.txt
"Negroes and five of them women. Of the total, six",86579_0.txt
teen were killed because they were accused of crimes,86579_0.txt
against women. Fourteen were accused of complicity,86579_0.txt
"in murder, seven of murder, and six of using",86579_0.txt
threats to murder. The total was an increase of,86579_0.txt
"twenty- four over 1917, and all but three of the out",86579_0.txt

These figures give every American something to,86579_0.txt
"think about. In the beginning, lynching was theoretically",86579_0.txt
resorted to in the south as a retaliation for,86579_0.txt
one offense against society. But the Tuskegee report,86579_0.txt

to indicate that in the districts where nearly,86579_0.txt
all the killings occurred. lynch law is bearing its,86579_0.txt
natural fruit. What was once excused as an extra,86579_0.txt
ordinary proceeding to prevent the commission of a,86579_0.txt
peculiarly heinous offense has become a convenient,86579_0.txt
medium for the gratification of savage revengefulness,86579_0.txt
and barbarous impulse. It has grown to be one of,86579_0.txt
the diversions of the population and obviously is not,86579_0.txt
resorted to in the great majority of cases because,86579_0.txt
there is any feeling that the law will lag or inflict in,86579_0.txt
"adequate penalties, but because the populace prefers",86579_0.txt

Nethaway.,86819_0.txt
Nethaway's theatrical and spectacular,86819_0.txt
actions the last two years have,86819_0.txt
been a matter in which newspapers,86819_0.txt
interested themselves very much. To,86819_0.txt
a certain extent there has been a,86819_0.txt
popular prejudice against him which,86819_0.txt
the general public has not been able,86819_0.txt
to cast aside. Despite the conviction,86819_0.txt
of the Negro who was charged with,86819_0.txt
"the slaying of his wife, there have",86819_0.txt
been open charges that he was not,86819_0.txt
guilty and that Nethaway himself,86819_0.txt
knew more about the matter than he,86819_0.txt
has told.,86819_0.txt
These facts have been cited during,86819_0.txt
the trial and hints by Nethaway's attorneys,86819_0.txt
that a fair trial for him was,86819_0.txt
impossible have been heard. The result,86819_0.txt
of the trial will have an import,86819_0.txt
ant bearing on other cases to be tried,86819_0.txt
for similar offenses.,86819_0.txt
The lynching was of an unprecedented,86819_0.txt
sort and even those who were,86819_0.txt
not particularly interested in the fate,86819_0.txt
"of Negro Brown, have felt that drastic",86819_0.txt
action to prevent,86819_0.txt
was necessary,86819_0.txt

NON- CONVICTION OF RIOTERS,86819_1.txt

of the sympathy of many of the onlookers,86819_1.txt
"and bystanders, who would be",86819_1.txt
"unwilling and reluctant witnesses,",86819_1.txt
and because of the further fact that,86819_1.txt

"We, however, stated that despite the",86819_1.txt
"difficulty of securing testimony, we",86819_1.txt
believed that every participant and,86819_1.txt

"case of Snyder, the jury after long",86819_1.txt

"acquittal on the major charge, although",86819_1.txt
he is still held for trial on,86819_1.txt
"the charge of rioting; in that of Davis,",86819_1.txt
the jury after being out for more,86819_1.txt
than two days and standing nine for,86819_1.txt

Nethaway were remanded for a new,86819_1.txt
"trial, that of Davis being in process",86819_1.txt
as we go to press.,86819_1.txt
The prosecution of all these cases,86819_1.txt

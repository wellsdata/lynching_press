ga cant find lynchers
The Georgia state police announced to the nation, Tuesday that
they have run into" a stone wall" in the attempt to apprehend the
murderers of the four Negroes at Monroe, Ga., last week. They just
can't find out a single thing, the boys lament to the
country's press.
Read this reprint from a story carried in last
Sunday's edition of New York newspaper PM, written
by reporter Tom O'Connor who was sent to Monroe to
cover the slaying:
" I have just seen the first proof of Eugene Tal-
madge's election as Governor of Georgia. I saw it in
the basement of Dan Young's funeral parlor( for
colored) here in Monroe.
" An embalmer was sewing up bullet holes in one
of the girls, Dorothy Malcolm. He had already done
his best to patch up the rifle and pistol bullet holes in
the other girl and the two fellows lynched here Thurs-

day night.

MARKS, Miss., June 15.-In spite of President Roosevelt's
admonition to the people of the United States that mass murder
must cease, the state of Mississippi continued its mob justice
by lynching two more boys Friday afternoon.
The youths, Joe Love and Isaac

homeless, were taken from

"And the case," wired Sheriff W, T.

plained further that he could recox-

clemency for lynchers?

in the cases of the six East Point (Ga) floggers,

stated by the late Booker T. Washington years ago
that beatings and lynching of Negroes would inev-
stably lead to beatings and lynching of white men.
A perfect example of the truth

in the cases of these men, facing
comparatively brief terms, but who

The Pickens County Lynching Pickens County Lynching
(From The Lighthouse And Informer) From The Lighthouse And Informer)
Monday morning, South Carolina and the rest of the i
country, set to begin "Brotherhood Week", awoke to find
the brutal lynching of a Pickens County Negro at the hands
of an estimated 35 white men.
Saturday night, near Liberty in Pickens County, a
white taxi driver of Greenville was beaten and robbed by a
colored fare and authorities arrested 35-year-old Willie
Earle of Liberty as a suspect and placed him in the county
jail at Pickens. pending further investigation.
Around 5 A. M. Monday, an armed mob arrived at the
little red jail house at Pickens and at gun point forced
Jailer Ed Gilstrap to surrender the prisoner, locked in a sec-
ond floor cell. About. seven o'clock the stabbed and shot
body of Earle was found just over the Pickens line in
Greenville County



extreme lynching violence
LYNCHERS THE OF LUST THE
We used to speak of epidemics of lynching, when that barbarous practice
received some unusual impetus and seemed to show evidence of contagion
. The expression granted the existence of a moral and social weakness
which would yield to scientific treatment, but the recent revival of the
scourge in its most virulent form indicates that its seat in the white man's
nature is of a mental rather than a physical character. Oklahoma's recent
disgrace, through the ruthless murder of a colored woman and her child by
a jelly- brained mob, has been quite surpassed in Pennsylvania, where a
wounded Negro prisoner, chained to a hospital cot, was carried and dragged.
cot and all, over several miles of road, and thrown into a blazing fire, where,
against his struggles to liberate himself from his chains, he was kept in
place and in fiery torment with fence rails, pitch- forks and other improvised
prods and tongs. His crime was attempted robbery and the killing of a
white officer undertaking his arrest. His punishment was far beyond the
revenge of the savage.

In the wake of gruesome lynchings, entailing such weird prac-
tices as vivisection, castration, burnings and beatings, comes to the
light," the tale of Death Farm." The Death Farm is located in Jasper
County, Georgia, abutting the Yellow River. There it lies in the red
hills, where scores of black people have been and are still held in
slavery. There they are forced to work and toil under the pitiless
lash of the mule- driving overseer. When the task of the farm became
irksome to the human beasts of burden and they either lagged

of the crimes
Many of us object to the harrowing exposures
committed in the Southland. Some are heard to exclaim that they
get tired of reading about the maltreatment and lynching of their
people. Others exclaim that our newspapers aggravate the conditions
and cause unnecessary alarm to the public Such objections
are foolish and do not hold water..

president pleas for end of lynching
THE" BOCHES" IN GEORGIA
O In spite of the direct personal pleading of President Wilson to the
white Americans, that they would everywhere uphold and respect the
majesty of the law, and stop the damnable savage pastime of the white
South- the lynching of human beings; there still remains, everywhere in
Dixie a cowardly gang of white men, under disguise of loyal and patriotic
citizens, who continue to mob helpless members of the Race. This week,
a gang of these savage white cattle, down in old hell- ridden Georgia, at
Macon, the hot- bed for" red- necks,"" hill billies"" red shirts" and" crackers",
a member of the Race, ALLEGED to have committed a serious crime in the
community, was lynched by a mob of white men.
President Wison said such persons who would so mock the principles
for which America is fighting, as to join a mob to lynch a human being,
was unworthy of the citizenship of America. But old polluted Georgia, the

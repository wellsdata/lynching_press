PECULIAR VI W OF MOB LAW,19408_0.txt
In the house of representatves yesterday,19408_0.txt
", Mr. Spight of Mississippi dis",19408_0.txt
cussed the lynchings with which the,19408_0.txt
"country, unhappily, has been so much",19408_0.txt
affected of recent years. One part o,19408_0.txt
his remarks may well cause astonishment,19408_0.txt
", comments the Salt Lake Tribune",19408_0.txt
. We refer to that portion of his,19408_0.txt
speech in which he claimed that the,19408_0.txt
"people of the south"" do not wreak indiscriminate",19408_0.txt
vengeance upon the innocent,19408_0.txt
because they belong to the same,19408_0.txt
"race as the criminal,"" his contention",19408_0.txt
being that mobs in the north do this.,19408_0.txt
He was speaking especially of the,19408_0.txt
"mobbings of negroes, and his charge",19408_0.txt
in this regard upon the people of the,19408_0.txt
north was quite true. The blood lust,19408_0.txt
once aroused is not sated by the death,19408_0.txt
"of the assumed criminal, but the mob",19408_0.txt
does turn against the negroes as a,19408_0.txt
race. This was plainly shown by the,19408_0.txt
"riots at Springfield, Ohio, and it has",19408_0.txt
been the same at other places and,19408_0.txt
times.,19408_0.txt
But the south is not exempt,19408_0.txt
from precisely the same tendency.,19408_0.txt
"In the riots at Danville Virginia, the",19408_0.txt
mob met a negro and strung him up,19408_0.txt
merely because he was a negro. It is,19408_0.txt
often the same; the negro is hunted,19408_0.txt
down merely because of the color of,19408_0.txt
his skin. The dispatches frequently,19408_0.txt
"give instances of this, south as well as",19408_0.txt
"north. Indeed, the most atrocious case",19408_0.txt
of the that has come under public,19408_0.txt
notice kind this year took place in Repre,19408_0.txt
"sentative Spight's own state, and must",19408_0.txt
have been familiar to him when he was,19408_0.txt
drawing his unfavorable contrast be,19408_0.txt
tween the south and the north.,19408_0.txt
"A negro, Louis Holbert, got into a",19408_0.txt
fight with a white man; they exchanged,19408_0.txt
"shots, and the white man was killed",19408_0.txt
The negro fled. His wife fled with him:,19408_0.txt
she evidently did not share Mr,19408_0.txt
Spight's cheerful sentiment that southerners,19408_0.txt
do not visit indiscriminate vengeance,19408_0.txt
upon the innocent. The event,19408_0.txt
showed that her fears were right,19408_0.txt
though she had nothing whatever to,19408_0.txt
do with the quarrel. The fugitives were,19408_0.txt
overtaken and tied to trees; nameless.,19408_0.txt
them.,19408_0.txt
atrocities were inflicted upon,19408_0.txt
that exceeded even the ingenuity of,19408_0.txt
savages whose burnings of white captives,19408_0.txt
at the stake have served as pat,19408_0.txt
terns of merciless atrocity.,19408_0.txt
In this case the man had committed,19408_0.txt
"no atrocious offense, from the southern",19408_0.txt
point of view; street fights in which,19408_0.txt
one man kills another being so fre ..,19408_0.txt
quent as not to be considered especially,19408_0.txt
out of the no,19408_0.txt
way. It was case,19408_0.txt
such as is usually pleaded in extenuation,19408_0.txt
of the lynching of negroes in the,19408_0.txt
south. The woman was innocent of all,19408_0.txt
offense; she merely fled in terror with,19408_0.txt
husband.,19408_0.txt
her It was no doubt the horror awakened,19408_0.txt
by this awful case in his state that,19408_0.txt
caused Governor Vardaman to take,19408_0.txt
personal charge when next a negro,19408_0.txt
threatened. He went,19408_0.txt

"negro, conveyed him in his own ca",19408_0.txt
"to the capital of the state, and the",19408_0.txt
accused will have a lawful trial.,19408_0.txt
Governor Vardaman deserves praise,19408_0.txt
"for this, and for waking up to his duty",19408_0.txt
in view of the atrocious nature of the,19408_0.txt
forever,19408_0.txt

stand an indelible stain upon the good,19408_0.txt

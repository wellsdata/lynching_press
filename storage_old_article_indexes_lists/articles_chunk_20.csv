this time the Northern press spoke in defense of the Negro,90119_0.txt

Thus,90119_0.txt
and were engaged in many pursuits of commerce.,90119_0.txt
situated they invited race hatred until lynching became,90119_0.txt

as it affects the Negro race. This bill is known,90119_0.txt
"as the Dyer Bill and, thank God, it has passed the House,",90119_0.txt
and may we all pray that it will meet the approval of the,90119_0.txt

tude. The turnkey was overpowered,90174_0.txt
and his keys taken from him.,90174_0.txt
"By that time excitement was intense,",90174_0.txt
none less so when a patrol wagon drove,90174_0.txt
"up with a detachment of police, who",90174_0.txt
were driven away under a fire of mud,90174_0.txt
and stones.,90174_0.txt
When the leaders inside got possession,90174_0.txt
of the keys the doors were easily,90174_0.txt
unlocked. The door of the first cell was,90174_0.txt
opened. A group of trembling prisoners,90174_0.txt
stood inside. They were not the men,90174_0.txt
who were wanted and the crowd burst,90174_0.txt
into the yard.,90174_0.txt
Peering through the bars of a condemned,90174_0.txt
cell was a terror- stricken face,90174_0.txt
who some mistook for Scaffedi. A volley,90174_0.txt
"was fired at the man and he dropped,",90174_0.txt
but none of the shots struck him and it,90174_0.txt
was subsequently found he was not one,90174_0.txt
of the assassins.,90174_0.txt
The inmates of the jail were ready to,90174_0.txt
direct the way to where the men were.,90174_0.txt
"Arriving at the female ward, the door",90174_0.txt
was locked. In a moment a key was,90174_0.txt
produced. Then the leader called for,90174_0.txt
some one who knew the right men. A,90174_0.txt
volunteer responded and the door was,90174_0.txt
"thrown open. The gallery was deserted,",90174_0.txt
but an old woman said the men were,90174_0.txt
up- stairs. The crowd quickly ascended,90174_0.txt
the stairs and as they reached the landing,90174_0.txt
", the assassins fled down at the other",90174_0.txt
end. Half a dozen followed them.,90174_0.txt
Scarcely a word was spoken.,90174_0.txt
When pursued and pursuers reached,90174_0.txt
"the stone courtyard, the former darted",90174_0.txt
toward the Orleans side of the gallery,90174_0.txt
and in fear and trembling they screamed,90174_0.txt
"for mercy, but the avengers were",90174_0.txt
less. Bang! bang! bang! rang out merci- the,90174_0.txt
bullets was poured into the crouching,90174_0.txt

figures.,90174_0.txt
"Gerachi, the closest man, was struck",90174_0.txt
in the back of the head and his body,90174_0.txt
pitched forward.,90174_0.txt
"Romero fell on his knees, with his",90174_0.txt
"face in his hands, and in that position",90174_0.txt

under the fire of a half,90174_0.txt

When the group of assassins was discovered,90174_0.txt
"on the gallery, Macheca, Scoffedi",90174_0.txt
and old man Marchesi separated from,90174_0.txt
the other six and ran up stairs. Thither,90174_0.txt
"a half dozen men followed, and as the",90174_0.txt
terror- stricken assassins ran into cells,90174_0.txt
they were slain.,90174_0.txt
Joe Macheca had his back turned,90174_0.txt
when shot.,90174_0.txt
"Scoffedi, one of the most villainous of",90174_0.txt
"the murderers, dropped like a log when",90174_0.txt
a bullet hit him in the eye,90174_0.txt
Politz was locked up in. a cell up,90174_0.txt
stairs. The doors were flung open and,90174_0.txt
"one of the avengers, taking aim, shot",90174_0.txt
him through the body. He was not,90174_0.txt
"killed, and, in order to satisfy the people",90174_0.txt
"on the outside, who were crazy to know",90174_0.txt
"what was going on, he was dragged",90174_0.txt
"down stairs. Half carried, half dragged,",90174_0.txt
"he was taken to a corner, a rope was",90174_0.txt
provided and tied around his neck and,90174_0.txt
the people pulled him up to the crossbars,90174_0.txt
". Not satisfied with that, a score of",90174_0.txt
men poured a volley of shots into his,90174_0.txt
body. For several hours the body was,90174_0.txt
left dangling in the air.,90174_0.txt
Just as soon as the bloody work was,90174_0.txt
"done, Mr. Parkerson asked the crowd to",90174_0.txt
"disperse. They consented to do so and,",90174_0.txt
"with a ringing cheer, lifted Parkerson",90174_0.txt
on their shoulders and marched down,90174_0.txt

The indignation and excitement was,90174_2.txt
such that mob law and lynching were,90174_2.txt
about to be resorted to. The entire,90174_2.txt
community felt that in the endeavor to,90174_2.txt

Argument was heard before the Supreme,90204_0.txt

of a sheriff from office without a,90204_0.txt
hearing if a prisoner is taken from him,90204_0.txt
and killed by a mob. The sheriff's counsel,90204_0.txt
argued that as the office of sheriff was a,90204_0.txt
constitutional office he could only be removed,90204_0.txt
after a judicial hearing.,90204_0.txt

"cries of"" lynch him,"" and City Attorney",90235_0.txt
Decker mounted the jail and,90235_0.txt
steps,90235_0.txt
made a strong plea in behalf of law,90235_0.txt
and order. This served to temporarily,90235_0.txt
"stay the mob, but did not appease it,",90235_0.txt
and a short time after Decker's speech,90235_0.txt
the mob started in to batter in the,90235_0.txt

to prevent the entrance of the mob,90235_0.txt

that the negro be given a trial and for,90235_0.txt
an hour he spoke and the mob listened,90235_0.txt

At one time it seemed that the city,90235_0.txt
"attorney would win, as members of the",90235_0.txt

rush was made for the spot where the,90235_0.txt
"negro was being held, and he was dragged",90235_0.txt
"two blocks from the jail, a rope",90235_0.txt
"fastened around his neck, and after the",90235_0.txt

attempted to pull the negro from the,90235_0.txt
ground.,90235_0.txt
As many more seized the negro and,90235_0.txt
pulled to prevent him from being hanged,90235_0.txt
. For some moments it was a veritable,90235_0.txt

swung into the air and strangled to,90235_0.txt

"groes, and finally drove every negro",90235_0.txt
from the confines of Joplin. The pelice,90235_0.txt

the negroes were driven from all parts,90235_0.txt

and winodws of negro houses were,90235_0.txt
broken in and finally several houses,90235_0.txt

to the ground. The mot made endeavors,90235_0.txt
to prevent the fire department,90235_0.txt

were partially successful. All the officers,90235_0.txt

THE MAFIA,90355_0.txt
It is close to twenty- three years,90355_0.txt
ago that the death knell of the Mafia,90355_0.txt
"in America was sounded, rung by",90355_0.txt
the best citizens of New Orleans in,90355_0.txt
their fury of what they believed was,90355_0.txt
a miscarriage of justice. This organization,90355_0.txt
was originally a political,90355_0.txt
"one in Italy, but in this country it",90355_0.txt
had degenerated into a band of assassins,90355_0.txt
". New Orleans, in a measure,",90355_0.txt
"was its headquarters, and this city",90355_0.txt
found the most difficulty in its suppression,90355_0.txt
", and it was the people and",90355_0.txt
not the law that brought it about.,90355_0.txt
The means to the end of the organization,90355_0.txt
was the murder of Chief,90355_0.txt
of Police David C. Hennessy of New,90355_0.txt
"Orleans. The Mafia, or rather the",90355_0.txt
"Stopaghera, the proper name of the",90355_0.txt

"Italians, mostly Sicilian by birth,",90355_0.txt
their early leader having been Giu-,90355_0.txt

"made, for so secretly did the body",90355_0.txt
work that it was impossible to detect,90355_0.txt
them.,90355_0.txt
The capture of the brigand Espo-,90355_0.txt
"sito in 1881, and his surrender to the",90355_0.txt
"Italian government, resulted in several",90355_0.txt
killings. The Stopagherra determined,90355_0.txt
to avenge the killing of their,90355_0.txt
comrade. Engrossed in his search to,90355_0.txt
weed out this murde: ous organiza-,90355_0.txt
"tion, Chief of Police Hennessy had",90355_0.txt
no idea that he was being watched.,90355_0.txt
He probably knew nothing of a certain,90355_0.txt
"Italian neighbor of his, Monas-",90355_0.txt
"terio by name, lately arrived from",90355_0.txt
fifty,90355_0.txt
"abroad, occupying a shanty",90355_0.txt
yards from his house.,90355_0.txt
It was nearly time for Hennessy,90355_0.txt
to spring the trap and to make a,90355_0.txt
"full exposure, when late one evening,",90355_0.txt
"he drew near home, a boy ran in",90355_0.txt
as front of him and gave a peculiar,90355_0.txt
Whistle. The next moment the chief,90355_0.txt
was a dying man. Bullets tore three,90355_0.txt
"cruel rents in his abdomen, his right",90355_0.txt
knee and his left hand were shot,90355_0.txt
"through, and his face, arms and neck",90355_0.txt
were frightfully mutilated.,90355_0.txt
Within ten minutes of the shooting,90355_0.txt
the immigrant was seized in his,90355_0.txt
"shanty. Other arrests followed, but",90355_0.txt
only eleven were held and only nine,90355_0.txt
finally prosecuted. The trial proved,90355_0.txt
that Hennessy's assassins hid in Mo-,90355_0.txt
nasterio's cottage and that an Italian,90355_0.txt
boy was posted to notify them of,90355_0.txt
Hennessy's approach. The deadly,90355_0.txt
"weapons were found, five with barrels",90355_0.txt
sawed off and stocks hinged so,90355_0.txt
that they could be doubled up and,90355_0.txt
carried under the clothing.,90355_0.txt
Hennessy had been murdered on,90355_0.txt
"October 15, 1890, and the Italians",90355_0.txt

Awaiting a trial upon a second indictment,90355_0.txt
and joyfully reckoning upon,90355_0.txt
"a similar result next time, the accused",90355_0.txt
were again locked in their,90355_0.txt
cells. At the moment the doors closed,90355_0.txt
behind them a vigilance committee of,90355_0.txt
well known citizens was writing a,90355_0.txt
I call for a mass meeting for the following,90355_0.txt

The assemblage was so,90355_0.txt
this meeting that it blocked the,90355_0.txt
street cars and climbed upon them.,90355_0.txt
What was the outcome of this meeting,90355_0.txt
? The citizens took the law in,90355_0.txt
their own hands. A mob- but in,90355_0.txt
good order- started for the Parish,90355_0.txt
"prison, where the prisoners were",90355_0.txt
confined. They battered down the,90355_0.txt
doors. Nine of the prisoners were,90355_0.txt
put to death in various ways by the,90355_0.txt
mob and two of them were hanged,90355_0.txt

Thep ress,90355_0.txt
nounced the verdict and declared that,90355_0.txt
the jury had been bought. The grand,90355_0.txt
"jury, even on the day of the killing,",90355_0.txt
had found indictments against two,90355_0.txt

the jury. The jurors did not appre-,90355_0.txt
the,90355_0.txt
ciate the public sentiment on,90355_0.txt
outside and were surprised at the,90355_0.txt
popular indignation. The trial of the,90355_0.txt
case had cost the city more than,90355_0.txt
"$ 30,000 and then was a miscarriage",90355_0.txt
of justice.,90355_0.txt
The incident opened grave international,90355_0.txt
complications which Secretary,90355_0.txt
Blaine handled with skill. Twenty-,90355_0.txt

The Charge of Criminal Assault as an Excuse,87373_0.txt
for Lynchings and the Record.,87373_0.txt
Gov. Atkinson of Georgia has been persistent,87373_0.txt
"in his opposition to mob law, all through his",87373_0.txt
"first term, and in his second term, which he is",87373_0.txt
"now serving, he has undoubtedly done a great",87373_0.txt
deal toward curbing the excesses of the mob,87373_0.txt
spirit in his State. He deserves well of the,87373_0.txt
people of Georgia and of the whole country,87373_0.txt
for the unyielding stand he has always taken for,87373_0.txt
the orderly enforcement of the laws. Those,87373_0.txt
who are familiar with the conditions and the,87373_0.txt
temper of the people of Georgia appreciate at,87373_0.txt
its full value the service he has rendered. It,87373_0.txt
is a position not easily taken and maintained,87373_0.txt
in such an atmosphere by a young and ambitious,87373_0.txt
man. He has had to encounter fierce opposition,87373_0.txt
"from leaders and masses, but instead of",87373_0.txt
"diminishing, it has rather intensified his zeal.",87373_0.txt
In his annual message to the Legislature a,87373_0.txt
short time ago Gov. Atkinson took advanced,87373_0.txt
ground in his recommendations for legislation,87373_0.txt
that would stamp out mob law. He said:,87373_0.txt
""" This barbarous practice does not decrease,",87373_0.txt
but increases crime. Having stained their,87373_0.txt

When this is done he should be ineligible,87373_0.txt

killed should be authorized to recover from,87373_0.txt
"the county the full value of the life, which in",87373_0.txt
"no case should be less than$ 1,000."" The",87373_0.txt
Governor further recommended that prisoners,87373_0.txt
"attacked by mobs be unshackled, armed with",87373_0.txt
"a gun, and told to defend themselves.",87373_0.txt
"These recommendations were made, also, because",87373_0.txt
", during the past year, there have been",87373_0.txt
some particularly atrocious displays of mob,87373_0.txt
violence in Georgia. The Governor's recommendations,87373_0.txt
"created a sensation, of course, and",87373_0.txt
especially that one as to arming prisoners when,87373_0.txt
attacked by inobs. Legislators everywhere reflect,87373_0.txt
very generally the feeling and temper of,87373_0.txt
"their constituents, and the Georgia legislator",87373_0.txt
proceeds very cautiously in condemning mob,87373_0.txt
law as was shown recently in the resolution,87373_0.txt
adopted concerning the shooting of Postmaster,87373_0.txt
Loftin at Hogansville. The President was condemned,87373_0.txt

that they might escape in some way,87377_1.txt
that one man has watched all night,87377_1.txt
"within the jail, and last night Kelly",87377_1.txt
was on watch. There was a meeting,87377_1.txt
of the lodge of Woodmen in a building,87377_1.txt
"near the jail, and, as Kelly was",87377_1.txt
"a member, he expected to meet some",87377_1.txt
of the members of the lodge after the,87377_1.txt
"meeting had adjourned, to consult with",87377_1.txt
them about some matter under consideration,87377_1.txt
by the lodge. To while away,87377_1.txt
the time during the night hours he,87377_1.txt
was playing solitaire at a little table,87377_1.txt
in front of the cells in which the murderers,87377_1.txt
were confined. At about 2 o'clock,87377_1.txt
in the morning,87377_1.txt
THERE WAS A RAP,87377_1.txt
"at the outer door of the jail, and",87377_1.txt
Kelly arose quickly and turned,87377_1.txt
the,87377_1.txt
"key in the lock, thinking that the",87377_1.txt
persons he expected to meet had arrived,87377_1.txt
. No sooner had he opened the,87377_1.txt
door than the members of the mob,87377_1.txt
crowded into the small jail corridor.,87377_1.txt
"All of them were masked, and the",87377_1.txt
"leaders carried ropes, purchased new",87377_1.txt
for the occasion. Kelly at once realized,87377_1.txt
that the mob had come after his,87377_1.txt
prisoners. The lynchers were quiet,87377_1.txt
but determined. The leader presented,87377_1.txt
a revolver at the head of the deputy,87377_1.txt
sheriff and told him they wanted his,87377_1.txt
"prisoners, and demanded that he open",87377_1.txt
the cells in which they were confined.,87377_1.txt
"Kelly demurred, but the leader of the",87377_1.txt
mob told him that they desired to,87377_1.txt
"gain access to the cells, and, while",87377_1.txt
"they did not want to harm him, it was",87377_1.txt
"useless for him to resist, as the were",87377_1.txt
in force. Kelly saw that resistance,87377_1.txt
was useless and unlocked the cells.,87377_1.txt
Two of the prisoners were confined in,87377_1.txt
"one cell, and the other in a separate",87377_1.txt
cell. They had been aroused from,87377_1.txt
"sleep by the entrance of the men, and",87377_1.txt
sat up half awake and trembling with,87377_1.txt
terror. Holy Track and Ireland were,87377_1.txt
"dragged from their beds, ropes were",87377_1.txt
fastened about their necks and they,87377_1.txt
"were dragged out of the jail building,",87377_1.txt
after being told to prepare for death.,87377_1.txt
The mob had more consideration,87377_1.txt
"Coudot, since the other two had con for",87377_1.txt
"fessed their crime, but Coudot had",87377_1.txt
"not, and the mob desired to learn",87377_1.txt
from him whether the two others were,87377_1.txt
guilty who are under arrest for the,87377_1.txt
crime. The self- confessed murderers,87377_1.txt
were dragged across the space intervening,87377_1.txt
between the jail and the wind,87377_1.txt
"less, upon which they were hanged",87377_1.txt
"without ceremony, reaching that spot",87377_1.txt
more dead than alive. Coudot was,87377_1.txt
to walk. He made a slight re,87377_1.txt
"allowed sistance, but it was futile. There are",87377_1.txt
"no trees in the vicinity of the scaffold,",87377_1.txt
and the mob was first at a loss for a,87377_1.txt
scaffold. The men were hurried to an,87377_1.txt
"adjacent well, and an attempt made",87377_1.txt
"to hang them from the curbing, but",87377_1.txt
it proved impossible. They were then,87377_1.txt
"dragged to a log shack near by, and",87377_1.txt
an attempt was made to hang them,87377_1.txt
"from the ends of the projecting logs,",87377_1.txt
but this effort also proved unavailing.,87377_1.txt
"A huge beef windlass, which had been",87377_1.txt
erected to suspend the carcasses of,87377_1.txt
"beeves, then offered the",87377_1.txt
slaughtered,87377_1.txt
"means sought for, and the men were",87377_1.txt
"dragged to this, and",87377_1.txt
STRUNG UP ON A CROSS BEAM.,87377_1.txt
Coudet was the first man to be,87377_1.txt
reported that he was,87377_1.txt
hanged. It is,87377_1.txt
asked before he was hanged whether,87377_1.txt
Black Hawk and Defender had also,87377_1.txt
been concerned in the murder for,87377_1.txt
which he was about to be,87377_1.txt
and answered that,87377_1.txt
"hanged,",87377_1.txt
had been. The rope,87377_1.txt
they,87377_1.txt
fastened about his,87377_1.txt
which had been,87377_1.txt
neck was then thrown over the cross,87377_1.txt
"beam, and he was raised off the ground",87377_1.txt
and suspended in air. Holy Track and,87377_1.txt
Ireland were so nearly unconscious,87377_1.txt
from the effects of the dragging that,87377_1.txt
they did not realize what was about,87377_1.txt
to happen when the ropes about their,87377_1.txt
necks were tossed over the same beam.,87377_1.txt
They were unable to stand and were,87377_1.txt
slowly raised from the ground on which,87377_1.txt
they lay until their bodies swung into,87377_1.txt
the air and dangled from the windlass,87377_1.txt
"with that of Coudot, and the three",87377_1.txt
bodies swayed to and fro in the bright,87377_1.txt
"moonlight, a ghastly spectacle. The",87377_1.txt
"mob then dispersed, mounted their",87377_1.txt
horses and rode away.,87377_1.txt
The residents of Williamsport had,87377_1.txt
been aroused by this time to the fact,87377_1.txt
that something unusual was in progress,87377_1.txt
", and made their appearance from",87377_1.txt
the scattered houses in the little ham,87377_1.txt
let and gazed with alarm at the spectacle,87377_1.txt
. The night was a bright moonlight,87377_1.txt
"one, and the actions of the mob",87377_1.txt
were plainly discernible from a considerable,87377_1.txt
distance. A few women gazed,87377_1.txt
", awe struck at the hanging of the",87377_1.txt
"murderers, from the shadow of their",87377_1.txt
houses. There was no attempt,87377_1.txt
to interfere,87377_1.txt
"with the mob, and there was",87377_1.txt
no noise of disturbance on the part,87377_1.txt
of the mob. They worked quietly,87377_1.txt
and with determination. They were in,87377_1.txt
sufficient force to have overcome any,87377_1.txt
resistance that might have been offered,87377_1.txt
", and, as there is no such thing",87377_1.txt
as a militia company or other like body,87377_1.txt
"in the vicinity, and only a few residents",87377_1.txt
"of the town, there was no one",87377_1.txt
to offer any opposition to the lynching.,87377_1.txt
HOW TWO ESCAPED.,87377_1.txt
There were two other men alleged to,87377_1.txt
have been implicated in the murders,87377_1.txt
"for which the three were lynched, and",87377_1.txt
they were saved from the same fate,87377_1.txt
by the fact that they are confined in,87377_1.txt
"the Burleigh county jail at Bismarck,",87377_1.txt
forty miles The mob would,87377_1.txt
away.,87377_1.txt
"like to have secured them also, and, if",87377_1.txt
"they had been within reach, there is",87377_1.txt
no doubt that they would have shared,87377_1.txt
the fate of their comrades. But when,87377_1.txt
Coud,87377_1.txt
Coudot was tried and sentenced to,87377_1.txt
"death, the other two men were ordered",87377_1.txt
confined in the jail at Bismarck for,87377_1.txt
"the reason that the Emmons county,",87377_1.txt
of the men.,87377_1.txt
jail had not facilities to confine all five,87377_1.txt
It is said that the lynching was precipitated,87377_1.txt
by a recent decision of the,87377_1.txt
supreme court of the state granting a,87377_1.txt
"new trial to the Indian Coudot, the",87377_1.txt
only one of the five men who had been,87377_1.txt
tried and found guilty of the crime.,87377_1.txt
Lynching has been feared ever since,87377_1.txt
"the men were first apprehended, but",87377_1.txt
the residents of the county stated that,87377_1.txt
they desired to see the men have a fair,87377_1.txt
trial. Coudot was the first man to be,87377_1.txt
"tried, and he was convicted and sentenced",87377_1.txt
to be hanged on Oct. 29 last. His,87377_1.txt
case was appealed to the supreme court,87377_1.txt
on the ground that he had been convicted,87377_1.txt
upon the testimony of an accomplice,87377_1.txt
", Paul Holy Track, and that",87377_1.txt
that testimony had not been corroborated,87377_1.txt
. Upon this appeal the supreme,87377_1.txt
court decided to grant Coudot a new,87377_1.txt
"trial, holding that there had been no",87377_1.txt
corroboration of the testimony of the,87377_1.txt
"accomplice, and that the evidence in",87377_1.txt
the case did not warrant a conviction.,87377_1.txt
Unless the prosecution had additional,87377_1.txt
"testimony to produce, this decision",87377_1.txt
would have resulted in the discharge,87377_1.txt
of the men. This prospect raised a,87377_1.txt
wave of indignation throughout the,87377_1.txt
"county, which has resulted in",87377_1.txt
lynching early this morning. the,87377_1.txt
THE CRIME,87377_1.txt
for which the three men were hanged,87377_1.txt
was one of the most horrible in the,87377_1.txt
annals of brutality and atrocity. On,87377_1.txt
Feb. 17 last a passer entering the house,87377_1.txt
"of Rev. Thomas Spicer, a Methodist",87377_1.txt
"circuit rider, discovered the dead body",87377_1.txt
"of his mother- in- law, Mrs. Ellen Wal",87377_1.txt
"dron, lying upon the floor of the parlor",87377_1.txt
", horribly mutilated. Passing to",87377_1.txt
another room he found the body of,87377_1.txt
"Mrs. William Rouse, a daughter of",87377_1.txt
"Spicer, also dead, with her twin baby",87377_1.txt
"boys brutally murdered, their brains",87377_1.txt
"having been dashed out, and Mrs.",87377_1.txt
Rouse having been killed with a club.,87377_1.txt
At the barn was found the body of,87377_1.txt
"Mrs. Spicer, likewise horribly",87377_1.txt
"lated, she having been shot, and after muti",87377_1.txt
"wards stabbed with a pitchfork, her",87377_1.txt
"breast being filled with wounds, and",87377_1.txt
her head crushed with an ax. Inside,87377_1.txt
the barn was the body of Thomas,87377_1.txt
"Spicer, who had been shot through",87377_1.txt
"the back with a shotgun, and his",87377_1.txt
throat cut from ear to ear. The spectacle,87377_1.txt
"was sickening, and the crime",87377_1.txt
created most intense excitement and,87377_1.txt
victims were,87377_1.txt
indignation The six,87377_1.txt
.,87377_1.txt
For,87377_1.txt
buried in graves side by side.,87377_1.txt
some time there was no clue to the,87377_1.txt
"murderers, but the officers finally arrested",87377_1.txt
an Indian half- breed named,87377_1.txt
Coudot and a negro half- breed named,87377_1.txt
"Black Hawk, upon suspicion of having",87377_1.txt
been concerned in the erime. Not long,87377_1.txt
afterwards rings and jewelry that had,87377_1.txt
disappeared from the Spicer house,87377_1.txt
at the time of the murder were found,87377_1.txt
in the possession of a young full- blooded,87377_1.txt
"Indian, Paul Holy Track, and he,",87377_1.txt
"with a companion, Phiip Ireland, was",87377_1.txt
arrested. They having been confined,87377_1.txt
"in jail for several days, the two boys",87377_1.txt
made a complete confession of the,87377_1.txt
"crime, implicating Black Hawk, Coudot",87377_1.txt
and an Indian named George Defender.,87377_1.txt
All of the men were arrested and,87377_1.txt
"lodged in jail. Prior to the trial, Cou",87377_1.txt
dot made an attempt at suicide by,87377_1.txt
stabbing himself with a knife. Coudot,87377_1.txt
also made a statement in which he,87377_1.txt
accused Black Hawk of the crime. The,87377_1.txt
trials of the men were begun at Will,87377_1.txt
iamsport last July. The young In,87377_1.txt
dians went on the stand and recited,87377_1.txt
"the story of the murders, a narrative",87377_1.txt
so horrible as to sicken every hearer.,87377_1.txt
The testimony showed that the idea,87377_1.txt
of killing some family in the vicinity,87377_1.txt
of Winona for their money was conceived,87377_1.txt
"by the two men, Black Hawk",87377_1.txt
"and Coudot. On Feb. 11, the Indian,",87377_1.txt
"Holy Track, who had known Black",87377_1.txt
"Hawk for thirteen years, met Black",87377_1.txt
Hawk on the bank of the river in the,87377_1.txt
timber between Winona and the Standing,87377_1.txt
Rock agency. Holy Track was on,87377_1.txt
his way to Winona to buy whisky.,87377_1.txt
"The two had a rambling conversation,",87377_1.txt
and Black Hawk called attention to,87377_1.txt
the number of cattle in the vicinity,87377_1.txt
"that had no brands, and suggested",87377_1.txt
that they kill some of them and sell,87377_1.txt
the beef. From this the conversation,87377_1.txt
was skillfully led about by Black Hawk,87377_1.txt
"to the subject of murder, and he asked",87377_1.txt
young Holy Track what he thought,87377_1.txt
of the idea of killing some neighboring,87377_1.txt
family for their money. The young,87377_1.txt
"Indian acquiesced in the plan, and",87377_1.txt
Black Hawk gave him a bottle of whisky,87377_1.txt
to,87377_1.txt
SEAL THE COMPACT.,87377_1.txt
On the following Saturday Holy,87377_1.txt
"Track met Coudot at the agency, and",87377_1.txt
"the two went down under a hill near,",87377_1.txt
"to talk over some matters, at the re",87377_1.txt
When they arrived,87377_1.txt
quest of Coudot.,87377_1.txt
at a secluded place Coudot asked the,87377_1.txt
other man if he had ever had any conversation,87377_1.txt
"with Black Hawk, and Holy",87377_1.txt
Track said he had. Then Coudot asked,87377_1.txt
"him what he thought of the plan, and",87377_1.txt
Holy Track said it was all right and,87377_1.txt
that he was willing. The Indian De,87377_1.txt
fender made his appearance shortly after,87377_1.txt
"the two had come to an agreement,",87377_1.txt
and was informed by Coudot that Holy,87377_1.txt
Track was willing to enter into the,87377_1.txt
"scheme of murder, showing that De",87377_1.txt
fender was already cognizant of what,87377_1.txt
had been proposed by Black Hawk.,87377_1.txt
"After some discussion, the murderers",87377_1.txt
"settled upon the Spicer family, because",87377_1.txt
there was known to be only one old,87377_1.txt
"man there, and the erime could be accomplished",87377_1.txt
without danger to the murderers,87377_1.txt
.,87377_1.txt
A few days later Coudot again saw,87377_1.txt
"the Indian Holy Track and said that,",87377_1.txt
if they did the deed at the time,87377_1.txt
"upon between them and Black agreed Hawk,",87377_1.txt
and the latter was one of the participants,87377_1.txt
", he would get all the money, as",87377_1.txt
he had cheated them in sundry criminal,87377_1.txt
"negotiations before. Accordingly,",87377_1.txt
he proposed that they do the killing,87377_1.txt
"on the following day, before the time",87377_1.txt
that Black Hawk had suggested it be,87377_1.txt
"done, and steal a march on him. Holy",87377_1.txt
Track agreed to this. He had already,87377_1.txt
"told young Philip Ireland of the plan,",87377_1.txt
"and the boy had agreed to it, under the",87377_1.txt
influence of the older Indians. On the,87377_1.txt
"following day, Feb. 17, Holy Track and",87377_1.txt
"Ireland rode to the Spicer place, according",87377_1.txt
"to a previously arranged plan,",87377_1.txt
and waited there for the arrival of,87377_1.txt
"Coudot and Defender, when the",87377_1.txt
der was to be done. mur,87377_1.txt
They arrived shortly after noon. The,87377_1.txt
two boys went into the house and waited,87377_1.txt
for the arrival of the other men.,87377_1.txt
"When they came, which was after some",87377_1.txt
"little time, Defender asked Holy Track",87377_1.txt
in Indian what number of persons were,87377_1.txt
"at the house, and, upon being told, said",87377_1.txt
he would take the horses they had,87377_1.txt
"ridden down into the timber, and then",87377_1.txt
come back and help do the killing. All,87377_1.txt
"of the men were drunk, and the pro",87377_1.txt
posed murder was thus discussed in,87377_1.txt
Indian in the presence of Mrs. Spicer.,87377_1.txt
After the two men had gone out she,87377_1.txt
"asked Holy Track what they had said,",87377_1.txt
and he told her they were hungry and,87377_1.txt
"had not had their dinner, to which",87377_1.txt
she responded that if she had known,87377_1.txt

dinner. She noticed their evident intoxication,87377_1.txt

HIS CONFESSION:,87377_1.txt
""" Spicer went out of the house to the stable",87377_1.txt
and Ireland and I went with him. We were,87377_1.txt
there quite a long time before Coudot and,87377_1.txt
Defender came back. The old man( Spicer),87377_1.txt
"was hauling farm refuse. Defender, Coudot",87377_1.txt
"and myself were inside, and when Spicer",87377_1.txt
would go out we would go behind the door,87377_1.txt
"and take a drink. Finally, when he went out",87377_1.txt
"with a load, Coudot told me to shoot, and I",87377_1.txt
said I couldn't do it. Then he told. Defender,87377_1.txt
"to shoot, and he said he couldn't do it. We",87377_1.txt
"wanted Coudot to shoot, and he wouldn't do",87377_1.txt
"it. Then I told them to give me the gun, that",87377_1.txt
"I would do it, and the next time started",87377_1.txt
out with a load I shot him. Defender he picked,87377_1.txt
up the pitchfork and jabbed him. Philip came,87377_1.txt
"in the stable then, and Defender told him to",87377_1.txt
"go and get the shovel and hit him, and he",87377_1.txt
"did. I told Philip to load up the gun again,",87377_1.txt
and I went in and took another drink. After,87377_1.txt
we had all gone inside of the stable again,87377_1.txt
Defender wanted to go up and bring Mrs.,87377_1.txt
"Spicer down, and he would not do it so I",87377_1.txt
went. I went up to the house and told her,87377_1.txt
"that her man wanted her, and she wanted to",87377_1.txt
know if the Indians had come to buy her,87377_1.txt
horse and I told her yes. When we got close,87377_1.txt
to the stable I ran in and told Defender to,87377_1.txt
"shoot, and he said he couldn't so I took the",87377_1.txt
gun and just as she got inside the door I,87377_1.txt
shot her. Philip went and stabbed her with,87377_1.txt
"the fork, and Defender hit her with an ax,",87377_1.txt
and Coudot hit her with a shovel. We came,87377_1.txt
out of the stable and drank two bottles of,87377_1.txt
whisky and covered up the blood. Coudot,87377_1.txt

"going in I heard the women crying, and I",87377_1.txt
"threw away a cordwood stick I had, and",87377_1.txt
picked up a branding iron. Coudot went in,87377_1.txt
"first, and when I got in he was lying on the",87377_1.txt
"floor, near the cellar, and had dropped the",87377_1.txt

NEWS OF THE LYNCHING,87377_1.txt

Shier late this afternoon from the messenger,87377_1.txt
who rode up from Williamsport.,87377_1.txt
He was shocked to learn that the men,87377_1.txt
"had met with mob violence, but",87377_1.txt
there have been threats of lynching as,87377_1.txt
"ever since the men were arrested, and",87377_1.txt
he has several times had to exercise,87377_1.txt
considerable strategy to remove the,87377_1.txt
murderers from one place to another,87377_1.txt
without letting them fall into the,87377_1.txt
hands of the mob he was not altogeth-,87377_1.txt
",",87377_1.txt
er unprepared for such news. Had the,87377_1.txt
sheriff been there at the time of the,87377_1.txt
"affair, it is doubtful if it would have",87377_1.txt
"passed off as quietly as it did, as he is",87377_1.txt
a courageous officer and would not,87377_1.txt
have surrendered the men without a,87377_1.txt
struggle. He left at once upon receipt,87377_1.txt
of the news for Williamsport to,87377_1.txt
take action in the matter. Gov. Briggs,87377_1.txt
"is out of the state, and a message was",87377_1.txt
sent to him this afternoon apprising,87377_1.txt
him of the lynching. What action will,87377_1.txt
be taken by the authorities remains to,87377_1.txt
be seen. It is doubtful if any of the,87377_1.txt
men who took part in the affair can be,87377_1.txt
identified. The sentiment in Emmons,87377_1.txt
"county is all against the men, and,",87377_1.txt
while there will be regret at the fact,87377_1.txt
that the mob took the matter into their,87377_1.txt
"own hands, few, if any, will admit that",87377_1.txt
the fate of the men was undeserved.,87377_1.txt
Memory of their awful crime is still,87377_1.txt
"fresh, and there is no doubt in the",87377_1.txt
minds of the residents of that county,87377_1.txt
that the men were guilty.,87377_1.txt
The Standing Rock Indian reservation,87377_1.txt
is only about fifty miles from the,87377_1.txt
scene of the lynching. The better class,87377_1.txt
of the Indians professed no sympathy,87377_1.txt
"for the murderers, and at the time of",87377_1.txt
the confession of the crime applied to,87377_1.txt
the Indian authorities to take the In,87377_1.txt
"dians out and shoot them, after their",87377_1.txt
"fashion of punishing murderers, but",87377_1.txt
there is no doubt that the victims had,87377_1.txt
"friends on the reservation, and what",87377_1.txt
complications may arise cannot be told.,87377_1.txt
The Indians may seek revenge for the,87377_1.txt

have all along stated that they were,87377_1.txt
"satisfied to have them hanged legally,",87377_1.txt

prosecutor in the case. The alleged lynching,87418_0.txt
occurred on night the deceased was re,87418_0.txt
leased from Jall.,87418_0.txt
The defense announced that they would ask,87418_0.txt
the court to dismiss the case on the ground,87418_0.txt
that the act under which action was brought,87418_0.txt
only contemplated an action for damages,87418_0.txt
against a county in cases where the party,87418_0.txt
lynched has been taken from the custody of,87418_0.txt
public offlcers by the lynchers.,87418_0.txt
In delivering the opinion Judge Aldrich said,87418_0.txt
that the question in his mind was whether,87418_0.txt
the act and constitutional provision was to,87418_0.txt
stop lynching in general more than particu,87418_0.txt
Inrly to stop the connivance of officers of the,87418_0.txt
law in permitting lynching or not preventing,87418_0.txt
It. His construction was that both,87418_0.txt
"of the act should be taken together, and sections they",87418_0.txt
referred only to the lynching of prisoners or,87418_0.txt
persons in the hands of the officers of the,87418_0.txt
law. As the testimony did not bear out facts.,87418_0.txt
sufficient to base a verdiet for the plaintiff in,87418_0.txt
"the face of the above ruling of the court, the",87418_0.txt
jury was directed to find for the defendant.,87418_0.txt
What is the natural inference from,87418_0.txt
case? Simply that anti- lynching statutes this,87418_0.txt
can be as easily evaded as any other crim-,87418_0.txt
The dependence of society,87418_0.txt

"Herman Kenny, 18 years old, was shot by",87427_0.txt
a negro named Garfield King. The shot,87427_0.txt
penetrated the abdomen and lodged some,87427_0.txt
where near the spine. Physicians were unable,87427_0.txt
to locate it.,87427_0.txt
The story of the shooting as told by those,87427_0.txt
"who saw it: Young Kenny, it is said, was in",87427_0.txt
"the store, when a negro came in and brushed",87427_0.txt
against him in an insolent manner. The two,87427_0.txt
"had some words, but Kenny did nothing, as",87427_0.txt
there were several negroes there and they are,87427_0.txt
known as a rather dangerous gang. A,87427_0.txt
moment later another negro who was outside,87427_0.txt
the door called Kenny a vile name and told,87427_0.txt
him to come outside and he would show him,87427_0.txt
what they would do for him. He went to the,87427_0.txt
"door, and as soon as he was on the steps King",87427_0.txt
"shot him. The negro's story, as told to the",87427_0.txt
"reporter, is that when Kenny came outside he",87427_0.txt
struck him twice and he was compelled to,87427_0.txt
shoot him in self- defence.,87427_0.txt
Sheriff Dashield arrested King and took him,87427_0.txt
to jail.,87427_0.txt
THE LYNCHED.,87427_0.txt
About 1 a. m. on Thursday a demand was,87427_0.txt
made upon the Sheriff for King by a large,87427_0.txt
"number of men, but he refused to give him",87427_0.txt
"up. They soon found a telegraph pole, and",87427_0.txt
"using that as a ram, the doors quickly gave",87427_0.txt
"way. King was taken to a tree and hung up,",87427_0.txt
but the rope broke and he fell to the ground.,87427_0.txt
Again he was hung up and riddled with bullets,87427_0.txt
. The lynchers were not disguised. They,87427_0.txt
were from the neighborhood of the,87427_0.txt
and were friends of the young man. shooting,87427_0.txt
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.,87429_0.txt
Lynch Law and Preventive.,87429_0.txt
To the Editor of The Post.,87429_0.txt
"Brenham, Texas, July 15, 1897.- After",87429_0.txt
reading the many and varied remedies sug-,87429_0.txt
ested in The Post regarding lynchings,87429_0.txt
in Texas I desire to state my own views,87429_0.txt
and conclusions as to the best course to,87429_0.txt
Junsue in restraining and mitigating the,87429_0.txt
evil.,87429_0.txt
"First, the incentive to lynch springs from",87429_0.txt
an inborn impulse to resent and avenge a,87429_0.txt
heinous crime. The delays of the law has,87429_0.txt
nothing to do in prompting the action of,87429_0.txt
the mob. This is shown in the action of,87429_0.txt
a mob in Maryland a few days since who,87429_0.txt
"met a brute at the court house door, who",87429_0.txt
had just been tried and sentenced,87429_0.txt
to ath,87429_0.txt
and hanged him to a telegraph pole.,87429_0.txt
Under that impulse they would snatch,87429_0.txt
criminal from the gallows and hang,87429_0.txt
him. Giving the court authority to convene,87429_0.txt
the court and grand jury at once,87429_0.txt
"to try the criminal, will avail nothing unless",87429_0.txt
"the court can beat the mob, which it",87429_0.txt
"can't do, for while the court is getting together",87429_0.txt
", the mob will have done its work.",87429_0.txt
The spirit that moves the mob is that they,87429_0.txt
"themselves must be the executioners, because",87429_0.txt
they are moved by a personal feel-,87429_0.txt
of revenge. That the action of another,87429_0.txt
will not appease.,87429_0.txt
"Hence, the late law will prove as futile",87429_0.txt
as the former. providing for a speedy,87429_0.txt
trial will not in Its the least satisfy or af-,87429_0.txt
In anyway secure conviction the of the,87429_0.txt
fect the mob. Nor will a change of venue,87429_0.txt
In anyway secure the conviction of the,87429_0.txt
lynchers.,87429_0.txt
The other day I asked a man if he favored,87429_0.txt
lynch law and with great omphasia,87429_0.txt
",",87429_0.txt
he said civilized people would permit it,87429_0.txt
"no,",87429_0.txt
and that it could not be sanctioned by rny,87429_0.txt
individual. I said suppose your own,87429_0.txt
daughter were the victim of an assault little by,87429_0.txt
"te mobbed"" p. d. q."" In this expression",87429_0.txt
human nature crops out pretty strong.,87429_0.txt
As long as it is somebody else we feel,87429_0.txt
Inclined to let the law take its course.,87429_0.txt
But when the horrid crime,87429_0.txt
is perpetrated,87429_0.txt
in our own household with all our soul we,87429_0.txt
call,87429_0.txt
upon our neighbors,87429_0.txt
to help lynch the,87429_0.txt
"brute. This is the feeling of the individual,",87429_0.txt
and what is a mob but a number of in-,87429_0.txt
dividuals of like feeling and impulses?,87429_0.txt
"Now, when one of these heinous crimes",87429_0.txt
has been committed and the perpetrator,87429_0.txt
been lynched and the lynchers brought to,87429_0.txt
"trial, canvass public sentiment",87429_0.txt
to,87429_0.txt
"whether they should be punished, and the",87429_0.txt
"average juryman will say,"" If I were on",87429_0.txt
the jury in such a case I would not hang,87429_0.txt
"a good man for lynching such a brute.""",87429_0.txt
Verdicts,87429_0.txt
are generally the echo of pub-,87429_0.txt
1io sentiment. The jurors are drawn from,87429_0.txt
the public and who,87429_0.txt
", are Individually possessed",87429_0.txt
of,87429_0.txt
that sentiment. No jury with,87429_0.txt
change the venue and try in a county ot,87429_0.txt
excited by the crime. Human nature is,87429_0.txt
"the same the world over, and on proof of",87429_0.txt
the facts the result of the trial will be,87429_0.txt
the same.,87429_0.txt
It is not my purpose to justify lynchings.,87429_0.txt
"nor to condemn them, but to simply state",87429_0.txt
stubborn facts and conditions that always,87429_0.txt
have and always will prove,87429_0.txt
barriers to convictions in such insumountable cases.,87429_0.txt
"Some offenses are, by common consent,",87429_0.txt
beyond the pale of the law. If the affections,87429_0.txt
of a man's wife are alienated by an,87429_0.txt
"other and he is slain by the husband, who",87429_0.txt
ever heard of the slayers conviction? And,87429_0.txt
"yet, in law, it is as much murder as in",87429_0.txt
the case of lynching. But a short time,87429_0.txt
"since, a judge in Louisiana announced from",87429_0.txt
the bench in trying such a case that cus-,87429_0.txt
tom and tradition in the South had given,87429_0.txt
the right to slay in such cases the force,87429_0.txt
of rights that is,87429_0.txt
higher than the constitution and laws.,87429_0.txt
"Now, the same public sentiment that",87429_0.txt
protects the husband is a powerful factor,87429_0.txt
in case of assaults upon women.,87429_0.txt
"Weil, to use a common but expressive",87429_0.txt
"phrase, what are we going to do about it",87429_0.txt
"It can not be prevented by legislation, and?",87429_0.txt
"all we can hope to do is to restrain, con-",87429_0.txt
"trol or mitigate the evil, in my opinion,",87429_0.txt
by legislation on the following lines: Pass,87429_0.txt
a law clearly defining certain heinous offenses,87429_0.txt
to be affected by the law. When,87429_0.txt
one of the defined crimes has been committed,87429_0.txt
and the perpetrator lynched arrest,87429_0.txt
"and try the lynchers as in other offenses,",87429_0.txt
except that the only issue tried shall be:,87429_0.txt

fense charged against him? And on satisfactory,87429_0.txt
proof that he was that the lyuchers,87429_0.txt
or,87429_0.txt
"Now, when a mob assembles, there are",87429_0.txt
always some men more level- headed and,87429_0.txt
cautious than others. The mob does not,87429_0.txt
"desire to punish an innocent man, which",87429_0.txt
is the one great danger in lynch law. Now.,87429_0.txt
if there is a safe course open to the mob,87429_0.txt
"the more thoughtful of them will say,",87429_0.txt
""" Boys, there is a way in which we can",87429_0.txt
hang the man and he protected ourselves,87429_0.txt

effect that the courts of that state could,87613_1.txt
not be relied upon to enforce the law,87613_1.txt
and punish criminals. A malicious and,87613_1.txt
deliberate second thought formulated,87613_1.txt
the conclusion that this was dangerous,87613_1.txt
ground upon which to seek to justify,87613_1.txt
"mob violence in Texas, and the daily",87613_1.txt
"papers, especially the Fort Worth Gazette",87613_1.txt
"and the people of Wichita Falls,",87613_1.txt
in their wisrom and malice undertook,87613_1.txt
to shift the odium of these outrages,87613_1.txt
"and the responsibility for these crimes,",87613_1.txt
"on another, and almost defenseless",87613_1.txt

"blooded affrontery, characteristic of",87613_1.txt
"the lordly outlaw, the Gazette and the",87613_1.txt
people of Wichita Falls insisted that,87613_1.txt
the mob came out of that work whiter,87613_1.txt
"than snow, and that the people of the",87613_1.txt

"the 2nd day of March, 1836, there was",87613_1.txt
"a call session of the Wichita Falls mob,",87613_1.txt

Age- Herald's readers is my experience,89389_0.txt

Some three years ago I fancied that,89389_0.txt
I had made a discovery all my own,89389_0.txt
"in these middle western states, viz:",89389_0.txt
"that, outside the republican machine",89389_0.txt
and the few whom high protection,89389_0.txt

"Interest that merchants, farmers, city",89389_0.txt
"business men of all classes, indeed",89389_0.txt
everybody I would talk with on the,89389_0.txt
trains who had no peculiar stake in,89389_0.txt
"the tariff, was convinced that its rates",89389_0.txt
were unjustly high. The republican,89389_0.txt
leaders did not fall to take the hint.,89389_0.txt
In their national platform of 1908 they,89389_0.txt
put something that the country at large,89389_0.txt
construed as promising a revision,89389_0.txt
downward of the customs duties. In,89389_0.txt

of the organization republicans that,89389_0.txt
the rates of the Payne tariff are on,89389_0.txt
the whole lower than those of the,89389_0.txt
Dingley tariff would apprise the man,89389_0.txt
from Mars that the people of the United,89389_0.txt

facts suggestive of the strength of this,89389_0.txt

"cinnati to Chicago, and seemed to be a",89389_0.txt
friend of the Gentile merchant from the,89389_0.txt
latter city. This friend was joking the,89389_0.txt
other about the probable prespocts of,89389_0.txt
the republican candidate for governor,89389_0.txt
"of Ohio, but finally the other put the",89389_0.txt
laugh on the Chicago man by saying,89389_0.txt
"he was going to vote for Harmon, and",89389_0.txt
that the latter would surely be elected.,89389_0.txt
The other Cincinnati man expressed,89389_0.txt
himself to identically the same effect.,89389_0.txt
The Columbus man said he was going,89389_0.txt
"to vote for Harmon, but it was not",89389_0.txt
clear to him how the election would go.,89389_0.txt
The Springfield man would not say how,89389_0.txt
"he expected to vote, but did say that",89389_0.txt
Harmon would undoubtedly be elected.,89389_0.txt
We know that Harmon was elected by,89389_0.txt
"some 19,000 votes, notwithstanding that",89389_0.txt
Taft on the same day carried the state,89389_0.txt
"by a plurality of 69,591. Last December I",89389_0.txt

". Three were lawyers, two from",89389_0.txt
"Cincinnati, and one from somewhere in",89389_0.txt
"the Cleveland region. Akron, I belleve;",89389_0.txt
the fourth was from Springfield and well,89389_0.txt
"acquainted, as it transpired, with the",89389_0.txt
man from that town whom I had met,89389_0.txt
the year before. I asked him did he,89389_0.txt
know how his friend voted in the end.,89389_0.txt
He said he did because they talked the,89389_0.txt
matter over several times and reached,89389_0.txt
the same decision: they would stand by,89389_0.txt
their party that time and vote the,89389_0.txt
straight ticket from Harris down. He,89389_0.txt
added that both are resolved to vote for,89389_0.txt
Harmon for re- election this I,89389_0.txt
year.,89389_0.txt
asked one of the Cincinnati lawyers,89389_0.txt
whether Harmon would be renominated.,89389_0.txt
"He said he was"" afraid"" he would be.",89389_0.txt
"Why"" afraid."" I inquired. He explained",89389_0.txt
that Harmon's victory of the year before,89389_0.txt
was a great thing for his reputation and,89389_0.txt
that he( the speaker) should be sorry,89389_0.txt
to see him risk a loss of prestige by another,89389_0.txt
race when the chances would not,89389_0.txt
be so much in his favor. I suggested,89389_0.txt
"that, whatever the temporary issues may",89389_0.txt
"be, no weak or unknown man could beat",89389_0.txt
a candidate so well known and so virile,89389_0.txt
as Harmon and I asked whom could the,89389_0.txt
",",89389_0.txt
republicans pick with any confidence.,89389_0.txt
The Cincinnatian admitted that this,89389_0.txt
would be a hard search. I next asked,89389_0.txt
what element of votes would cause Har-,89389_0.txt
"mon's defeat another time, and so felt",89389_0.txt
licensed to inquire of his vote. He replied,89389_0.txt
that he had voted for Harmon before,89389_0.txt
", and would vote for him again, no",89389_0.txt
matter whom the republicans might,89389_0.txt
nominate. In this declaration the two,89389_0.txt
other lawyers joined. I came out of that,89389_0.txt
discussion with a pretty confident belief,89389_0.txt
"that Governor Harmon, if he should accept",89389_0.txt
"a second nomination, would be gov-",89389_0.txt
ernor of Ohio until the end of 1912.,89389_0.txt
Now Governor Harmon has been renominated,89389_0.txt
", and by one of the most imposing",89389_0.txt
conventions ever held in Ohio,89389_0.txt
;,89389_0.txt
and last week I traveled across that,89389_0.txt
state again. There can be no doubt that,89389_0.txt
he will be re- elected by a greatly increased,89389_0.txt
majority. A clear enough sign,89389_0.txt
of this is that the republican chiefs,89389_0.txt
haven't been able to find any man of,89389_0.txt
respectable rank in the state who would,89389_0.txt
"take the nomination, except one or two",89389_0.txt
whom they could have no hope of electing,89389_0.txt
.,89389_0.txt
The fates have given Judson Harmon a,89389_0.txt
wonderful power to bring democrats into,89389_0.txt
"accord, as well outside as within his",89389_0.txt
"state. The fates, that is to say, have",89389_0.txt
given this man some uncommon opportunities,89389_0.txt
to demonstrate his unshakable,89389_0.txt
faith in some things that all democrats,89389_0.txt
profess to believe. There is no secret,89389_0.txt
"about it, except the secret that smaller",89389_0.txt
"men, no more and no less ambitious than",89389_0.txt
"Harmon, are slow to learn- namely, that",89389_0.txt
no public man( almost none) can go very,89389_0.txt
far on the mere profession of sound principles,89389_0.txt
". Harmon, in speech and action, is",89389_0.txt
simple and straightforward; but above,89389_0.txt
all the nature of the man forbids that his,89389_0.txt
action shall not fit his words.,89389_0.txt
There is a sort of family likeness between,89389_0.txt
Harmon and Governor,89389_0.txt
"Hughes,",89389_0.txt
though the Ohian gets the ear of independent,89389_0.txt
"voters, and thoughtful men of the",89389_0.txt
opposing party in a way that seems somehow,89389_0.txt
denied to Hughes. Each of these,89389_0.txt
"is the son of a Baptist preacher, and",89389_0.txt
grew up in a small town a stranger to,89389_0.txt
"all affluence, holding the beliefs of earnest",89389_0.txt
country boys that patriotism- sanity,89389_0.txt
"and justice in the making of laws, with",89389_0.txt
honesty in their administration- is a thing,89389_0.txt
"for active practice by the people's agents,",89389_0.txt
not mere copy book texts.,89389_0.txt
The country first knew of Harmon as a,89389_0.txt
corporation lawyer. This was when Mr.,89389_0.txt
Cleveland chose him for Attorney General,89389_0.txt
. But the country soon learned not to,89389_0.txt
expect him to be soft toward corporations,89389_0.txt
and combinations of corporations.,89389_0.txt
The most conspicuous achievements of,89389_0.txt
his administration were the decisions of,89389_0.txt
the supreme court in the trans- Missouri,89389_0.txt
"Freight association, Freight Traffic association",89389_0.txt
and Addyston Pipe company,89389_0.txt
"cases, condemning two of the railroad",89389_0.txt
"pools and the other, for the first time,",89389_0.txt
breaking up a manufacturers' trust. After,89389_0.txt
"Harmon was Attorney General, and before",89389_0.txt
he was named for governor of his,89389_0.txt
"state, he held two other conspicuous stations",89389_0.txt
". He was a commissioner, appointed",89389_0.txt
"by President Roosevelt, to investigate re-",89389_0.txt
"bating by railroads, and after full and",89389_0.txt
fair probing he declared that the Santa,89389_0.txt
"Fe railroad system and Paul Morton, then",89389_0.txt
"in Mr. Roosevelt's cabinet, had broken",89389_0.txt
"the law, and should be indicted; but the",89389_0.txt
"President would not have it so, and Har-",89389_0.txt
mon resigned his commission. He was,89389_0.txt
also for some of those years receiver,89389_0.txt
"of the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton",89389_0.txt
"and Pere Marquette railroad systems,",89389_0.txt
and his methods of putting those concerns,89389_0.txt
on their feet again won the highest,89389_0.txt
praise from jurists and financiers alike.,89389_0.txt
Appealing now from Ohians to outlanders,89389_0.txt
. I will give you a few expressions,89389_0.txt
regarding Harmon's qualities for national,89389_0.txt
leadership.,89389_0.txt
Alabamians know that few public men,89389_0.txt
served the cause of free silver in 1906,89389_0.txt
"so effectively as did Joseph F. Johnston,",89389_0.txt
now your junfor senator. He won his,89389_0.txt
nomination for governor by forcing the,89389_0.txt
free- coinage issue at a time when politicians,89389_0.txt
in other states were nosing in every,89389_0.txt
direction for the breezes of public opin-,89389_0.txt
fon. Senator Johnston has very recently,89389_0.txt
"said to me:"" Harmon would be a capital",89389_0.txt
nominee for President. Surely none could,89389_0.txt
"stronger.""",89389_0.txt
view from the opposite,89389_0.txt
be,89389_0.txt
"Now, for a",89389_0.txt
angle. Within 10 days I have talked with,89389_0.txt
a chief officer of a great railroad company,89389_0.txt
", who, beginning with 1898, has been",89389_0.txt
"voting the republican presidential ticket,",89389_0.txt
and who presided over a republican state,89389_0.txt
"convention two years ago. He said:"" I",89389_0.txt
should vote for Harmon against Taft,89389_0.txt
or Roosevelt or any other man the republicans,89389_0.txt
"might name."" Within this same",89389_0.txt
short period I have also had a chance,89389_0.txt
to exchange opinions with one of the most,89389_0.txt
consecrated among Bryan's friends of the,89389_0.txt
"inmost circle. He, too, spoke of the paramount",89389_0.txt
eligibility of Harmon. More than,89389_0.txt
"this, he said that if the sniping of the",89389_0.txt
Commoner newspaper at Harmon does,89389_0.txt
not stop. Mr. Bryan will hear something,89389_0.txt
not entirely pleasant from his most loyal,89389_0.txt
supporters. Of the other school again is,89389_0.txt
a friend of mine formerly of much influence,89389_0.txt
in the democratic organization in,89389_0.txt
Tennessee. I have seen him also quite,89389_0.txt
recently Sick of the democratic futili-,89389_0.txt
ties of. 1908. quite as sick probably of,89389_0.txt
the Patterson- Carmack feud in his own,89389_0.txt
"state, he said to me he feared he should",89389_0.txt
be driven into the republican party. The,89389_0.txt
"one thing, he added, that could restore his",89389_0.txt
hope of democratic success and nerve his,89389_0.txt
"arm for the campaign again, would be the",89389_0.txt
nomination of Harmon for President.,89389_0.txt
"Something, of course, must be said",89389_0.txt
of Harmon's performances as governor,89389_0.txt
- said with a consciousness that,89389_0.txt
newspaper space needs to be grudged.,89389_0.txt
"Ohio has a comparative small debt,",89389_0.txt
and therefore supports a great many,89389_0.txt
"institutions, charitable, educational, reformatory",89389_0.txt
and semi- industrial.,89389_0.txt
Even,89389_0.txt
under the present economical regime,89389_0.txt
these institutions cost the state from,89389_0.txt
"$ 8,000,000 to$ 10,000,000 a year. The",89389_0.txt
disbursements,89389_0.txt
80 fixed that,89389_0.txt
the,89389_0.txt
are,89389_0.txt
state has for months at a time large,89389_0.txt
"accumulations of revenue. In the old,",89389_0.txt
easy times the states treasurers deposited,89389_0.txt
these accumulations in banks,89389_0.txt
"that had, in a party sense, acquired",89389_0.txt
merit. This was deemed,89389_0.txt
fair in those,89389_0.txt
times and it was amiably assumed that,89389_0.txt
the treasurer was not gaining,89389_0.txt
anything,89389_0.txt
for himself. Governor Harmon,89389_0.txt
had a theory of the law which required,89389_0.txt
that this should be investigated. The,89389_0.txt
"investigation showed that, while the",89389_0.txt
state treasury had received nothing for,89389_0.txt
"these large deposits, two of the treasurers",89389_0.txt
had received from the banks an,89389_0.txt
"aggregate, as interest, of some$ 325,-",89389_0.txt
"000. Harmon, over all manner of obstructions",89389_0.txt
"by republican managers, has",89389_0.txt
brought about the indictment of those,89389_0.txt
thrifty gentlemen.,89389_0.txt
The treasurers used to have something,89389_0.txt
of a free hand but years ago a,89389_0.txt
law was passed requiring that all state,89389_0.txt
"funds be deposited at interest, to the",89389_0.txt
"state's account, in banks, leaving still",89389_0.txt
to the treasurer almost unlimited choice,89389_0.txt
of depositaries. Naturally the banker,89389_0.txt
friends of the organization got the,89389_0.txt
large shares of the moneys and got,89389_0.txt
them at the very easy rates. When Gov-,89389_0.txt
ernor Harmon came in he caused the,89389_0.txt
treasurer( the one democrat elected,89389_0.txt
with him) to invite bids from the,89389_0.txt
"banks, naming rates of interest to be",89389_0.txt
"paid for two classes of accounts, recognized",89389_0.txt
respectfully as active and inactive,89389_0.txt
. It is not worth while to tell,89389_0.txt
of the appeals of democratic bankers,89389_0.txt
for favor in this connection. The result,89389_0.txt
speaks for itself. Under the rule,89389_0.txt
of the republican governors the state,89389_0.txt
"had received, as interest on the bat-",89389_0.txt
"ances of its check accounts, an average",89389_0.txt
of 12 per cent a year. It now receives,89389_0.txt
an average of 2 per cent. On,89389_0.txt
"the long- time deposits, comparatively",89389_0.txt
"speaking, the state now receives an",89389_0.txt
average of 3 1-10 per cent a year. The,89389_0.txt
best that the republican officers had,89389_0.txt
done,89389_0.txt
was something under 2½,89389_0.txt
per,89389_0.txt
cent.,89389_0.txt
Under a succession of republican governors,89389_0.txt
the public printer was able to,89389_0.txt
collect from the state treasury by false,89389_0.txt
"vouchers some$ 60,000. Governor Har-",89389_0.txt
mon dug up this fact and the,89389_0.txt
late,89389_0.txt
printer is now in the penitentiary.,89389_0.txt
To administer its many institutions,89389_0.txt
Ohio was a complicated and wasteful,89389_0.txt
system of commissions and the like.,89389_0.txt
Harmon has the idea of any other,89389_0.txt
good business man that if the functions,89389_0.txt
of these commissioners were centered,89389_0.txt
in one board there would be a,89389_0.txt
"large gain to the people, not merely",89389_0.txt
in economy but in efficiency as well.,89389_0.txt
"But the legislature, all the while, was",89389_0.txt
"republican; and, during two sessions,",89389_0.txt
the republican machine has in a large,89389_0.txt
measure blocked this dimunition of ot-,89389_0.txt
"ficers. So much the better, of course,",89389_0.txt
for Harmon and his second candidacy.,89389_0.txt
"This alone, no doubt, would put him",89389_0.txt
in the state house for a second time.,89389_0.txt
There is also an archaic system of as-,89389_0.txt
sessments and taxation in Ohio which,89389_0.txt
Governor Harmon has striven to cure.,89389_0.txt
"There are state boards, far too many,",89389_0.txt
commissioned to fix various privilege,89389_0.txt
taxes; and assessments and other tax,89389_0.txt
rates are governed largely by county,89389_0.txt
officers. Naturally there has been a,89389_0.txt
wide diversity as well as recurrent confusion,89389_0.txt
and litigation in the assessments,89389_0.txt
"and the rates. Governor Harmon, immediately",89389_0.txt
"upon his inauguration, urged",89389_0.txt
upon the legislature a system which,89389_0.txt
would make the law clear and prevent,89389_0.txt
these inequalities. The legislature then,89389_0.txt
dared to ignore his plan.,89389_0.txt
At the ses-,89389_0.txt
sfon recently adjourned the solons,89389_0.txt
yielded to the governor in a small,89389_0.txt
measure; they consolidated some of the,89389_0.txt
administrative boards and provisionally,89389_0.txt
"named a lower tax rate, which, on the",89389_0.txt
"fair assessments now assured, will undoubtedly",89389_0.txt
yield ample revenue.,89389_0.txt
Everybody in Ohio knows that what,89389_0.txt
Governor Harmon has accomplished in,89389_0.txt
law reform he has won from the fears,89389_0.txt
alone of the republican organization.,89389_0.txt
This is the reason that republican leaders,89389_0.txt
no longer expect to put him out of,89389_0.txt
office.,89389_0.txt
Twenty- four years ago Judson Har-,89389_0.txt
mon and Joseph B. Foraker were sitting,89389_0.txt
together in Cincinnati as superior court,89389_0.txt
Judges. A little later Harmon resigned.,89389_0.txt
His successor was William H. Taft. When,89389_0.txt
Harmon was appointed Attorney General,89389_0.txt
of the United States the judges and law-,89389_0.txt
Cincinnati gave a dinner in his,89389_0.txt
vers in Cincinnati gave a dinner in his,89389_0.txt
"cuit judge there, said something of his",89389_0.txt
democratic neighbor which some still believe,89389_0.txt
to be the happiest thing,89389_0.txt
. Here,89389_0.txt
ever,89389_0.txt
spoken by the President of this day,89389_0.txt
is a sentence from Judge Taft's speech:,89389_0.txt
""" Born and brought up in this community",89389_0.txt
", taught by his parents that",89389_0.txt
everything in this country was within the,89389_0.txt
reach of the man who would honestly,89389_0.txt
"strive after it, of vigorous mind and body,",89389_0.txt
"even temper, good digestion, the softest",89389_0.txt
"and the stoutest heart, Judson Harmon",89389_0.txt
"has moved onward and upward, with no",89389_0.txt
man to grudge him a single honor which,89389_0.txt
"he has won.""",89389_0.txt
Governor Harmon's way of dealing with,89389_0.txt
the riot situation at Newark the self.,89389_0.txt
day was thoroughly typical of himself.,89389_0.txt
He had one of the most ungrateful responsibilities,89389_0.txt
that can fall on a,89389_0.txt
ernor; but he met it as a faithful governor,89389_0.txt
will. He concluded that he had the,89389_0.txt
power to remove the city officers,89389_0.txt
had failed to protect a prisoner against who a,89389_0.txt
"mob; and, having the power, he did not",89389_0.txt
shirk the duty. There is nothing,89389_0.txt
an,89389_0.txt
American community is more sensitive,89389_0.txt
about than the independence of its local,89389_0.txt
officers. I can well remember that the,89389_0.txt
late Governor Seay suffered to the end in,89389_0.txt
some parts of Alabama for merely writing,89389_0.txt
a sharp letter to a sheriff who had let a,89389_0.txt
mob lynch a prisoner.,89389_0.txt
One more straw from the Ohio winds,89389_0.txt
and I stop. I have- I hope I shall always,89389_0.txt

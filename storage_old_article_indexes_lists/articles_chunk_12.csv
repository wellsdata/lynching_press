"Springfield, Mo., says: Traveling Audi-",86960_0.txt
tor Townsend of the Gulf road arrived in,86960_0.txt
that city at noon from the South and verifies,86960_0.txt
the report of one of the negro county,86960_0.txt
officials having been lynched by a mob of,86960_0.txt
white men. Townsend says it is a difficult,86960_0.txt
matter to get any details of the proceedings,86960_0.txt
at Marion which is under a,86960_0.txt
guard of armed men. A general state of,86960_0.txt

or messengers are allowed to go in or out,86960_0.txt

Townsend states that the victim was a,86960_0.txt
county official and one of the banished,86960_0.txt
eighteen. The mob seized him while he,86960_0.txt
was endeavoring to effect an entrance to,86960_0.txt

LET JUSTICE BE DONE.,86963_0.txt
The lynching of the man and womau,86963_0.txt
on the Sweetwater may be deplorable.,86963_0.txt
All resorts to lynch law are deplorable in,86963_0.txt
"a country governed by laws, but when the",86963_0.txt
"law shows itself powerless and inactive,",86963_0.txt
"when justice is lame and halting, when",86963_0.txt
there is failure to convict on down- right,86963_0.txt
"proofs, it is not in the nature of enterprising",86963_0.txt
western men to sit idly by and,86963_0.txt
have their cattle stolen and slaughtered,86963_0.txt
under their very noses.,86963_0.txt
It is easy for an editor sitting in the security,86963_0.txt
of his sanctum in Denver or Salt,86963_0.txt
Lake to work himself into a condition of,86963_0.txt
maudlin sentimentality over this particular,86963_0.txt
lynching but we have noticed that,86963_0.txt
these same editors never submit very,86963_0.txt
gracefully to any imposition practiced up,86963_0.txt
on themselves.,86963_0.txt
THE LEADER believes in upholding the,86963_0.txt
"right, whether it is on the side of the",86963_0.txt
corporation or the individual. While,86963_0.txt
"there is no doubt that the Stock Growers""",86963_0.txt
Association once carried things with a,86963_0.txt
"high hand in Wyoming, as a Rawlins correspondent",86963_0.txt
"suggests, this is no justification",86963_0.txt
for the private individuals now to,86963_0.txt
plunder companies that have never done,86963_0.txt
them any harm.,86963_0.txt
THE LEADER has heretofore shown,86963_0.txt
that the cattle companies contribute enormously,86963_0.txt
to the taxable wealth in all the,86963_0.txt
counties of the territory. They pay taxes,86963_0.txt
to a county government for protection and,86963_0.txt
their property should be held as sacred as,86963_0.txt
the property of any private individual.,86963_0.txt
There is no doubt that on the Sweetwater,86963_0.txt
and elsewhere there are men who make a,86963_0.txt
business of stealing cattle. It is an open,86963_0.txt
secret as to who they are in several localities,86963_0.txt
. Assassination of men who are opposed,86963_0.txt
to these rustling practices has been,86963_0.txt
attempted and very many men have been,86963_0.txt
intimidated through threats that their,86963_0.txt
lives would be taken.,86963_0.txt
Dishonestly whether practised by corporations,86963_0.txt
"or individuals, should not be",86963_0.txt
upheld or even countenanced in any,86963_0.txt
county of Wyoming territory. A calf or,86963_0.txt
yearling stolen from a corporation is no,86963_0.txt
less a crime than though it were stolen,86963_0.txt
from an individual. This fact seems to,86963_0.txt
have been lost sight of by jurors who,86963_0.txt
have failed to convict on evidence as plain,86963_0.txt
as day. Lawlessness of any sort is not,86963_0.txt
creditable to a territory which aspires to,86963_0.txt
admission into the Union as a state and,86963_0.txt
the sooner it is suppressed by the strong,86963_0.txt
arm of the law the better it will be for,86963_0.txt
all concerned.,86963_0.txt
Lynch law is rarely justifiable though,86963_0.txt
we have known cases where it was. The,86963_0.txt
trouble with it is that like justice it is,86963_0.txt
blind and gives sway to the mad passions,86963_0.txt
of men which it is always better to keep,86963_0.txt
within bounds.,86963_0.txt

nera inquest into the death of the eight,86968_0.txt
negroes lynched at Barnwell was held,86968_0.txt
Saturday night at the scene of the tragedy.,86968_0.txt
It was a terrible sight which the jurymen,86968_0.txt
looked upon. On the left side of the,86968_0.txt
road were the bodies of Ripley Johnson,86968_0.txt
"and Mitchell Adams, charged with the",86968_0.txt
murder of Heffernan. On the opposite,86968_0.txt
side were the six bodies of the negroes,86968_0.txt
charged with implication in the murder of,86968_0.txt
young Robert Martin. They were tied to,86968_0.txt
trees to the roadside( backs to the sap,86968_0.txt

all sorts of grotesque and revolting,86968_0.txt

turning to consciousness. He could,86970_0.txt
not have actually been suspended in,86970_0.txt
"mid air more than a few seconds, and",86970_0.txt
yet in that brief space of time all the,86970_0.txt
events of his past life passed through,86970_0.txt
his mind.,86970_0.txt
It is true that his life up to,86970_0.txt
that date had not been a very eventful,86970_0.txt
"one, being only 19 years of age;",86970_0.txt
but every past sensation was renewed,86970_0.txt
in all its freshness. It is also remark,86970_0.txt
able that he did not at the time experience,86970_0.txt
"any sensation of fear; while,",86970_0.txt

Sheriff meekly stood aside and let,87050_0.txt

of them.,87050_0.txt

stood his ground. He first had a,87050_0.txt
"fire hose turned on the mob, but",87050_0.txt
this only brought a rain of bricks.,87050_0.txt
He then held the mob at bay until,87050_0.txt

law officers prevented lynchings in,87050_0.txt
"fifty- eight instances, either by strategy",87050_0.txt
or by force. In four cases they,87050_0.txt
used arms. It probably is,87050_0.txt

a hundred willing hands seized the noose,87054_0.txt

the cord the knotFslipped to the back,87054_0.txt

face to the pole. Before the negro had,87054_0.txt
been drawn up the man on the pole had,87054_0.txt
slipped down. An attempt was made,87054_0.txt
to tie the rope to the post and suspend,87054_0.txt

to hold and the body slid down.,87054_0.txt

LYNCH LAW IN GEORGIA.,87373_0.txt
The Charge of Criminal Assault as an Excuse,87373_0.txt
for Lynchings and the Record.,87373_0.txt
Gov. Atkinson of Georgia has been persistent,87373_0.txt
"in his opposition to mob law, all through his",87373_0.txt
"first term, and in his second term, which he is",87373_0.txt
"now serving, he has undoubtedly done a great",87373_0.txt
deal toward curbing the excesses of the mob,87373_0.txt
spirit in his State. He deserves well of the,87373_0.txt
people of Georgia and of the whole country,87373_0.txt
for the unyielding stand he has always taken for,87373_0.txt
the orderly enforcement of the laws. Those,87373_0.txt
who are familiar with the conditions and the,87373_0.txt
temper of the people of Georgia appreciate at,87373_0.txt
its full value the service he has rendered. It,87373_0.txt
is a position not easily taken and maintained,87373_0.txt
in such an atmosphere by a young and ambitious,87373_0.txt
man. He has had to encounter fierce opposition,87373_0.txt
"from leaders and masses, but instead of",87373_0.txt
"diminishing, it has rather intensified his zeal.",87373_0.txt
In his annual message to the Legislature a,87373_0.txt
short time ago Gov. Atkinson took advanced,87373_0.txt
ground in his recommendations for legislation,87373_0.txt
that would stamp out mob law. He said:,87373_0.txt
""" This barbarous practice does not decrease,",87373_0.txt

measure of his duty in protecting his prisoner.,87373_0.txt
When this is done he should be ineligible,87373_0.txt

killed should be authorized to recover from,87373_0.txt
"the county the full value of the life, which in",87373_0.txt
"no case should be less than$ 1,000."" The",87373_0.txt
Governor further recommended that prisoners,87373_0.txt
"attacked by mobs be unshackled, armed with",87373_0.txt
"a gun, and told to defend themselves.",87373_0.txt
"These recommendations were made, also, because",87373_0.txt
", during the past year, there have been",87373_0.txt
some particularly atrocious displays of mob,87373_0.txt
violence in Georgia. The Governor's recommendations,87373_0.txt
"created a sensation, of course, and",87373_0.txt
especially that one as to arming prisoners when,87373_0.txt
attacked by inobs. Legislators everywhere reflect,87373_0.txt
very generally the feeling and temper of,87373_0.txt
"their constituents, and the Georgia legislator",87373_0.txt
proceeds very cautiously in condemning mob,87373_0.txt
law as was shown recently in the resolution,87373_0.txt
adopted concerning the shooting of Postmaster,87373_0.txt
Loftin at Hogansville. The President was condemned,87373_0.txt

of the tragedy.,87376_0.txt
At 2 o'clock this afternoon the body,87376_0.txt
was still hanging to the tree.,87376_0.txt
The grand jury was in session when,87376_0.txt
the news of the hanging reached the,87376_0.txt
city.,87376_0.txt
The prisoner would have been mob,87376_0.txt
bed had ne been kept in the city jail,87376_0.txt
last night. There were knots of people,87376_0.txt
on the streets until midnight last,87376_0.txt
night discussing the tragedy.,87376_0.txt
Some of these had to be taken,87376_0.txt
through the lail before they would believe,87376_0.txt
the prisoner had been taken to,87376_0.txt
Staunton.,87376_0.txt
At midnight last night a special,87376_0.txt
train from Charlottesvi'l brought the,87376_0.txt
prisoner to Staunton to escape the,87376_0.txt
vengeance of the Charlottesville mob.,87376_0.txt
He was lodged in jail at Staunton and,87376_0.txt
taken back back to Charlottesville on,87376_0.txt
the 10:20 train this morning.,87376_0.txt
The following account of the attempt,87376_0.txt
is from the Charlottesville Progress:,87376_0.txt
The city was shocked this morning,87376_0.txt
by the inteligence that Miss Julia,87376_0.txt
"Ho: opp, daughter of the la'e William",87376_0.txt
"Hotopp, had been criminally assaulted",87376_0.txt
"by a negro, near the gate of Pen Park.",87376_0.txt
Pen Park is situated about two and,87376_0.txt
"half miles east of Charlottesville, and",87376_0.txt
is approached by the Earlysville road.,87376_0.txt
Just beyond Cochran's mill the road,87376_0.txt
turns to the right through a boddy of,87376_0.txt
"woods, perhaps a half mile wide, to",87376_0.txt
"the gate of the farm, which is a quarter",87376_0.txt
of a mile from the residence. The,87376_0.txt
point is quite secluded.,87376_0.txt
"The particulars, as learned from the",87376_0.txt
"young lady herself, are about as follows",87376_0.txt
:,87376_0.txt
She came to the city between 8 and,87376_0.txt
o'clock this morning to have her riding,87376_0.txt
horse shod. On her return she,87376_0.txt
"found the gate, which is usually fastened",87376_0.txt
"by a latch, securely bound with a",87376_0.txt
"wire. Surprised at this, she looked",87376_0.txt
"around for the farm hands, supposing",87376_0.txt
there must be some good cause for,87376_0.txt
"fastening the gate thus, but seeing no",87376_0.txt
one she dismounted and unloosed the,87376_0.txt
gate herself. As she turned to re,87376_0.txt
"mount, someone approached her from",87376_0.txt
"behiad and struck her, and then grasped",87376_0.txt
"her by the neck, forcing her to the",87376_0.txt
"ground, when she became unconscious.",87376_0.txt
"When she returned to consciousness,",87376_0.txt
"about 10 o'clock, she looked around but",87376_0.txt
"saw no one, and her horse had gone to",87376_0.txt
"the house, several Lundred yards furth-",87376_0.txt
er on. The horse returning without,87376_0.txt
"the rider startled her brother, Carl",87376_0.txt
"Hotopp, who hastened toward the gate, AN",87376_0.txt
meeting his sister coming. Upon,87376_0.txt
meeting her brother she swooned,87376_0.txt
again.,87376_0.txt
After arriving at the house she again,87376_0.txt
returned to consciousness and told,87376_0.txt
what had befallen her. She describid ung,87376_0.txt
"her assaillant as a very black man, tour",87376_0.txt
"heavy set, slight mustache, wore dark will",87376_0.txt
"clothes, and his toes were sticking out",87376_0.txt
of his shoes. them,87376_0.txt
After this releation Miss,87376_0.txt
"Hotopp again became urconscious, he",87376_0.txt
"and was still in that condition, attended",87376_0.txt
"by several physicians, at last accounts.",87376_0.txt
When the fact became known in the great,87376_0.txt
"city, the indignation was exceedingly as",87376_0.txt
"great, and numbers started out in",87376_0.txt
are,87376_0.txt
"pursuit of the dastard, some on horses, felt",87376_0.txt

the latter two self- confessed accessories,87377_1.txt
"in the murder, were taken from the",87377_1.txt
county jail in Emmons county last,87377_1.txt
night and lynched by a mob. The,87377_1.txt
lynching had been apparently coolly,87377_1.txt
"planned, and was carried out without",87377_1.txt
"a break in the programme, and sudden",87377_1.txt
and swift retribution was meted out,87377_1.txt
by the mob to the murderers.,87377_1.txt
"Williamsport, where the hanging took",87377_1.txt
"place, is about forty miles from this",87377_1.txt
city and off the railroad. The first news,87377_1.txt
of the hanging was received in this city,87377_1.txt
"this afternoon, when a mounted messenger",87377_1.txt
"arrived, his horse lathered with",87377_1.txt
"foam from a swift ride, and announced",87377_1.txt
that the three men had been lynched.,87377_1.txt
"The sheriff of the county, Peter Shier,",87377_1.txt
was in this city at the time the hanging,87377_1.txt
"occurred, and it was to summon",87377_1.txt
him that the messenger rode in hot,87377_1.txt
haste to this city.,87377_1.txt
The men had been under the custody,87377_1.txt
"of Deputy Sheriff Tom Kelly, and they",87377_1.txt
were taken from his custody by the,87377_1.txt
mob and hanged to a beef windlass,87377_1.txt
"several hundred yards from the jail,",87377_1.txt
where their bodies were swinging to,87377_1.txt
"the breeze during all the day, the coroner",87377_1.txt
"not having arrived yet, and no",87377_1.txt
one volunteering to cut them down.,87377_1.txt
There were about forty men concerned,87377_1.txt
in the lynching. They rode into Wil,87377_1.txt
liamsport on horseback late at night,87377_1.txt
and picketed their horses outside the,87377_1.txt
"city, that they might secure them",87377_1.txt
again as speedily as necessary after,87377_1.txt
the deed was done. The jail in which,87377_1.txt
the prisoners were confined is a substantial,87377_1.txt
"stone structure, and was in",87377_1.txt
charge of Deputy Sheriff Thomas Kelly,87377_1.txt
. Since the confinement of the prisoners,87377_1.txt
therein so great has been the fear,87377_1.txt
that they might escape in some way,87377_1.txt
that one man has watched all night,87377_1.txt
"within the jail, and last night Kelly",87377_1.txt
was on watch. There was a meeting,87377_1.txt
of the lodge of Woodmen in a building,87377_1.txt
"near the jail, and, as Kelly was",87377_1.txt
"a member, he expected to meet some",87377_1.txt
of the members of the lodge after the,87377_1.txt
"meeting had adjourned, to consult with",87377_1.txt
them about some matter under consideration,87377_1.txt
by the lodge. To while away,87377_1.txt
the time during the night hours he,87377_1.txt
was playing solitaire at a little table,87377_1.txt
in front of the cells in which the murderers,87377_1.txt
were confined. At about 2 o'clock,87377_1.txt
in the morning,87377_1.txt
THERE WAS A RAP,87377_1.txt
"at the outer door of the jail, and",87377_1.txt
Kelly arose quickly and turned,87377_1.txt
the,87377_1.txt
"key in the lock, thinking that the",87377_1.txt
persons he expected to meet had arrived,87377_1.txt
. No sooner had he opened the,87377_1.txt
door than the members of the mob,87377_1.txt
crowded into the small jail corridor.,87377_1.txt
"All of them were masked, and the",87377_1.txt
"leaders carried ropes, purchased new",87377_1.txt
for the occasion. Kelly at once realized,87377_1.txt
that the mob had come after his,87377_1.txt
prisoners. The lynchers were quiet,87377_1.txt
but determined. The leader presented,87377_1.txt
a revolver at the head of the deputy,87377_1.txt
sheriff and told him they wanted his,87377_1.txt
"prisoners, and demanded that he open",87377_1.txt
the cells in which they were confined.,87377_1.txt
"Kelly demurred, but the leader of the",87377_1.txt
mob told him that they desired to,87377_1.txt
"gain access to the cells, and, while",87377_1.txt
"they did not want to harm him, it was",87377_1.txt
"useless for him to resist, as the were",87377_1.txt
in force. Kelly saw that resistance,87377_1.txt
was useless and unlocked the cells.,87377_1.txt
Two of the prisoners were confined in,87377_1.txt
"one cell, and the other in a separate",87377_1.txt
cell. They had been aroused from,87377_1.txt
"sleep by the entrance of the men, and",87377_1.txt
sat up half awake and trembling with,87377_1.txt
terror. Holy Track and Ireland were,87377_1.txt
"dragged from their beds, ropes were",87377_1.txt
fastened about their necks and they,87377_1.txt
"were dragged out of the jail building,",87377_1.txt
after being told to prepare for death.,87377_1.txt
The mob had more consideration,87377_1.txt
"Coudot, since the other two had con for",87377_1.txt
"fessed their crime, but Coudot had",87377_1.txt
"not, and the mob desired to learn",87377_1.txt
from him whether the two others were,87377_1.txt
guilty who are under arrest for the,87377_1.txt
crime. The self- confessed murderers,87377_1.txt
were dragged across the space intervening,87377_1.txt
between the jail and the wind,87377_1.txt
"less, upon which they were hanged",87377_1.txt
"without ceremony, reaching that spot",87377_1.txt
more dead than alive. Coudot was,87377_1.txt
to walk. He made a slight re,87377_1.txt
"allowed sistance, but it was futile. There are",87377_1.txt
"no trees in the vicinity of the scaffold,",87377_1.txt
and the mob was first at a loss for a,87377_1.txt
scaffold. The men were hurried to an,87377_1.txt
"adjacent well, and an attempt made",87377_1.txt
"to hang them from the curbing, but",87377_1.txt
it proved impossible. They were then,87377_1.txt
"dragged to a log shack near by, and",87377_1.txt
an attempt was made to hang them,87377_1.txt
"from the ends of the projecting logs,",87377_1.txt
but this effort also proved unavailing.,87377_1.txt
"A huge beef windlass, which had been",87377_1.txt
erected to suspend the carcasses of,87377_1.txt
"beeves, then offered the",87377_1.txt
slaughtered,87377_1.txt
"means sought for, and the men were",87377_1.txt
"dragged to this, and",87377_1.txt
STRUNG UP ON A CROSS BEAM.,87377_1.txt
Coudet was the first man to be,87377_1.txt
reported that he was,87377_1.txt
hanged. It is,87377_1.txt
asked before he was hanged whether,87377_1.txt
Black Hawk and Defender had also,87377_1.txt
been concerned in the murder for,87377_1.txt
which he was about to be,87377_1.txt
and answered that,87377_1.txt
"hanged,",87377_1.txt
had been. The rope,87377_1.txt
they,87377_1.txt
fastened about his,87377_1.txt
which had been,87377_1.txt
neck was then thrown over the cross,87377_1.txt
"beam, and he was raised off the ground",87377_1.txt
and suspended in air. Holy Track and,87377_1.txt
Ireland were so nearly unconscious,87377_1.txt
from the effects of the dragging that,87377_1.txt
they did not realize what was about,87377_1.txt
to happen when the ropes about their,87377_1.txt
necks were tossed over the same beam.,87377_1.txt
They were unable to stand and were,87377_1.txt
slowly raised from the ground on which,87377_1.txt
they lay until their bodies swung into,87377_1.txt
the air and dangled from the windlass,87377_1.txt
"with that of Coudot, and the three",87377_1.txt
bodies swayed to and fro in the bright,87377_1.txt
"moonlight, a ghastly spectacle. The",87377_1.txt
"mob then dispersed, mounted their",87377_1.txt
horses and rode away.,87377_1.txt
The residents of Williamsport had,87377_1.txt
been aroused by this time to the fact,87377_1.txt
that something unusual was in progress,87377_1.txt
", and made their appearance from",87377_1.txt
the scattered houses in the little ham,87377_1.txt
let and gazed with alarm at the spectacle,87377_1.txt
. The night was a bright moonlight,87377_1.txt
"one, and the actions of the mob",87377_1.txt
were plainly discernible from a considerable,87377_1.txt
distance. A few women gazed,87377_1.txt
", awe struck at the hanging of the",87377_1.txt
"murderers, from the shadow of their",87377_1.txt
houses. There was no attempt,87377_1.txt
to interfere,87377_1.txt
"with the mob, and there was",87377_1.txt
no noise of disturbance on the part,87377_1.txt
of the mob. They worked quietly,87377_1.txt
and with determination. They were in,87377_1.txt
sufficient force to have overcome any,87377_1.txt
resistance that might have been offered,87377_1.txt
", and, as there is no such thing",87377_1.txt
as a militia company or other like body,87377_1.txt
"in the vicinity, and only a few residents",87377_1.txt
"of the town, there was no one",87377_1.txt
to offer any opposition to the lynching.,87377_1.txt
HOW TWO ESCAPED.,87377_1.txt
There were two other men alleged to,87377_1.txt
have been implicated in the murders,87377_1.txt
"for which the three were lynched, and",87377_1.txt
they were saved from the same fate,87377_1.txt
by the fact that they are confined in,87377_1.txt
"the Burleigh county jail at Bismarck,",87377_1.txt
forty miles The mob would,87377_1.txt
away.,87377_1.txt
"like to have secured them also, and, if",87377_1.txt
"they had been within reach, there is",87377_1.txt
no doubt that they would have shared,87377_1.txt
the fate of their comrades. But when,87377_1.txt
Coud,87377_1.txt
Coudot was tried and sentenced to,87377_1.txt
"death, the other two men were ordered",87377_1.txt
confined in the jail at Bismarck for,87377_1.txt
"the reason that the Emmons county,",87377_1.txt
of the men.,87377_1.txt
jail had not facilities to confine all five,87377_1.txt
It is said that the lynching was precipitated,87377_1.txt
by a recent decision of the,87377_1.txt
supreme court of the state granting a,87377_1.txt
"new trial to the Indian Coudot, the",87377_1.txt
only one of the five men who had been,87377_1.txt
tried and found guilty of the crime.,87377_1.txt
Lynching has been feared ever since,87377_1.txt
"the men were first apprehended, but",87377_1.txt
the residents of the county stated that,87377_1.txt
they desired to see the men have a fair,87377_1.txt
trial. Coudot was the first man to be,87377_1.txt
"tried, and he was convicted and sentenced",87377_1.txt
to be hanged on Oct. 29 last. His,87377_1.txt
case was appealed to the supreme court,87377_1.txt
on the ground that he had been convicted,87377_1.txt
upon the testimony of an accomplice,87377_1.txt
", Paul Holy Track, and that",87377_1.txt
that testimony had not been corroborated,87377_1.txt
. Upon this appeal the supreme,87377_1.txt
court decided to grant Coudot a new,87377_1.txt
"trial, holding that there had been no",87377_1.txt
corroboration of the testimony of the,87377_1.txt
"accomplice, and that the evidence in",87377_1.txt
the case did not warrant a conviction.,87377_1.txt
Unless the prosecution had additional,87377_1.txt
"testimony to produce, this decision",87377_1.txt
would have resulted in the discharge,87377_1.txt
of the men. This prospect raised a,87377_1.txt
wave of indignation throughout the,87377_1.txt
"county, which has resulted in",87377_1.txt
lynching early this morning. the,87377_1.txt
THE CRIME,87377_1.txt
for which the three men were hanged,87377_1.txt
was one of the most horrible in the,87377_1.txt
annals of brutality and atrocity. On,87377_1.txt
Feb. 17 last a passer entering the house,87377_1.txt
"of Rev. Thomas Spicer, a Methodist",87377_1.txt
"circuit rider, discovered the dead body",87377_1.txt
"of his mother- in- law, Mrs. Ellen Wal",87377_1.txt
"dron, lying upon the floor of the parlor",87377_1.txt
", horribly mutilated. Passing to",87377_1.txt
another room he found the body of,87377_1.txt
"Mrs. William Rouse, a daughter of",87377_1.txt
"Spicer, also dead, with her twin baby",87377_1.txt
"boys brutally murdered, their brains",87377_1.txt
"having been dashed out, and Mrs.",87377_1.txt
Rouse having been killed with a club.,87377_1.txt
At the barn was found the body of,87377_1.txt
"Mrs. Spicer, likewise horribly",87377_1.txt
"lated, she having been shot, and after muti",87377_1.txt
"wards stabbed with a pitchfork, her",87377_1.txt
"breast being filled with wounds, and",87377_1.txt
her head crushed with an ax. Inside,87377_1.txt
the barn was the body of Thomas,87377_1.txt
"Spicer, who had been shot through",87377_1.txt
"the back with a shotgun, and his",87377_1.txt
throat cut from ear to ear. The spectacle,87377_1.txt
"was sickening, and the crime",87377_1.txt
created most intense excitement and,87377_1.txt
victims were,87377_1.txt
indignation The six,87377_1.txt
.,87377_1.txt
For,87377_1.txt
buried in graves side by side.,87377_1.txt
some time there was no clue to the,87377_1.txt
"murderers, but the officers finally arrested",87377_1.txt
an Indian half- breed named,87377_1.txt
Coudot and a negro half- breed named,87377_1.txt
"Black Hawk, upon suspicion of having",87377_1.txt
been concerned in the erime. Not long,87377_1.txt
afterwards rings and jewelry that had,87377_1.txt
disappeared from the Spicer house,87377_1.txt
at the time of the murder were found,87377_1.txt
in the possession of a young full- blooded,87377_1.txt
"Indian, Paul Holy Track, and he,",87377_1.txt
"with a companion, Phiip Ireland, was",87377_1.txt
arrested. They having been confined,87377_1.txt
"in jail for several days, the two boys",87377_1.txt
made a complete confession of the,87377_1.txt
"crime, implicating Black Hawk, Coudot",87377_1.txt
and an Indian named George Defender.,87377_1.txt
All of the men were arrested and,87377_1.txt
"lodged in jail. Prior to the trial, Cou",87377_1.txt
dot made an attempt at suicide by,87377_1.txt
stabbing himself with a knife. Coudot,87377_1.txt
also made a statement in which he,87377_1.txt
accused Black Hawk of the crime. The,87377_1.txt
trials of the men were begun at Will,87377_1.txt
iamsport last July. The young In,87377_1.txt
dians went on the stand and recited,87377_1.txt
"the story of the murders, a narrative",87377_1.txt

The testimony showed that the idea,87377_1.txt
of killing some family in the vicinity,87377_1.txt
of Winona for their money was conceived,87377_1.txt
"by the two men, Black Hawk",87377_1.txt
"and Coudot. On Feb. 11, the Indian,",87377_1.txt
"Holy Track, who had known Black",87377_1.txt
"Hawk for thirteen years, met Black",87377_1.txt
Hawk on the bank of the river in the,87377_1.txt
timber between Winona and the Standing,87377_1.txt
Rock agency. Holy Track was on,87377_1.txt
his way to Winona to buy whisky.,87377_1.txt
"The two had a rambling conversation,",87377_1.txt
and Black Hawk called attention to,87377_1.txt
the number of cattle in the vicinity,87377_1.txt
"that had no brands, and suggested",87377_1.txt
that they kill some of them and sell,87377_1.txt
the beef. From this the conversation,87377_1.txt
was skillfully led about by Black Hawk,87377_1.txt
"to the subject of murder, and he asked",87377_1.txt
young Holy Track what he thought,87377_1.txt
of the idea of killing some neighboring,87377_1.txt
family for their money. The young,87377_1.txt
"Indian acquiesced in the plan, and",87377_1.txt
Black Hawk gave him a bottle of whisky,87377_1.txt
to,87377_1.txt
SEAL THE COMPACT.,87377_1.txt
On the following Saturday Holy,87377_1.txt
"Track met Coudot at the agency, and",87377_1.txt
"the two went down under a hill near,",87377_1.txt
"to talk over some matters, at the re",87377_1.txt
When they arrived,87377_1.txt
quest of Coudot.,87377_1.txt
at a secluded place Coudot asked the,87377_1.txt
other man if he had ever had any conversation,87377_1.txt
"with Black Hawk, and Holy",87377_1.txt
Track said he had. Then Coudot asked,87377_1.txt
"him what he thought of the plan, and",87377_1.txt
Holy Track said it was all right and,87377_1.txt
that he was willing. The Indian De,87377_1.txt
fender made his appearance shortly after,87377_1.txt
"the two had come to an agreement,",87377_1.txt
and was informed by Coudot that Holy,87377_1.txt
Track was willing to enter into the,87377_1.txt
"scheme of murder, showing that De",87377_1.txt
fender was already cognizant of what,87377_1.txt
had been proposed by Black Hawk.,87377_1.txt
"After some discussion, the murderers",87377_1.txt
"settled upon the Spicer family, because",87377_1.txt
there was known to be only one old,87377_1.txt
"man there, and the erime could be accomplished",87377_1.txt
without danger to the murderers,87377_1.txt

A few days later Coudot again saw,87377_1.txt
"the Indian Holy Track and said that,",87377_1.txt
if they did the deed at the time,87377_1.txt
"upon between them and Black agreed Hawk,",87377_1.txt
and the latter was one of the participants,87377_1.txt
", he would get all the money, as",87377_1.txt
he had cheated them in sundry criminal,87377_1.txt
"negotiations before. Accordingly,",87377_1.txt
he proposed that they do the killing,87377_1.txt
"on the following day, before the time",87377_1.txt
that Black Hawk had suggested it be,87377_1.txt
"done, and steal a march on him. Holy",87377_1.txt
Track agreed to this. He had already,87377_1.txt
"told young Philip Ireland of the plan,",87377_1.txt
"and the boy had agreed to it, under the",87377_1.txt
influence of the older Indians. On the,87377_1.txt
"following day, Feb. 17, Holy Track and",87377_1.txt
"Ireland rode to the Spicer place, according",87377_1.txt
"to a previously arranged plan,",87377_1.txt
and waited there for the arrival of,87377_1.txt
"Coudot and Defender, when the",87377_1.txt

They arrived shortly after noon. The,87377_1.txt

for the arrival of the other men.,87377_1.txt
"When they came, which was after some",87377_1.txt

in Indian what number of persons were,87377_1.txt
"at the house, and, upon being told, said",87377_1.txt
he would take the horses they had,87377_1.txt
"ridden down into the timber, and then",87377_1.txt
come back and help do the killing. All,87377_1.txt
"of the men were drunk, and the pro",87377_1.txt
posed murder was thus discussed in,87377_1.txt
Indian in the presence of Mrs. Spicer.,87377_1.txt
After the two men had gone out she,87377_1.txt
"asked Holy Track what they had said,",87377_1.txt
and he told her they were hungry and,87377_1.txt
"had not had their dinner, to which",87377_1.txt
she responded that if she had known,87377_1.txt
that she would have given them their,87377_1.txt
dinner. She noticed their evident intoxication,87377_1.txt

there quite a long time before Coudot and,87377_1.txt
Defender came back. The old man( Spicer),87377_1.txt
"was hauling farm refuse. Defender, Coudot",87377_1.txt
"and myself were inside, and when Spicer",87377_1.txt
would go out we would go behind the door,87377_1.txt
"and take a drink. Finally, when he went out",87377_1.txt
"with a load, Coudot told me to shoot, and I",87377_1.txt

"I would do it, and the next time started",87377_1.txt

up the pitchfork and jabbed him. Philip came,87377_1.txt
"in the stable then, and Defender told him to",87377_1.txt
"go and get the shovel and hit him, and he",87377_1.txt
"did. I told Philip to load up the gun again,",87377_1.txt
and I went in and took another drink. After,87377_1.txt
we had all gone inside of the stable again,87377_1.txt
Defender wanted to go up and bring Mrs.,87377_1.txt
"Spicer down, and he would not do it so I",87377_1.txt
went. I went up to the house and told her,87377_1.txt
"that her man wanted her, and she wanted to",87377_1.txt
know if the Indians had come to buy her,87377_1.txt
horse and I told her yes. When we got close,87377_1.txt
to the stable I ran in and told Defender to,87377_1.txt
"shoot, and he said he couldn't so I took the",87377_1.txt
gun and just as she got inside the door I,87377_1.txt
shot her. Philip went and stabbed her with,87377_1.txt
"the fork, and Defender hit her with an ax,",87377_1.txt
and Coudot hit her with a shovel. We came,87377_1.txt
out of the stable and drank two bottles of,87377_1.txt

"going in I heard the women crying, and I",87377_1.txt
"threw away a cordwood stick I had, and",87377_1.txt
picked up a branding iron. Coudot went in,87377_1.txt
"first, and when I got in he was lying on the",87377_1.txt

struck over the door. After striking the door,87377_1.txt

she struck me over the head with a hoe. The,87377_1.txt
"blood ran down in my eyes, and I dropped",87377_1.txt

Shier late this afternoon from the messenger,87377_1.txt
who rode up from Williamsport.,87377_1.txt
He was shocked to learn that the men,87377_1.txt
"had met with mob violence, but",87377_1.txt
there have been threats of lynching as,87377_1.txt
"ever since the men were arrested, and",87377_1.txt
he has several times had to exercise,87377_1.txt
considerable strategy to remove the,87377_1.txt
murderers from one place to another,87377_1.txt
without letting them fall into the,87377_1.txt
hands of the mob he was not altogeth-,87377_1.txt
",",87377_1.txt
er unprepared for such news. Had the,87377_1.txt
sheriff been there at the time of the,87377_1.txt
"affair, it is doubtful if it would have",87377_1.txt
"passed off as quietly as it did, as he is",87377_1.txt
a courageous officer and would not,87377_1.txt
have surrendered the men without a,87377_1.txt
struggle. He left at once upon receipt,87377_1.txt
of the news for Williamsport to,87377_1.txt
take action in the matter. Gov. Briggs,87377_1.txt
"is out of the state, and a message was",87377_1.txt
sent to him this afternoon apprising,87377_1.txt
him of the lynching. What action will,87377_1.txt
be taken by the authorities remains to,87377_1.txt
be seen. It is doubtful if any of the,87377_1.txt
men who took part in the affair can be,87377_1.txt
identified. The sentiment in Emmons,87377_1.txt
"county is all against the men, and,",87377_1.txt
while there will be regret at the fact,87377_1.txt
that the mob took the matter into their,87377_1.txt
"own hands, few, if any, will admit that",87377_1.txt
the fate of the men was undeserved.,87377_1.txt
Memory of their awful crime is still,87377_1.txt
"fresh, and there is no doubt in the",87377_1.txt
minds of the residents of that county,87377_1.txt
that the men were guilty.,87377_1.txt
The Standing Rock Indian reservation,87377_1.txt
is only about fifty miles from the,87377_1.txt
scene of the lynching. The better class,87377_1.txt

"for the murderers, and at the time of",87377_1.txt
the confession of the crime applied to,87377_1.txt
the Indian authorities to take the In,87377_1.txt
"dians out and shoot them, after their",87377_1.txt
"fashion of punishing murderers, but",87377_1.txt
there is no doubt that the victims had,87377_1.txt
"friends on the reservation, and what",87377_1.txt
complications may arise cannot be told.,87377_1.txt
The Indians may seek revenge for the,87377_1.txt

have all along stated that they were,87377_1.txt
"satisfied to have them hanged legally,",87377_1.txt

It. His construction was that both,87418_0.txt
"of the act should be taken together, and sections they",87418_0.txt
referred only to the lynching of prisoners or,87418_0.txt

there were several negroes there and they are,87427_0.txt
known as a rather dangerous gang. A,87427_0.txt
moment later another negro who was outside,87427_0.txt
the door called Kenny a vile name and told,87427_0.txt
him to come outside and he would show him,87427_0.txt
what they would do for him. He went to the,87427_0.txt
"door, and as soon as he was on the steps King",87427_0.txt

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.,87429_0.txt
Lynch Law and Preventive.,87429_0.txt
To the Editor of The Post.,87429_0.txt
"Brenham, Texas, July 15, 1897.- After",87429_0.txt
reading the many and varied remedies sug-,87429_0.txt
ested in The Post regarding lynchings,87429_0.txt
in Texas I desire to state my own views,87429_0.txt
and conclusions as to the best course to,87429_0.txt
Junsue in restraining and mitigating the,87429_0.txt
evil.,87429_0.txt
"First, the incentive to lynch springs from",87429_0.txt
an inborn impulse to resent and avenge a,87429_0.txt
heinous crime. The delays of the law has,87429_0.txt
nothing to do in prompting the action of,87429_0.txt
the mob. This is shown in the action of,87429_0.txt
a mob in Maryland a few days since who,87429_0.txt
"met a brute at the court house door, who",87429_0.txt
had just been tried and sentenced,87429_0.txt
to ath,87429_0.txt
and hanged him to a telegraph pole.,87429_0.txt
Under that impulse they would snatch,87429_0.txt
criminal from the gallows and hang,87429_0.txt
him. Giving the court authority to convene,87429_0.txt
the court and grand jury at once,87429_0.txt
"to try the criminal, will avail nothing unless",87429_0.txt
"the court can beat the mob, which it",87429_0.txt
"can't do, for while the court is getting together",87429_0.txt
", the mob will have done its work.",87429_0.txt
The spirit that moves the mob is that they,87429_0.txt
"themselves must be the executioners, because",87429_0.txt
they are moved by a personal feel-,87429_0.txt
of revenge. That the action of another,87429_0.txt
will not appease.,87429_0.txt
"Hence, the late law will prove as futile",87429_0.txt
as the former. providing for a speedy,87429_0.txt
trial will not in Its the least satisfy or af-,87429_0.txt
In anyway secure conviction the of the,87429_0.txt
fect the mob. Nor will a change of venue,87429_0.txt
In anyway secure the conviction of the,87429_0.txt
lynchers.,87429_0.txt
The other day I asked a man if he favored,87429_0.txt
lynch law and with great omphasia,87429_0.txt
",",87429_0.txt
he said civilized people would permit it,87429_0.txt
"no,",87429_0.txt
and that it could not be sanctioned by rny,87429_0.txt
individual. I said suppose your own,87429_0.txt
daughter were the victim of an assault little by,87429_0.txt
"te mobbed"" p. d. q."" In this expression",87429_0.txt
human nature crops out pretty strong.,87429_0.txt
As long as it is somebody else we feel,87429_0.txt
Inclined to let the law take its course.,87429_0.txt
But when the horrid crime,87429_0.txt
is perpetrated,87429_0.txt
in our own household with all our soul we,87429_0.txt
call,87429_0.txt
upon our neighbors,87429_0.txt
to help lynch the,87429_0.txt
"brute. This is the feeling of the individual,",87429_0.txt
and what is a mob but a number of in-,87429_0.txt
dividuals of like feeling and impulses?,87429_0.txt
"Now, when one of these heinous crimes",87429_0.txt
has been committed and the perpetrator,87429_0.txt
been lynched and the lynchers brought to,87429_0.txt
"trial, canvass public sentiment",87429_0.txt
to,87429_0.txt
"whether they should be punished, and the",87429_0.txt
"average juryman will say,"" If I were on",87429_0.txt
the jury in such a case I would not hang,87429_0.txt
"a good man for lynching such a brute.""",87429_0.txt
Verdicts,87429_0.txt
are generally the echo of pub-,87429_0.txt
1io sentiment. The jurors are drawn from,87429_0.txt
the public and who,87429_0.txt
", are Individually possessed",87429_0.txt
of,87429_0.txt
that sentiment. No jury with,87429_0.txt
change the venue and try in a county ot,87429_0.txt
excited by the crime. Human nature is,87429_0.txt
"the same the world over, and on proof of",87429_0.txt
the facts the result of the trial will be,87429_0.txt
the same.,87429_0.txt
It is not my purpose to justify lynchings.,87429_0.txt
"nor to condemn them, but to simply state",87429_0.txt
stubborn facts and conditions that always,87429_0.txt
have and always will prove,87429_0.txt
barriers to convictions in such insumountable cases.,87429_0.txt
"Some offenses are, by common consent,",87429_0.txt
beyond the pale of the law. If the affections,87429_0.txt
of a man's wife are alienated by an,87429_0.txt
"other and he is slain by the husband, who",87429_0.txt
ever heard of the slayers conviction? And,87429_0.txt
"yet, in law, it is as much murder as in",87429_0.txt
the case of lynching. But a short time,87429_0.txt
"since, a judge in Louisiana announced from",87429_0.txt
the bench in trying such a case that cus-,87429_0.txt
tom and tradition in the South had given,87429_0.txt
the right to slay in such cases the force,87429_0.txt
of rights that is,87429_0.txt
higher than the constitution and laws.,87429_0.txt
"Now, the same public sentiment that",87429_0.txt
protects the husband is a powerful factor,87429_0.txt
in case of assaults upon women.,87429_0.txt
"Weil, to use a common but expressive",87429_0.txt
"phrase, what are we going to do about it",87429_0.txt
"It can not be prevented by legislation, and?",87429_0.txt
"all we can hope to do is to restrain, con-",87429_0.txt
"trol or mitigate the evil, in my opinion,",87429_0.txt
by legislation on the following lines: Pass,87429_0.txt
a law clearly defining certain heinous offenses,87429_0.txt
to be affected by the law. When,87429_0.txt
one of the defined crimes has been committed,87429_0.txt
and the perpetrator lynched arrest,87429_0.txt
"and try the lynchers as in other offenses,",87429_0.txt
except that the only issue tried shall be:,87429_0.txt

fense charged against him? And on satisfactory,87429_0.txt
proof that he was that the lyuchers,87429_0.txt
or,87429_0.txt
"Now, when a mob assembles, there are",87429_0.txt
always some men more level- headed and,87429_0.txt
cautious than others. The mob does not,87429_0.txt
"desire to punish an innocent man, which",87429_0.txt
is the one great danger in lynch law. Now.,87429_0.txt

a frightened negro cowered before,87513_0.txt
a crowd of resolute men. They were,87513_0.txt
wild with anger. He trembled like a,87513_0.txt
"leaf, and between his gasps for breath",87513_0.txt
implored his captors to be merciful.,87513_0.txt
Their answer was a burst of righteous,87513_0.txt
wrath. He threw his black hands be,87513_0.txt
fore his face fearful of their vengeance.,87513_0.txt
And when one of the crowd appeared,87513_0.txt
In the doorway with a long rope in his,87513_0.txt
hands the negro dropped to his knees,87513_0.txt
and begged for mercy. It was in vain.,87513_0.txt
In an instant the noose was made and,87513_0.txt
slipped about his neck. He was,87513_0.txt
dragged to a large tree in the yard,87513_0.txt
and the rope was thrown over a stout,87513_0.txt
limb. Willing hands grasped the,87513_0.txt
long line and a minute more and the,87513_0.txt
negro was dangling in the air. At,87513_0.txt
that instant a frightened woman is,87513_0.txt
"sued from the house and, falling to her",87513_0.txt
"knees, implored the men to do nothing",87513_0.txt
SO rash. Her entreaties prevailed.,87513_0.txt
Reluctantly the rope slackened and,87513_0.txt
the burden at the other end slipped,87513_0.txt
"slowly to the ground, while the short,",87513_0.txt

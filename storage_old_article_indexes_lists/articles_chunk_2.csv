"years has answered for their needs,",8863_0.txt
and construct another that will be,8863_0.txt
free from the taint of being haunted.,8863_0.txt
For some years the story that ghosts,8863_0.txt
were common visitors in the vicinity,8863_0.txt
of the Walnut Grove schoolhouse have,8863_0.txt
"been current, but the trustees, who",8863_0.txt
"are hard- headed types of Hoosiers,",8863_0.txt
have always refused to give any credence,8863_0.txt
to the reports. They have lived,8863_0.txt
In hope that the stories would be for-,8863_0.txt
"gotten, and have done all that was in",8863_0.txt
their power to cast ridicule upon the,8863_0.txt
rumors. Their course was dictated by,8863_0.txt
"two motives. In the first place, they",8863_0.txt
"did not believe in ghosts, and in the",8863_0.txt
"second, they had an investment in the",8863_0.txt
schoolhouse and rescuted the circulation,8863_0.txt
of stories that were liable to ira-,8863_0.txt
pair its value and usefulness.,8863_0.txt
"From the standpoint of the trustees,",8863_0.txt
this action on their part was all right.,8863_0.txt
but it did not meet with the approva:,8863_0.txt
of the parents of the children who bad,8863_0.txt
to attend the school. When little,8863_0.txt
"Johnny Jones and his sister Sue, for",8863_0.txt
"instance, came screaming home to",8863_0.txt
their mother and told her of seeing a,8863_0.txt
man swinging by the neck to a tree in,8863_0.txt
the immediate vicinity of the schoolhouse,8863_0.txt
", and that the hanging man",8863_0.txt
amused himself by making ugly faces,8863_0.txt
"at them, it became a matter of moment",8863_0.txt
"to the parents, especially as little",8863_0.txt
Johnny and his sister Sue almost,8863_0.txt
went into spasms when told to go to,8863_0.txt
school as usual the next day. The,8863_0.txt
story of Johnny and a's sister had corroboration,8863_0.txt
from other children who attended,8863_0.txt
"the school, and finally the parents",8863_0.txt
began to withdraw their children,8863_0.txt
from the place and send them to this,8863_0.txt
city or to some other place to get an,8863_0.txt
education.,8863_0.txt
Sometimes the ghost varied his,8863_0.txt
"pearance, and instead of hanging from",8863_0.txt
"the tree, would be seen strolling along",8863_0.txt
"the road, his head very much on one",8863_0.txt
"side, his tongue hanging out of his",8863_0.txt
"mouth, and an expression of indescribable",8863_0.txt
agony on his face. The children,8863_0.txt
said that they would no more than get,8863_0.txt
a glimpse of him when he would disappear,8863_0.txt
in the most unaccountable manner,8863_0.txt
. The ghost would be walking on,8863_0.txt
the road where there was not an object,8863_0.txt
"to afford him concealment, when,",8863_0.txt
presto! he would be gone.,8863_0.txt
The children and the parents said,8863_0.txt
that it was Amer Green's ghost. The,8863_0.txt
"school trustees said"" fiddlesticks,"" but",8863_0.txt
the parents stuck to their belief and,8863_0.txt
accentuated it by withdrawing their,8863_0.txt
children from the school. At the last,8863_0.txt
"term of the school, the one that has",8863_0.txt
"just closed, there were only two scholars",8863_0.txt
", and at its termination the teacher",8863_0.txt
told the trustees that she could not endure,8863_0.txt
the life at the school for another,8863_0.txt
"term, and must leave. The trustees",8863_0.txt
tried to get a teacher to take the,8863_0.txt
"school for the fall term, but its fame",8863_0.txt
as a ghost- haunted place had become,8863_0.txt
"noised abroad, and the quest of the",8863_0.txt
trustees was unsuccessful. In view,8863_0.txt
"of this fact ,, and in deference to the",8863_0.txt
wishes of the taxpayers the trustees,8863_0.txt
have awarded the contracts for the,8863_0.txt
erection of another schoolhouse in lieu,8863_0.txt
of the old one. It will have another,8863_0.txt
"site, and the hope is that the ghost of",8863_0.txt
Amer Green will not in future bother,8863_0.txt
the children and interrupt their education,8863_0.txt
.,8863_0.txt
The slim attendance at the school the,8863_0.txt
"last term, as well as the change of",8863_0.txt
"heart on the part of the trustees, was",8863_0.txt
largely due to the apparition that appeared,8863_0.txt
to Dr. Budford Karns of this,8863_0.txt
city one night last fail. Dr. Karns s,8863_0.txt
"not an emotional man, and his repи-",8863_0.txt
tation for truth and veracity are unquestioned,8863_0.txt
. The doctor had been,8863_0.txt
making a professional call in the Walnut,8863_0.txt
Grove neighborhood on the night,8863_0.txt
"of November 30, and had to pass the",8863_0.txt
vicinity of the schoolhouse on his way,8863_0.txt
home. While passing,8863_0.txt
a grove of,8863_0.txt
trees near the schoolhouse he saw the,8863_0.txt
body of a man hanging from a limb,8863_0.txt
and swaying back and forth. When,8863_0.txt
the doctor told of what he had seen,8863_0.txt
"the next day it settled the matter, and",8863_0.txt
the fate of the old schoolhouse was,8863_0.txt
assured.,8863_0.txt
While there has not been anything,8863_0.txt
new discovered to account for the appearance,8863_0.txt
of the ghost or the unearthly,8863_0.txt
noises that have terrified the children,8863_0.txt
"at school, there is only one belief on",8863_0.txt
"the subject, and that is that the uncanny",8863_0.txt
object is the ghost of Amer,8863_0.txt
Green. On a walnut,8863_0.txt
tree in the vicinity,8863_0.txt
of the schoolhouse some years,8863_0.txt
ago Amer Green was strung up by,8863_0.txt
lynch law and his body left hanging,8863_0.txt
there. In view of the appearance of,8863_0.txt
the ghost so frequently and its apparent,8863_0.txt
"inability to rest, the community is",8863_0.txt
now beginning to take some stock in,8863_0.txt
Amer's dying declaration that he was,8863_0.txt
innocent of the crime for which he was,8863_0.txt
"lynched ,, and that he will never rest",8863_0.txt
in his grave until his innocence is,8863_0.txt
made plain.,8863_0.txt
Amer Green was known in the neighborhood,8863_0.txt
"as a"" terror"" and was a generally",8863_0.txt
notorious character.,8863_0.txt
He was,8863_0.txt
"an admirer of Luella Mabbit, the",8863_0.txt
"daughter of William Mabbit, a well-",8863_0.txt
to- do farmer living near Young America,8863_0.txt
", thirteen miles northeast of here.",8863_0.txt
Mabbit did not approve of the intimacy,8863_0.txt
"of his daughter with Green, and at his",8863_0.txt
command the girl wrote her admirer,8863_0.txt
a letter requesting that he abandon,8863_0.txt
his suit for her hand.,8863_0.txt
Such a request did not suit the impetuous,8863_0.txt
"nature of Green, who became",8863_0.txt
greatly enraged at the girl's letter and,8863_0.txt
made numerous threats of what he,8863_0.txt
"would do. August 19, 1886, Green, in",8863_0.txt
"company with William Walker, called",8863_0.txt
at the Mabbit house in the evening.,8863_0.txt
and asked to see Luella. Her sister,8863_0.txt
"Cynthia, now Mrs. Walker, went to",8863_0.txt
the door and told Green that Luella,8863_0.txt
had gone to bed and did not wish to,8863_0.txt
"get Jp Green raved at hearing this,",8863_0.txt
and finally. Luella got up and dressed,8863_0.txt
and she and Green went out together.,8863_0.txt
Cynthia went to bed and there was no,8863_0.txt
one else in the house who knew that,8863_0.txt
Luella and Green had gone out together,8863_0.txt
.,8863_0.txt
That was the last seen of Luella,8863_0.txt
Mabbit alive. When she did not return,8863_0.txt
"home a search was made for her,",8863_0.txt
but no trace could be found. Green,8863_0.txt
was arrested on the charge of murder,8863_0.txt
and placed in jail at Delphia. Almost,8863_0.txt
"six months afterward, on February 5,",8863_0.txt
"1887, the body of a woman W33",8863_0.txt
fished out of the rive some tailes below,8863_0.txt
"Lafayette, and some of the relatives",8863_0.txt
of the girl recognized the corpse,8863_0.txt
as that of Luella. There were doubts,8863_0.txt
"then, and always have been since, a:",8863_0.txt
to the value of the identification. When,8863_0.txt
the Coroner's jury held an inquest on,8863_0.txt
the body picked cut of the river the,8863_0.txt
verdict was that it was the body of,8863_0.txt
"Luella Babbit, and that she came to",8863_0.txt
her .nd at the hands of Green. He was,8863_0.txt
"held for the crime, but the State officials",8863_0.txt
found so much diflculty in,8863_0.txt
tracing his movements the night he,8863_0.txt
had gone out with Luella that the trial,8863_0.txt
was put off time and again in order,8863_0.txt
that they might make out a case,8863_0.txt
against him.,8863_0.txt
This delay was not understood or ap.,8863_0.txt
"preciated by the community, which",8863_0.txt
was terribly aroused over the disappearance,8863_0.txt
"of the girl, and was fearful",8863_0.txt
"that her abductor and murderer, as",8863_0.txt
"they judged Green to be, might escape",8863_0.txt
punishment on some technicality.,8863_0.txt
"It was resolved that Green, must die.",8863_0.txt
About 10 o'clock on the night of,8863_0.txt
"October 21, 1887, a mob surrounded",8863_0.txt
the jail at Delphia and called on the,8863_0.txt
sheriff for the keys. When he refused,8863_0.txt
to give them up the mob attacked the,8863_0.txt
jail with cold chisels and sledge hammers,8863_0.txt
", and socn forced an entrance.",8863_0.txt
"Green was taken out, placed in a wagon",8863_0.txt
"with a guard, and then the mob",8863_0.txt
"climbed in to their vehicles, which",8863_0.txt
"were standing around, and the procession",8863_0.txt
came up its route to Walnut,8863_0.txt
Grove.,8863_0.txt
When they got there Green was confronted,8863_0.txt
"with Mr. Mabbit, and to the",8863_0.txt
latter's question as to what he had,8863_0.txt
done with Luella swore that the girl,8863_0.txt
was alive and well and was then living,8863_0.txt
"at Fort Wayne, Tex. Mr. Mabbit",8863_0.txt
and the mob were of the opinion that,8863_0.txt
this was a lie and was told for the,8863_0.txt
"purpose of gaining time, so without",8863_0.txt
any more parley the rope that had,8863_0.txt
been brought along was placed around,8863_0.txt
Green's neck and the other end thrown,8863_0.txt
"around the limb of a tree, and in a few",8863_0.txt
moments Green was a corpse. He protested,8863_0.txt
his innocence to the last mo-,8863_0.txt
"apment, and at no time exhibited the",8863_0.txt
least trace of fear except at the expression,8863_0.txt
of a wish on the part of some,8863_0.txt
"of the mob to burn him, and then he",8863_0.txt
"begged them to"" Kill him like a man,""",8863_0.txt
and not to torture him.,8863_0.txt
In explanation of his movements,8863_0.txt
with Luella Mabbit on the night they,8863_0.txt
went away together Green said that,8863_0.txt
he and the girl had planned to elope,8863_0.txt
and had gone from the Mabbit house,8863_0.txt
"to Frankfort, where they separated,",8863_0.txt
Luella going to Indianapolis. while,8863_0.txt
Green went to Kokomo for money and,8863_0.txt
they met in Indianapolis the day following,8863_0.txt
. From there Luella had gone,8863_0.txt
"to Texas, while he had returned home",8863_0.txt
to settle up some affairs preparatory,8863_0.txt
to joining her.,8863_0.txt
In the meantime the people of Walnut,8863_0.txt
Grove are satisfied that Green's,8863_0.txt
"spirit is walking the earth, and that it",8863_0.txt
will never rest until the mystery of,8863_0.txt
Luella Mabbit's fate is effectually,8863_0.txt
cleared up. But he has driven them,8863_0.txt
out of their schoolhouse and forced,8863_0.txt
"the board to build them a new one,",8863_0.txt
and this is undoubtedly the first time,8863_0.txt
in the history of Indiana or any other,8863_0.txt

the avenging fire and the morbid curious,8870_0.txt
relic hunters. A small portion of,8870_0.txt
the trunk and one or two charred bones,8870_0.txt
were recovered and taken to the morgue,8870_0.txt
. Of the hundreds of persons who,8870_0.txt
today visited the spot where the funeral,8870_0.txt
pyre was lighted scarcely one left,8870_0.txt
without some ghastly memento. One,8870_0.txt
man carried away a foot that had not,8870_0.txt
"been consumed. Fragments of clothing,",8870_0.txt
"pieces of wood, cinders and any articles",8870_0.txt
that bore mute testimony of the mob's,8870_0.txt
work were eagerly sought.,8870_0.txt
One arrest was made tonight by State,8870_0.txt
Detective Francis. The prisoner's name,8870_0.txt
"was not divluged by the police, but it",8870_0.txt
is said he is charged with having been,8870_0.txt
a party to the lynching. The police officials,8870_0.txt
have little to say regarding the,8870_0.txt
affair. It is said that state and city,8870_0.txt
detectives were in the crowd last night,8870_0.txt
and recognized some of those who participated,8870_0.txt
"in the burning. Other arrests,",8870_0.txt
"it is believed, will follow.",8870_0.txt
During the show of resistance made,8870_0.txt
by the police and jail officials when,8870_0.txt
the mob attacked the New Castle county,8870_0.txt
"work house, Peter Smith, a 12- year-",8870_0.txt
"old boy, was shot in the back. The",8870_0.txt
bullet which struck him evidently came,8870_0.txt
from a pistol in the crowd and it is,8870_0.txt
claimed by the prison warden that his,8870_0.txt
guards fired over the heads of the,8870_0.txt
lynchers. Smith's condition is critical,8870_0.txt
and he is not expected to live. Another,8870_0.txt
"young man, whose name is unknown,",8870_0.txt
was slightly injured.,8870_0.txt
"Mrs. Bishop, mother of the murdered",8870_0.txt
"girl, is in a state of nervous excitement",8870_0.txt
. White was put to death within,8870_0.txt
a few hundred yards of the Bishop,8870_0.txt
home and the glare of the fire and,8870_0.txt
howls of the mob could be plainly seen,8870_0.txt
and heard at the house.,8870_0.txt
JUDGE EXPLAINS COURT'S POSITION,8870_0.txt
.,8870_0.txt
"Judge Grubb, of the county court, today",8870_0.txt
made a public statement in which,8870_0.txt
he deplores the lynching of White and,8870_0.txt
its consequent reflection upon the good,8870_0.txt
name of Delaware. Judge Grubb also,8870_0.txt
explained the action of the court in refusing,8870_0.txt
to call a special session of the,8870_0.txt
grand jury for the indictment of Miss,8870_0.txt
Bishop's murderer. He says the trial,8870_0.txt
would have been attended by such public,8870_0.txt
clamor and prejudice that a fair,8870_0.txt
"trial would have been impossible, and",8870_0.txt
the court would have been compelled to,8870_0.txt

grant the,8870_0.txt
for a change of venue. Once the prisoner,8870_0.txt
was moved to the insecure jail of,8870_0.txt
"Kent county, or Sussex county, he",8870_0.txt
might have escaped.,8870_0.txt
At the county work house today,8870_0.txt
everything was quiet. Warden Meserve,8870_0.txt
with his guards was on duty and had,8870_0.txt
hundreds of callers to whom they refused,8870_0.txt
admittance. The large double,8870_0.txt

"The leader said his name was Baker,",8870_0.txt

"of Wilmington, although some say he",8870_0.txt

The lynching is believed to have been,8870_0.txt
the result of a plot which was concocted,8870_0.txt
several days ago and was to,8870_0.txt
have been put into execution Saturday,8870_0.txt
"night, but on that occasion there was",8870_0.txt
misunderstanding and the attempt failed,8870_0.txt
The police department was advised,8870_0.txt
during the day of the contemplated attack,8870_0.txt
and thirty policemen in charge of,8870_0.txt
Chief Black and Captains Evans and,8870_0.txt
Kane went to the work house. There,8870_0.txt
were several thousand persons at the,8870_0.txt
prison at that time and the officers,8870_0.txt
were powerless against such large numbers,8870_0.txt
so they entered the building to assist,8870_0.txt
the guards in an effort to protect,8870_0.txt
the prisoner.,8870_0.txt
The leaders of the mob were cool and,8870_0.txt
determined. Warden Meserve told them,8870_0.txt
White was in cell 13 in the third story,8870_0.txt
in order to prevent unnecessary destruction,8870_0.txt
of property. He told the,8870_0.txt
leaders how to disconnect the ceil,8870_0.txt
door.,8870_0.txt
NEGRO FOUGHT FOR LIFE.,8870_0.txt
White fought desperately for his life,8870_0.txt
in the little iron cage cell and knocked,8870_0.txt
down the first man who approached,8870_0.txt
him. The leaders again showed their,8870_0.txt
"clear headedness and one of them, a",8870_0.txt
powerful man stepped forward before,8870_0.txt
anyone could strike the prisoner and,8870_0.txt
threw his arms around the frightened,8870_0.txt
"wretch, thus protecting him from violence",8870_0.txt
. The lawn in front of the prison,8870_0.txt
was a sea of faces when viewed,8870_0.txt
from the porch. White's custodian became,8870_0.txt
convinced that unless strategy,8870_0.txt
was used there would be little chance,8870_0.txt
of getting their man to the spot on,8870_0.txt
"Price's road, where it was planned that",8870_0.txt
the negro should be burned to death.,8870_0.txt
This danger was overcome by a quiet,8870_0.txt
order to extinguish lanterns or keep,8870_0.txt
them concealed. In the darkness there,8870_0.txt
was a confused rush and after this no,8870_0.txt
one seemed to know where the prisoner,8870_0.txt
was.,8870_0.txt
At the stake White's nerve seemed to,8870_0.txt
be good and he held his head up while,8870_0.txt
he addressed the crowd. He made another,8870_0.txt
confession and appealed to God,8870_0.txt
for then,8870_0.txt
mercy rope was,8870_0.txt
. A strong,8870_0.txt
brought and the negro was wrapped,8870_0.txt
in its coils from shoulders to feet. His,8870_0.txt
mouth was working while this was going,8870_0.txt
on and he seemed to be trying to,8870_0.txt
finish his statement. The crowd was in,8870_0.txt
a hurry to get through with its gruesome,8870_0.txt
task and called out for the executioners,8870_0.txt
to hasten. When the rope had,8870_0.txt
been adjusted the negro was fastened,8870_0.txt
to the stake and the torch was applied,8870_0.txt
to the straw.,8870_0.txt
The flames leaped up and licked the,8870_0.txt
man's bare hands. He was held erect,8870_0.txt
by one of the lynchers until his clothing,8870_0.txt
"was burning fairly, when he was",8870_0.txt
pushed into the middle of the fire. He,8870_0.txt
rolled about and his contortions were,8870_0.txt
"terrible, but he made no sound. Suddenly",8870_0.txt
the ropes on his legs parted and,8870_0.txt
he sprang from the fire and started to,8870_0.txt
run. A man struck him in the head,8870_0.txt
with a piece of fence rail and knocked,8870_0.txt
Willing hands threw him,8870_0.txt
him down.,8870_0.txt
again into the flames. He rolled out,8870_0.txt
"several times, but was promptly returned",8870_0.txt

There is an apparent decline from which it would be,8877_0.txt
pleasant to argue the speedy disappearance of this,8877_0.txt
serious offense against law and civilization. There is,8877_0.txt
"a lack of certainty of classification, however, that impairs",8877_0.txt
the usefulness of the statistics. It is not known,8877_0.txt
whether all cases of mob violence are included or only,8877_0.txt
those instances in which mobs have taken culprits,8877_0.txt
from legal custody and inflicted the death penalty,8877_0.txt
The statement is made that not all the illegal executions,8877_0.txt
in the South find their way into print. Suspicion,8877_0.txt
is followed by assassination of negroes in the,8877_0.txt
South with far greater frequency than secures the attention,8877_0.txt
of the newspapers. The infliction of personal,8877_0.txt
"vengeance on that race, which may not be classified as",8877_0.txt
"lynch law, is by no means uncommon, and yet it has",8877_0.txt
the same origin. A negro is suspected of pilfering or,8877_0.txt
"inciting others to crime and is quietly removed,",8877_0.txt
no comment follows. and,8877_0.txt
"Senator Morgan's speech in the Senate, in which",8877_0.txt
he asserts the rights of white civilization as superior,8877_0.txt
to the constitution and to be maintained by forcible,8877_0.txt
suppression of the negro wherever his numbers,8877_0.txt
"threaten white supremacy, tells the whole story.",8877_0.txt
Where the principles of that speech prevail a negro,8877_0.txt
lives only because it does not occur to some one to,8877_0.txt
kill him. As soon as his thrift or his influence makes,8877_0.txt
him formidable to white civilization only his skill,8877_0.txt
at dodging or courage in fighting can save his own life.,8877_0.txt
If the statistics embraced all the cases of enforcement,8877_0.txt
of the principles of the Senator's speech the,8877_0.txt
number of executions would probably be,8877_0.txt

During the past three or four,8881_0.txt
months nearly every important pa,8881_0.txt
per in the country has had some,8881_0.txt
ting to say about lynching. While,8881_0.txt
by far the larger part of the,8881_0.txt
press of all sections is op.,8881_0.txt
"posed to this form of lawlessness,",8881_0.txt
some editors have accomplished the,8881_0.txt
remarkable feat of riding horses,8881_0.txt
going in opposite directions- in one,8881_0.txt
breath both denouncing anarchy and,8881_0.txt
"upholding lynching, forgetting that",8881_0.txt
"they are twin evils, differing not",8881_0.txt
in kind but only in degree. The,8881_0.txt
anarchist wishes to abolish all law,8881_0.txt
while the advocate of lynching would,8881_0.txt
nullify all laws that do not suit his,8881_0.txt
feelings and passions. The two,8881_0.txt
"evils must be eradicated, and law",8881_0.txt

supreme before our civilization will,8881_0.txt

There has been much discussion of,8884_0.txt
lynch law by our State exchanges,8884_0.txt
since the recent lynchings of Luke,8884_0.txt
Hough in this country. In the main,8884_0.txt
the papers have endorsed the summary,8884_0.txt
execution of the brute by the,8884_0.txt
citizens of the McFarland neighborhood,8884_0.txt
", and are almost unanimously",8884_0.txt
opposed to any effort being made to,8884_0.txt

sity of resorting to lynch law is greatly,8884_0.txt
"deplored, but as long as the diabolical",8884_0.txt
crime which provokes it is,8884_0.txt
"committed, it is the unanimous",8884_0.txt
opinion of all the papers that have,8884_0.txt
discussed the matter that there is little,8884_0.txt
hope of putting an end to this,8884_0.txt
form of violence.,8884_0.txt
It is a very serious matter to put a,8884_0.txt
"man to death, brute though he may",8884_0.txt
"be, otherwise than by legal process.",8884_0.txt
So far as the rights of the person who is,8884_0.txt
has committed the nameless crime,8884_0.txt
"are concerned, it matters not how",8884_0.txt
"quick he is put out of the way, or as",8884_0.txt
to the manner of his taking off. It is,8884_0.txt
the effect that mob violence has on,8884_0.txt
society in general that concerns every,8884_0.txt
good citizen. There can be no doubt,8884_0.txt
that lynchings have a demoralizing,8884_0.txt
"effect, though we do not believe, as",8884_0.txt
"do some, that they have a tendency",8884_0.txt
to increase the very crime which,8884_0.txt
usually causes them.,8884_0.txt

the matter? Everybody,8884_0.txt
"agrees that lynchings are bad, but",8884_0.txt

"He was shot at several times by the crowd,",9578_0.txt
which later captured him. There is sonie,9578_0.txt
doubt as to the negro's intentions when he,9578_0.txt
entered the Dooley house. It may only have,9578_0.txt
been for robbery.,9578_0.txt
The recent murder of H. L. Holbrook,9578_0.txt
and his aged wife at their home four miles,9578_0.txt
from here had something to do with the,9578_0.txt
"violence visited upon the prisoners, as",9578_0.txt
four of them were in jail awaiting trial on,9578_0.txt
charges of complicity in the Holbrook,9578_0.txt
"tragedy. The white man, Aycock, was",9578_0.txt
among the number implicated in the killing,9578_0.txt
of the aged couple. Richard Robin-,9578_0.txt
"son, Claude Elder and Lewis Robinson",9578_0.txt
were his alleged companions in the crime.,9578_0.txt
Richard Allen was under sentence of death,9578_0.txt
"for murder, Sandy Price was charged with",9578_0.txt
"attempted assault, Eugene Yerby was",9578_0.txt
charged with burglary and Bob Harris,9578_0.txt
was charged with shooting two negroes.,9578_0.txt
It was about midnight that the mob,9578_0.txt
quietly formed. In perfect order they,9578_0.txt
"marched to the jail, where the jailor was",9578_0.txt
called out and at the point of a number of,9578_0.txt
guns was forced to surrender his keys.,9578_0.txt
"Thus fortified, the crowd had no trouble to",9578_0.txt
get inside the prison. Every cell was,9578_0.txt
opened and the trembling prisoner whieh,9578_0.txt
each contained was ordered out. The,9578_0.txt
nine prisoners in single file were marched,9578_0.txt
to a spot about 200 yards from the jail.,9578_0.txt
On the way to the place of execution Aycock,9578_0.txt
vehemently protested his innocence and,9578_0.txt
begged the mob to spare his life. He was,9578_0.txt
driven forward with the negroes. Most of,9578_0.txt
the blacks went to their death without a,9578_0.txt
word.,9578_0.txt
When the prisoners and their captors,9578_0.txt
had arrived at a spot which seemed best,9578_0.txt
suited to the desire of the mob the nine,9578_0.txt
men were ranged in a row against a fence,9578_0.txt
and each was bound to a post. Then the,9578_0.txt
lynchers lined up and discharged a volley.,9578_0.txt
"Shotguns, pistols and rifles were used by",9578_0.txt
"the lynchers, and their work was quickly",9578_0.txt
done. They dispersed quietly.,9578_0.txt
An examination by the jailer who had,9578_0.txt
been forced by the mob to accompany the,9578_0.txt
party to the scene of the execution showed,9578_0.txt
that eight of the men had been riddled with,9578_0.txt
"bullets and were dead. The ninth, a negro,",9578_0.txt
was found to be only slightly wounded.,9578_0.txt
The post to which he had been bound was,9578_0.txt
torn and splintered by the bullets. He had,9578_0.txt
the presence of mind to fall over as if dead.,9578_0.txt
The rattle of the volley awakened nearly,9578_0.txt
every one in the vicinity and half clad men,9578_0.txt
and women hurriedly left their homes to,9578_0.txt
learn the cause of the firing.,9578_0.txt

"from every corner of the world, stayed the legal massacre of the nine",9664_0.txt
"Scottsboro boys. The hangman's hand has been halted, but it still",9664_0.txt
hankers for its victims. The Supreme Court decision forced by the,9664_0.txt
gigantic and powerful revolutionary movement of millions of toilers,9664_0.txt
throughout the world is a tremendous victory for the entire working class,9664_0.txt
-Negro and white. But it does not yet mean that the fight for the,9664_0.txt
unconditional release of the nine Scottsboro boys is over.,9664_0.txt
The Negro and white masses must be under no illusions. Reliance,9664_0.txt
"on the"" fairness and justice"" of the Alabama lynch courts will only",9664_0.txt
help to tighten the hangman's noose around the necks of the innocent,9664_0.txt
boys- it will not save them. The counter- revolutionary front extending,9664_0.txt
from the imperialist butchers to their servile agents in the,9664_0.txt
ranks of the Negro and white masses- the socialists and Negro reformists,9664_0.txt
- are energetically working to stifle the indignation and wrath of the,9664_0.txt
"masses in their attempts to carry through under cover of"" justice, rights",9664_0.txt
"and equality"" this bloody murder.",9664_0.txt
The lives of the boys have been temporarily wrested from the clutches,9664_0.txt
of the lynchers only by the world- wide mass protests of the toilers. The,9664_0.txt
guarantee for the unconditional release of the Scottsboro boys is not peaceful,9664_0.txt
waiting and watching. It requires a thousandfold intensification,9664_0.txt
"of the mass movement, reaching out to new nooks, mobilizing new sec-",9664_0.txt
"flons of the masses, ever broadening the united front of revolutionary",9664_0.txt
struggle.,9664_0.txt
HE Scottsboro case has helped to crystallize in no undecided manner,9664_0.txt
THE,9664_0.txt
the revolutionary ferment in the ranks of the Negro masses. The,9664_0.txt
"Scottsboro case has proved the efficacy, before the eyes of millions, of",9664_0.txt
revolutionary methods of struggle as against reformist capitulation to,9664_0.txt
the white ruling class. The deepening discontent and political awakening,9664_0.txt
of the Negro toilers has found expression in mass support for the,9664_0.txt
"Scottsboro boys, as a step forward in the entire struggle for Negro",9664_0.txt
liberation. The Scottsboro case has welded strong links in the chain,9664_0.txt
"of unity of white and Negro toilers against the whole vicious, barbarous",9664_0.txt
"system of national oppression, of which this brazen frame- up is but a",9664_0.txt
single expression.,9664_0.txt
But the work cannot rest here. There is danger of a possible slackening,9664_0.txt
down in this mass struggle now that the Supreme Court has,9664_0.txt
rendered its decision. This danger is even greater today than before.,9664_0.txt
"This must be overcome! Decisive measures must be taken NOW, without",9664_0.txt
"a moment's delay, to utilize this recent victory in the struggle for",9664_0.txt
"the Scottsboro boys, to raise to new heights the mass action for their",9664_0.txt
complete freedom. We must completely wipe out the tendency to limit,9664_0.txt
the struggle only to the forces already in and around the International,9664_0.txt
Labor Defense and the revolutionary mass organizations. New masses,9664_0.txt
must be drawn into the movement.,9664_0.txt
This important partial victory in the battle for the complete release,9664_0.txt
of the Negro lads offers a splendid opportunity through which to penetrate,9664_0.txt
even the most backward sections of the masses of Negro and white,9664_0.txt
toilers those masses who have never before been stirred to action. We,9664_0.txt
must develop in the ranks of the widest sections of the oppressed toilers,9664_0.txt
"the consciousness and determination that they, themselves, on their own",9664_0.txt
"initiative, must widen the base of the movement, in the neighborhoods,",9664_0.txt
"in the factories, in the ranks of the unemployed, in the reformist organizations",9664_0.txt
. Everywhere to develop such forms of organization as will,9664_0.txt
rally the broadest sections of the white and Negro masses in working,9664_0.txt
"class solidarity, to defeat the united forces of reaction in their attempts",9664_0.txt
to murder the boys.,9664_0.txt
The united front Scottsboro conference in every locality must take,9664_0.txt
on new life and vitality. Where such conferences have gone out of existence,9664_0.txt
they should be immediately revived and begin to function not in,9664_0.txt
"a narrow circle- but reaching out to new elements, particularly penetrating",9664_0.txt
the Negro reformist organizations and A. F. of L. unions. Through,9664_0.txt
the building up of the Scottsboro Defense Committee in the neighborhoods,9664_0.txt
", factories, schools, new adherents can be won for the defense of",9664_0.txt
the Scottsboro boys.,9664_0.txt
THE further struggle for the release of the Scottsboro boys must be,9664_0.txt
concretely linked up with the struggle against the whole system of,9664_0.txt
"mob violence and lynch terror. The workers, and especially the white",9664_0.txt
"workers, must react with more decisiveness and determination to every",9664_0.txt
"act of discrimination, every act of repression of Negro toiler sand connect",9664_0.txt
this struggle with the Scottsboro case.,9664_0.txt
Major attention must be given to penetrating the South in the,9664_0.txt
struggle for the Scottsboro boys. The decision of the Supreme Court,9664_0.txt
hands the boys back to the same lynchers and slave drivers who condemned,9664_0.txt
"them to death. It is therefore right here, above all, where",9664_0.txt
"the national oppression of the Negro people takes on the sharpest forms,",9664_0.txt
that the vigilence of the Negro and white toilers must be aroused to prevent,9664_0.txt
the perpetration of this lynching. The base exists in the rapidly,9664_0.txt
developing mass struggles for unemployment relief and against the terror,9664_0.txt

happened this week- one minus the sickening horror,9744_0.txt
attached to burning at the stake. Perhaps this,9744_0.txt
was because the victim was a white man. Two or,9744_0.txt

"significant- the lustful mania has developed, or has",9744_0.txt

Queenstown in the early sixties for,9761_1.txt

The man was simply taken by infuriated,9761_1.txt
"people and hanged on a hickory tree, on",9761_1.txt
"the farm of Robert J. Wilson, near",9761_1.txt
Queenstown. The second case was that,9761_1.txt
"of James Pippin, a white man, who was",9761_1.txt
the leader of a gang of robbers infesting,9761_1.txt
the neighborhood of Church Hill during,9761_1.txt

"Monday, after the sentence of imprisonment",9761_2.txt

seriously interfered with except the,9761_2.txt

body of masked men shortly after 1,9761_2.txt
o'clock this morning and hanged on a,9761_2.txt
bearing peach tree. It had been threat-,9761_2.txt
ened before sentence was passed that in,9761_2.txt
case the penalty was anything less than,9761_2.txt

Sheriff T. Frank Seward made a strong,9761_2.txt
effort to keep the mob back but several,9761_2.txt
",",9761_2.txt
of them just caught him bodily and pinned,9761_2.txt
him to the floor and took the keys,9761_2.txt
from his pocket. He was then forced,9761_2.txt
back to the end of the hall with guns,9761_2.txt
pointed in his face.,9761_2.txt
THE PRISON INTERIOR.,9761_2.txt
"Sheriff Turner coming down stairs,",9761_2.txt
was confronted by a rifle and shot gun.,9761_2.txt
He was told to come no further on pain,9761_2.txt
"of death, and he had to go back. The",9761_2.txt
mob then opened the doors leading to,9761_2.txt
the cell where the prisoner Asbury Green,9761_2.txt

"to the right of this, in the north end of",9761_2.txt
"the building, are four cells two on each",9761_2.txt
side of a narrow passage. Geen was in,9761_2.txt
"the first cell, an iron bound one on the",9761_2.txt
east side. A large door had to be unlocked,9761_2.txt
in order to get into the passage,9761_2.txt
where the cells were situated. It was a,9761_2.txt
difficult lock to open. A number of the,9761_2.txt
lynchers crowded into the,9761_2.txt
passage.,9761_2.txt
"When Green's door was reached, it was",9761_2.txt
but a moment's work to open it with the,9761_2.txt
keys.,9761_2.txt
DRAGGED TO DEATH.,9761_2.txt
The prisoner was dragged from his,9761_2.txt
cell by a rope around his neck- literally,9761_2.txt
"dragged though office and hall, porch",9761_2.txt
"and gate, out to the street corner, where",9761_2.txt
"some of the lynchers mounted horses,",9761_2.txt
which seemed to be in readiness. The,9761_2.txt
crowd then hurried down in the direction,9761_2.txt
of the wharf. Green seemed to,9761_2.txt
"know his fate at once, and during the",9761_2.txt
"temporary halt begged piteously, but it",9761_2.txt
availed nothing. When he was first,9761_2.txt
taken from his cell he had also begged,9761_2.txt
"for mercy, but no attention was paid to",9761_2.txt
the appeal. Outside the jail he was,9761_2.txt
hurried down the street known as Broad,9761_2.txt
way in the direction of the wharf. Several,9761_2.txt
pistols or guns were fired as the crowd,9761_2.txt
passed down. There was but little talk.,9761_2.txt
ing or swearing but some yelling on the,9761_2.txt
way. The prisoner was dragged by the,9761_2.txt

made into the peach orchard of ex Sheriff,9761_2.txt
R. Hooper Smith. About twenty- four,9761_2.txt
strides from the turning in point the rope,9761_2.txt
was thrown over the limb of a peach,9761_2.txt
"tree and the body was drawn up, leaving",9761_2.txt
the victim's feet about eight inches from,9761_2.txt
the ground. The corpse was seen at daylight,9761_2.txt
. The trail of the body dragged,9761_2.txt
along the route was plainly shown on the,9761_2.txt
ground all the way from the jail. The,9761_2.txt
body had been evidently rushed in a,9761_2.txt

The prison offlcers were overpowered,9761_2.txt

were made. When Green was reached,9761_2.txt
in his cell he was asleep. He had no,9761_2.txt
clothing on but under shirt and drawers.,9761_2.txt
These were pretty well dragged from,9761_2.txt
him by the time he got to the peach tree,9761_2.txt
"perhaps, indeed, life was extinct before",9761_2.txt
he reached that destination. The rope,9761_2.txt
used was an ordinary hemp rope of three,9761_2.txt
strands and about eight feet long. The,9761_2.txt
cord was thrown over a limb and carried,9761_2.txt
down and tied to the body of the tree. In,9761_2.txt

by a crowd of young farmers bent on,9772_0.txt
deadly vengeance. The alarm was given,9772_0.txt

"from prison at Granditas, where",9772_1.txt
he had served a term for homicide.,9772_1.txt
The matter will be investigated. One,9772_1.txt
theory is that Toscano was drunk and,9772_1.txt
another that he deliberately planned,9772_1.txt
to shoot the chief magistrate. The,9772_1.txt

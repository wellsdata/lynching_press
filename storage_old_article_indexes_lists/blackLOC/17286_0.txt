land- grabbing band of night- rid
ers, the Klan grew to become
something above the law when it
came to dealing with Negroes. As
the propagators and defenders of
lynch- law, the Klan has covered
the history of America with shame.
Overwhelmed by the wrath and
indignation of decent Americans,
the was some
ago, and many of its members were
called to account before the law
which they had openly flouted.
Following a long period during
which it dared not operate, openly,
the Ku Klux Klan has come alive
again, and apparently expects to
find Negroes everywhere just waiting
to be frightened and lynched
to death. However, there have
been some changes made in the
interval between the hey- day of
the terrorist and the present resurgence
. Negroes have learned
to defend themselves against lawless
attacks, and the nation has
learned much from the second world
slaughter now drawing to a close.
It was a racial doctrine similar
to that of the Klan's that was responsible
for World War Two, and
the Nazi mobsters who destroyed
and crucified acted in much the
same manner as the Klansmen do.
It has been reported that the
Klan originally adopted the white
sheet regalia because it made the
members look like ghosts, and Negroes
were supposed to be afraid
of ghosts. That may or may not
have been true back in the days
when superstition gripped America
so strongly the good citizens of
New England were not above executing
a woman because she was
suspected of being a witch, but
this is a new
Negroes are not afraid of the
most superior Caucasian on a man
to man basis, and they are in an
improved position to do something
effective about superior Caucasian
mobs that come looking for trouble.
Heretofore, as I pointed out in
another column, the price a law
less mob has had to pay for attacking
Negroes has been negli-
gible, and consequently, there has
not been too much hesitancy on
the part of these gangsters to liven
up a dull evening by kicking up
merry hell in the Negro section.
However, those are no longer the
conditions that prevail.
The law is stronger in the sec-
tions formerly_dominated by the
Klan, and the Federal government
is prepared to take over should
the community guardians fail to
do their duty. Negroes everywhere
are learning that it is no more
painful to die fighting back against
an unjust and unwarranted attack
than it is to stand still and take
it without a defense. There may
or may not be some disturbed moments
in American racial history,
according to the limits to which
the Klan is prepared to go, but
one thing is certain, there will be
a few white sheets messed up if
the program is to terrorize the
Negro.
Dr. Green is reportedly quite
proud to be the head of what he
calls a one hundred per cent American
organization, and he must expect
that Negro Americans will
be waiting to match his Ameri-
canism in any way he selects

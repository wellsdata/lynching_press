There seems to be little doubt but that
the Negro lynched in the penitentiary of
Wyoming Wyoming by by the the convicts convicts was was a a moral moral de de
generate, providing he was guilty of even
half of what he was accused, but just how
fifty or more convicts could break from
their line of march and lynch a man and
yet the guards not know the guilty ones,
is more than even a jackass with a head
almost a yard long can explain. The whole
story reads like it was aided and abetted
by the prison officials, and if they did not
then it is an easy matter for the warden
to get the names of every convict that participated
in the act. Lynch law is a relic
of barbarism and under its baleful influence
the whole country is slowly but surely ret
rograding rograding.. Human monsters that will rob
a woman of her virtue are too despicable
to be permitted to associate with the hu
man family and death should be their por.
tion, and this is especially true of a human
monster that will attack a saintly matron
of seventy summers, but death is but death,
and the penalty is no more severe when
administered by a mob than by law. That
the warden and many of the guards were
fully aware of the lynching bee is quite
apparent. It's now up to the governor of
the state to remove the entire official roster
the penitentiary in order to protect the
good of name of the state.
LAW. THE BY LYNCHED

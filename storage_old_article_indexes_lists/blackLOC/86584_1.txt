LYNCHING MADE EASY.
Is there such a thing as government
in the State of Kentucky
? The liesurely perfor
[ mance of a Paducah mob in tak
ing one Negro from the County
Jail and lynching him and another
without serious interference
by the authorities gives point to
the question. The jail doors had

had to be forced, necessitating
further delay until a foundryman
could be summond to cut the
bars. Altogether, five hours of
precious time from the point of
view of men bent on vengeance
were consumed before the mob
gained possession of its victims
and could proceed to hang and
burn them.
There was plenty of time for
mob violence, plenty of time for
lawlessness. Why was the time
not sufficient also for the authorities
to act, for the sheriff to raise
a posse, or to appeal for mititary
aid? Their utter failure to pre
vent the lynching in the circumstances
puts the stamp of official
incompetency, if not of official
cowardice, on the Paducah authorities
. If there are degrees
of disgrace in lynchings, the
Kentucky city must bear the reproach
of having permitted one
of the exhibitions of unrestrained
worst mob violence.

proclaimed were
the
and Negroes
worse sufferers even though
thousands of white men lost
their vote also.
These same Lilly- White sup
porters are attacking Judge Ira
Hobinson stating that he is a
relative of Fred O. Blue and will
retain him in office as prohibition
commissioner. If our memory
serves us rightly the Tax
Commissioner is appointed for a
term of six years. Mr. Blue
was
appointed by Governor
Glasscock and has some time yet
to serve. The
next
governor,
whoever he may be, will not have
the ar pointment of a prohibition
commissioner. Lilly of all men
should not discuss, or want dis
cassed by his supporters the
question of relationship.
Beware voters of placing in
thice any man who believes in
the lax inforcement of the law.
The governor, prohibition officer
or any other public official who
says he will wink at certain vic
lations of the law is a dangerous
man because he is able to wink
at a mob seeking to lynch you or
your fellow man.
This paper was wet when the
state was wet and we are wet
now but every man with a thimble
full of sense knows that the
liquor question has no place in
this campaign because neither
the governor nor the legislature
can legally make West Virginia
wet and the people will not.
The people are being deceived
and the deceivers will reap the
punishment they deserve-
1 ominous defeat. ig

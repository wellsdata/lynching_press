Hemphill, Texas, June 22.- Eleven
Negroes have been lynched and three
white men killed in a race war in
Sabine county, the State Rangers ordered
out to restore peace, armed
bands of whites and blacks are facing
each other in several places, and several
encounters have been reported
tonight.
A mob stormed the jail here last
night, seized six Negroes accused of
the murder of a white farmer, hang
ed five to one limb and shot the sixth
when the noose broke and he was
running away. The bodies of three
other Negroes were found riddled
with bullets this morning. Two others
were shot to death last night.
Three were hanged tonight near San
Augustine.
Another, arrested with a white man
whom he accused of hiring him to
slay Robert Wright, is in jail at Center
, having been rushed there under
guard to save them from the
extra mob.
Rangers Pushed Aside.
State Rangers Lattie and Hamer,
stationed at Center, went to Hemphill
when the first news of the trouble
reached them. They attempted to take
a hand. The county officers found
aside. The county officers found
themselves similarly served when they
tried to uphold the law and, unable
to dominate the situation, they wired
for reinforcements.
The sheriff at Hemphill made an
effort to swear in special officers,

to swear in fled at his approach, fear-
ing that they would be cheated of
their revenge.
The frenzied hatred against the
Negroes came as the result of the
shooting of a white mar by Negroes
a week ago. At a Negro dance on
June 13 William Stimson, a white
man, became involved in a row with
the Negroes and was killed with a razor
. Two Negroes were arrested for
the crime.
Last Saturday night Hugh Dean,
one of the best- known white farmers,
was also killed at a Negro dance. It
was proved that he was merely riding
by when drunken Negroes set upon
him and stabbed him to death.
Six Negroes were arrested and imprisoned
in the Hemphill jail. A seventh
is still at large and a reward of
$ 550 is out for him.
Negroes and Whites Arm.
The passion stirred up by the kill
ing of Stimson and Dean within a
week was increased by the fact that
Negroes grew bold and began to
flourish weapons. Six- shooters were
prominent and open threats made of
what would be done in the event that
the white men showed any open animosity
toward the Negro.
The farmers of the vicinity armed
themselves with rifles and shotguns
and pistols and started on a systematic
hunt after every Negro of known bad
tendencies.
The county peace officers found
they were powerless to cope with the
situation.
Hurried appeals were made to the
Governor, and a squad of Rangers
was ordered immediately to the
scene.

Negroes were known to be partners
of a fourth. The latter, Perry Price,
would surely have met the same fate
of his fellows had not officers cap-
tured and spirited him to San Au-
gustine after making a confession that
he had been given five dollars by
Robert Wright, Johnson's brother- in-
law, to kill Johnson. Wright was
then arrested and is now in jail at
Center, Tex.
The jail is guarded heavily, as the
rumor has gone abroad that a mob
of white men has captured a Houston
east and west train and is forcing
the engineer to run to center in order
that they may take Wright and
Price and hang them.
Break Into Jail.
Last night the white men marched
to the Hemphill jail.
" We want those Negroes," said the
spokesman.
" You can't have them," replied the
guard.
" Well, by G-, we will take them,"
was the answer.
With a savage cry the mob attack
ed the doors. Other guards rushed
out, but were overpowered after mak-
ing futile resistance.
Into the jail the mob broke, and,
rushing to the cell in which the six
Negroes were confinjed, they smash-
ed the door and seized the blacks.
One hundred yards from the jail
grows a clump of huge live- oaks. As
they reached these the leader spoke
again.
" Niggers, say your prayers."
Seven minutes were allowed, and
seven ropes descended over the Negroes
' heads, one after another. One
broke and ran. Immediately a fusil-
lade of lead followed him, and he
dropped in his tracks. Meantime the
noose had been placed on the heads
of the others and Judge Lynch

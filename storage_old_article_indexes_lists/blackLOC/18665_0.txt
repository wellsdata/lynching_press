YORK. The National Asso
Niation for the Advancement of
Colored People makes public the re
ply of Governor Hugh M. Dorsey of
Georgia, to two telegrams concern
ing specific cases of lynching in Georgia
, in which the Association asked
Governor Dorsey what it could" tell
America concerning Georgia's co- operation
with the president in helping
to stamp out mob violence."
The first telegram( August 21st),
referred to a memornadum submitted
to Governor Dorsey, in person, by the
Assistant Secretary of the Association
, July 10, in which were given the
names of seventeen members of the
mob which lynched Negroes in Brooks
and Lowndes counties from May 17
to May 22, at which time the governor
stated in the most positive terms that
he would do all in his power to bring
the guilty parties to justice. The
second telegram( August 26), urged
Governor Dorsey to use every power
at his command to apprehend the
lynchers of Ike Radney, who was
lynched near Colquit, Georgia, on Au
gust 11.
Governor Dorsey's reply addressed
to John R. Shillady, secretary of the
Association, makes no reference to the
case of Radney, and is given below.
In a statement issued last night, Mr.
Shillady says that lynchings have occurred
in Texas. Louisiana and Georgia
since the president's denunciation
of lynching and mob violence was
made, and in each case the Association
addressed inquiries to the governors
of the three states. No ac
knowledgements have been received
from Texas and Louisiana, and de
spite diligent inquiries the Association
has been unable to ascertain that any
steps at all have been taken to apprehend
the lynchers. So far as the
governors of these three states are
concerned, President Wilson's proclamation
has had no effect, and is apparently
wholly disregarded.
Governor Dorsey's letter to Mr. Shil
lady follows:
Dear Sir:
Referring to your telegram of Au
gust 21 and 22( 26th), with refer
ence to the recent lynchings in Brooks
and Lowndes counties:
" So far as I am able to ascertain
no definite results have been obtained
in the effort to apprehend the guilty
parties.
" I shall take pleasure in advising
you in the event any
take place. developments

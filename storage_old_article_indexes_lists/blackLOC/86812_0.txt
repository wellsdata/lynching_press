HICAGO, III., July 30.- Emanating
from the Bourbon south the home
,
of mob rule and lynch law and the
mother of the Klu Klux Klan there
has come in the last few months a
distinct propaganda which has as its
design the inciting of race animosity,
discrediting the Negro soldiers and
bringing the record of the fairer north
and west down to the level of its own.
A deliberate, organized attempt has
been made and is still being made, to
inflame the passions of men and incite
to deeds of violence. The nation's
capital has disgraced herself
and now America's greatest cosmopolitan
city follows as the next city
to reap the results of this propaganda.
Sunday afternoon, July 27, was a
sweltering hot day. Thousands of Chi
caogans were seeking relief in the cool
waters of Lake Michigan when a white
hoodlum seeing a Colored lad paddling
out into the lake picked up a
large stone and hurled it at the youth.
It knocked him into the water and he
drowned before assistance could reach
him. Onlookers immediately called
the attention of a white police officer
to this fact and asked that the
thrower of the stone, Augusta Straub-
er, be arrested. This the officer refused
to do. His refusal angered the
crowd, and they immediately began
to clean up the beach, hurrying to
their homes they returned with weapons
of all sorts. A mellee followed,
at the end of which hundreds of whites
lay wounded. Meanwhile Strauber
was arrested by two Colored detect
ives, Middleton and Scott.
News of the Outbreak Spreads All
Over the City.
Every section of the city heard the
news; it spread like wildfire. All up
State street on nearly every corner
thousands gathered in tense groups
and talked in low tones over the situation
. Sunday night and Monday
morning early there were nearly two
dozen different fights in which over
two hundred people were injured, the
majority of whom were white, scores
of police officers when they showed
a tendency to administer justice too
filled with prejudice payed the penalty
of their zeal. Hundreds of police
reserves and four hundred mounted
policemen were called out Sunday to
quell the riot. They rendered most
effective service and were most successful
in putting down disorder when
they showed no discrimination, but
set themselves to the task of riding
down, shooting into and arresting
white offenders as well as Colored.
Chief of Police Garriety, Alcock, his
assistant, Mayor Thompson and leading
organzations of both races are
working zealously to restore the peace,
while 4,000 soldiers of both races are
held in reserve in the armories. The
officials are confident they can handle
the situation without military assistance
.
The governor, who was en route to
Nebraska, turned back at Burlington
and hastened toward Chicago.
The police list of riot fatalities rose
to 25 at 10:30 p. m., when Thomas
Joshua, Negro, was killed by a detective
, who fired into a crowd of rioters
on the South Side, and when B. F.
Hardy, a Negro died at a hospital.

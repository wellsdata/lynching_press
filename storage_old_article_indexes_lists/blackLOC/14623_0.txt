A BLOW AT LYNCHING.
This paper has condemned the South for tolerance
of lynching; it now congratulates North
Carolina on the conviction and imprisonment of
15 members of a lynching party. They tried
to break into the jail at Winston- Salem to seize
a Negro.
It took moral courage to find a verdict of guilty
, for the man whom the mob sought to lynch
had committed a crime which drives Southern
ers into a frenzy. The jury might be exposed
to the charge that they were lacking in chivalry.
They might have palliated acquittal by pointing
out that the mob had failed. They might have
compromised by convicting one or two of the
leaders and letting the rest go.
The things that made it hard for the jury to
convict also made it hard for the judge to sentence
. But the court did its duty: sentences
ranging from 14 months to six years were im
posed.
Perception is beginning to dawn that lynching
is anarchy and lynchers as much a menace to the
Government as the men who opposed conscription
.
The conviction of these men in Winston- Salem
is encouraging. It would be more encouraging
if the case were reported from Georgia instead
of North Carolina. The record of North Carolina
in the matter of lynchings is better
that of most Southern states.- Pittsburgh Post than.

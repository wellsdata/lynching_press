Operation Action
The eyes of the Negro people are on the Congress of
the United States. The reason is that their vote was responsible
for the nation- wide housecleaning that gave the
Democrats their victory.
The Democratic Party, to whose platform all Democrats
in Congress are committed, promised to guarantee by
legislation of the 81st Congress:
( 1) The right of full and equal political participation
by abolition of the poll tax and all other barriers to
voting.
( 2) The right to equal opportunity of employment, by
passage of a federal FEPC.
( 3) The right of security of person, by passage of the
anti lynch'ng bill and the strengthening of the
civil rights statutes.
( 4) The right of equal treatment in the service and defense
of our nation, by the abolit on of all discrimination
and segregation in the armed forces.
That program won the election. We expect the Democrats
to live up to these promises or they may never
get such an opportunity agin within our time.
Crimes against the Negro people such as lynchings and
terrorist killing must be stopped. Today our Government
is powerless either to prevent lynching or to enforce justice
against lynchers. The power is in the hands of the states.
Lynching can only be stopped by legislation directed
against the lynchers, making participation in an act of
violence against citizens because of race or color a federal
crime punishable by heavy sentence. This legislation
derives its novel power of direct sanction against individ
als from Article 55 of the United Nations charter and
from the historic inability of states alone to act.
The men and women who have pledged to do some
thing about helping to elevate the Negro to first class
itizenship must act now not only to save the face of the
New Democratic Party of Harry Truman but the face of
the United States of America that is now striving political
and, social leadership of the world. for

NEGRO HATER DEFENDANT
AGAIN IN DIVORCE SUIT
Claude Nethaway, whose second
trial for leading a mob which lynched
a Negro at the court house is pending,
is now defendant in a divorce suit, all
over his continual talk about" nigger
lovers."
His second wife, who is now seek
ing divorce, says Nethaway is nutty
about the" Negro question" and makes
her life miserable. It has been suggested
that Mrs. Nethaway is using
good judgment. It has also been suggested
by a lot of people that Netha
way's first wife would have used good
judgment had she taken similar ac
tion.
As a general proposition those in
touch with all the Nethaway business
were never very well satisfied about
the manner in which the trial of Mrs.
Nethaway's slayer ended. Nethaway
himself has lost considerable respect
of former friends and his latest es
tends to enhance that condition
apade.

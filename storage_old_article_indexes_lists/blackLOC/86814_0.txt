by Anything in the Annals
of Savagery.
TEW YORK.- The National Asso
NEW
ciation for the Advancement of
Colored People, through its secretary,
John R. Shillady, announces that the
names of two ring- leaders and fifteen
other participants in one of the mobs
which lynched the first two of the
eleven victims of the five days lynch
ing orgy, which took place in Brooks
and Lowndes counties, Georgia, from
May 17 to May 22, were put before
Governor Hugh M. Dorsey of Georgia,
in person by Walter F. White, assist
ant secretary of the association, who
spent four days in South Georgia investigating
the affair. A full report
of Mr. White's findings, which were
of a sensational character, were at
the same time placed before Governor
Dorsey. The summary of the association's
report which follows below
states that eleven authenticated cases
of lynching instead of six as reported
in the press at the time, were discovered
by their investigator. The re
port describes the lynching of Mary
Turner, the wife of one of the first
victims, which was most revolting and
brutal. The eleven persons lynched
met their fate as the result of mob
frenzy, following the killing of Hampton
Smith, a white farmer, and the
wounding of his wife, on May 16. One
of the men lynched is said by the association
to have stated to several
persons interviewed by Mr. White,
that he alone did the shooting and
that no others were implicated.
Mr.
The association says that
White's findings were submitted to
Governor Dorsey at the latter's request
on July 10 and that a copy
was mailed the president for his in-
formation a few days ago.
In making public the results of the
assistant secretary's investigations
into the South Georgia lynchings, Mr.
Shillady, the secretary said that the
association was gratified beyond
measure at the recent magnificent
pronouncement of President Wilson in
condemnation of the mob spirit and
lynching.
" The association appreciates," said
Mr. Shillady," as perhaps no other
organization in the country can, the
full meaning of the danger which
President Wilson seeks to avoid when
he calls upon the governors of all the
states, the law officers of every community
, and above all, the men and
women of every community in the
United States**
to make a
end to this disgraceful evil."
" The lynching of Negroes," said
Mr. Shillady," has become so much
a habit in certain sections of our
country that the president's prestige
was needed to give impetus to the
movement to overcome it. Governor
Dorsey, who in his message to the
Georgia legislature on July 3 denounced
mdo violence in strong terms
,
and the state of Georgia are now
challenged to measure to Presi-
up
dent Wilson's great appeai. In one
memorable sentence President Wilson
has put it squarely up to each community
. As the president says," it
( lynching and mob violence) cannot
live where the community does not
countenance it.'"
A summary of the report follows:
" Instead of six victims of the mob
which ranged over Brooks and
Lowndes counties from May 17 to
May 22, eleven authenticated cases
were discovered during an investigation
of the circumstances surrounding
the killing of Hampton Smith, a
white farmer of Brooks couonty, Ga.,
and the wounding of his wife near
Barney, Ga., on May 16, and of the
lynchings which followed. Press dispatches
at the time named Will
Head, Will Thompson, Hayes Turner
, Mary Turner, his wife; Eugene
Rice and Sidney Johnson, the latter
of whom had stated before he was
captured to several inter-
persons
viewed that he alone was implicated
in the affair and that the five who
had previously been lynched( the five
already named) were not involved
it. Five additional victims were in
found, Chime Riley, Simon Schuman,
and three unidentified Negroes whose
bodies were taken from the Little
river just below Quitman, Ga., about
a week after they had been lynched.
Negroes of the neighborhood told the
investigator that there were eighteen
victims, but no more than eleven could
be authenticated.
" More than 500 Negroes have left
the region since the outbreak so that
a number of Negroes who were said
by acquaintances to have mysterious
ly disappeared could not be located
nor their whereabouts ascertained
and are not included in the investigator's
findings. Hundreds of acres
of once productive lands. are now
overrun with weeds and dozens of
farm houses and cabins deserted by
their former occupants despite the
threats involved in the statements
of the mobs that any Negro attempt
ing to leave the region would be considered
to be involved in the killing
of Smith.
" Chime Riley was lynched and clay
turpentine cups, used to catch the
gum when turpentine trees are cut,
was tied to his body and the body
thrown into the Little river, near
Barney, Ga. Simon Schuman was
called out of his house near Berlin,
Ga., on the Moultrie road, at night
and has not been seen since. The interior
of his house, as well as the furniture
, was completely demolished.
" The story of Mary Turner's fate
was related to the investigator by
men who affirmed that they were
present at her death and is related
with every desire to avoid the gruesome
except as is necessary in giv
ing the facts.
" Mary Turner, wife of Hayes Tur
ner, who had been reported by the
press as having been lynched be
cause of' unwise remarks' concerning
the lynching of her husband and who
was approaching confinement, was
tied by the ankles and hung head
downward. Gasoline was taken from
the automobiles of the lynching party
and poured on her clothing which was
then burned from her person. After
her clothes had burned off she was.
disembowled and her unborn child fell
from her womb and while still alive,
was crushed by the heel of a member
of the mob. The woman's body was
riddled with bullets from high- pow-
ered rifles until it was unrecognizable
. She was buried ten feet from
the tree and at head of her grave
was placed a whisky bottle with a
cigar stump in the neck of it. A
photograph of the grave as described
is in the possession of the Association
for the Advancement of
People." Colored

KID-LYNCHERS: FEDERAL ACTION NEEDED,bp346.txt

By ALBERT,bp346.txt
(Reprinted,bp346.txt
DEUTSCH,bp346.txt
from PM)DEUTSCH,bp346.txt
The unspeakable act perpetrated on a Mississippi bridge Monday,bp346.txt
should bring the sting of shame to every decent American. When a,bp346.txt
"race-mad mob of morons 'lynches a couple of 14-year-old kids, one",bp346.txt
begins to wonder if even a colored infant in its crib is immune from,bp346.txt
the perverted wrath of such sorry speciments of homo sapiens.,bp346.txt
The news dispatch follows the well-grooved pattern of lynching,bp346.txt
stories we have come to expect from the benighted area which boasts,bp346.txt
a John E. Rankin as one of its representatives in Congress:,bp346.txt
"The two boys, charged with the attempted rape of a 13-year-old",bp346.txt
"white girl, were taken from jail by a mob of “unidentified men,” who",bp346.txt
"""overpowered"" the ""surprised"" city marshal after he answered a knock",bp346.txt
on the door.,bp346.txt
The dispatch tells us that'City Marshal Debbs was guarding the.,bp346.txt
"jall alone when it was stormed by the mob. It adds, significantly, that",bp346.txt
six lynchings had previously occurred at the same bridge where the,bp346.txt
two boys were hanged.,bp346.txt
It is hard to believe that the marshal was greatly surprised by,bp346.txt
the visit of his lynch-bent visitors. It is hard to believe that ade-,bp346.txt
quate protection couldn't have been given the two boys if the police,bp346.txt
authorities had wished sincerely to see justice done.,bp346.txt
The whole affair is a stench to the nostrils of every law-abid-,bp346.txt
ing citizen with a sense of fair play. Lynching is execrable under,bp346.txt
any circumstance. But when a mob deliberately draws a pair of,bp346.txt
"14-year-olds from jail for a lynching dee, it hits an abysmal low",bp346.txt
in human conduct.,bp346.txt
Lynch-rule can't be localized. A civilized nation can't tolerate it,bp346.txt
anywhere within its border. In this great war crisis it becomes not,bp346.txt
"only a humanitarian, but a political and military problem.",bp346.txt
Every lyncher in that party deserves a personal presentation,bp346.txt
of the Iron Cross from Herr Hitler himself. He deserves honorary,bp346.txt
"membership in Der Fuehrer's Black Corps, for he has done more",bp346.txt
for the Nazi cause than a battalion of stormtroopers.,bp346.txt
We may be sure that the Gobbels propaganda mill is already broad-,bp346.txt
casting the incident to every corner of the world. The Nazis have,bp346.txt
always exploited lynching in America as a major propaganda weapon,bp346.txt
"against us. When our scholars tear apart the Nazi race myth, the",bp346.txt
Hitlerites point to our own lynching record. When we express horror,bp346.txt
"at Nazi atrocities, they throw back the taunt, ""Look who's talking!""",bp346.txt
Every detail of every lynching is broadcast by the Nazi radio,bp346.txt
"stations to the colored peoples of the world, who represent the majority |",bp346.txt
of the human population and include some of our most valuable allies.,bp346.txt
We'd only be kidding ourselves if we brushed off this type of propa-,bp346.txt
ganda as ineffective.,bp346.txt
The Mississippi child-lynching shows once more that Federal,bp346.txt
action is needed to blot out this curse. It is high time to reviva,bp346.txt

custody from mob violence. It also holds localities liable to civil suits,bp346.txt
in Federal courts for lynchings within their borders.,bp346.txt
Every lyncher should be vigorously sought out and punished as,bp346.txt

TEXARKANA,bp350.txt
Dear Editor: I am a soldier in,bp350.txt
the United States Army. In my,bp350.txt
traveling it was necessary to get,bp350.txt
"of the troop train in Texarkana,",bp350.txt
Texas. Before leaving the train,bp350.txt
many of us Negro soldiers reviewed,bp350.txt
"the case of Willie Vinson, a Negro",bp350.txt
who was lynched by a mob of,bp350.txt
"hoodlums"" in this city last month.",bp350.txt
"Vinson, as the story goes, was ac-",bp350.txt
cused of attacking a white woman.,bp350.txt
and while awaiting trial Vinson,bp350.txt
was lynched by men who are free,bp350.txt
in Texarkana today.,bp350.txt
While at our home camp many,bp350.txt
of us soldiers had been furious to,bp350.txt
read the accounts of this crime in,bp350.txt
Texarkana. We wondered why the,bp350.txt
laws of America were not upheld,bp350.txt
in punishing these brutal killers in,bp350.txt
Texarkana.,bp350.txt
One of my fellow soldiers wrote,bp350.txt
a personal letter to the mayor of,bp350.txt
Texarkana and asked why the city,bp350.txt
officials were not doing their all for,bp350.txt
the sake of. justice. The writer,bp350.txt
pointed out that in these troubled,bp350.txt
days the life of every man-white,bp350.txt
or black-should be preserved for,bp350.txt
"the defense of America. But no,",bp350.txt
Texarkansans would rather kill,bp350.txt
than preserve.,bp350.txt
In answer to my friend's request,bp350.txt
the honorable mayor of Texarkana,bp350.txt
stated that the good citizens of his,bp350.txt
city must be protected. He made it,bp350.txt
known that there are two sets of,bp350.txt
"laws which govern Texas. First, the",bp350.txt
"law of the state, which protects its",bp350.txt
"citizens; second, the law of the mob.",bp350.txt
which sees that men are punished.,bp350.txt
I wondered as my train stopped,bp350.txt
In the city of Texarkana. Would the,bp350.txt
law of the state welcome us? Would,bp350.txt
the rule of the mob hang us?,bp350.txt
"Thus, as my feet touched the soll",bp350.txt
of that God-forsaken city. a feeling,bp350.txt
of hate and horror overcame me.,bp350.txt
I felt like one cast into the lions',bp350.txt
"den, waiting and watching anxious-",bp350.txt

"And then a voice said, ""Ye have",bp350.txt

"thine enemy. But I say unto you,",bp350.txt
"love your enemies, bless them that",bp350.txt
"curse you, do good to them that",bp350.txt
"hate you, and pray for them which",bp350.txt
despitefully use you and persecute,bp350.txt
"you.""",bp350.txt
A warm smile came to my lips,bp350.txt

with Texaikana. I talked with one,bp350.txt
of the citizens concerning the lynch-,bp350.txt

I expected this. I wanted to impress,bp350.txt

The lynching of a Negro at Quincy.,bp369.txt
"Fla, on Tuesday, occurred under cir-",bp369.txt
cumstances of more flagrant neglect by,bp369.txt
the sheriff than many similar cases of,bp369.txt
mob violence in some of the darkest,bp369.txt
years of the history of this peculiarly,bp369.txt
American crime. In most cases of,bp369.txt
"lynching, the sheriff has made much",bp369.txt
more pretense of giving his prisoner,bp369.txt
"protection, than in this instance. There",bp369.txt
were other unusual aspects of this case.,bp369.txt
While the accused man was suspected,bp369.txt
of attempted assault upon a 12-year-,bp369.txt
"old white girl, no formal charge had",bp369.txt
been placed against him. The most,bp369.txt
"extraordinary feature of the case, is",bp369.txt
that the victim was twice taken from,bp369.txt
his legal protectors.,bp369.txt
Only four masked men wrested him,bp369.txt
from the sheriff the first time. He was,bp369.txt
"taken from the jail, beaten and shot,",bp369.txt
and left for dead. The men had not,bp369.txt
done their work well. Their victim,bp369.txt
dragged himself to the home of an-,bp369.txt
other Negro near. Quincy. There he was,bp369.txt
"again picked up by the sheriff, to be",bp369.txt
taken in an unguarded ambulance to,bp369.txt
Tallahassee. News of this fact leaked,bp369.txt
"out in some mysterious way, and this",bp369.txt
time a band of masked men did their,bp369.txt
work well. The man they had con-,bp369.txt
"demned to death without trial, was",bp369.txt
killed.,bp369.txt
The people who administered this,bp369.txt
"summary execution, with horrible bru-",bp369.txt
"tality, may have been among their vic-",bp369.txt
"tim's accusers, but since no formal",bp369.txt
"charge was made, how do we know that",bp369.txt
it had any basis whatever? There is,bp369.txt
no doubt that many innocent men have,bp369.txt
been lynched.,bp369.txt
There is really little chance that we,bp369.txt
shall ever finally banish the crime of,bp369.txt
"lynching in the South, until we have",bp369.txt
done much more about the background,bp369.txt
which supplies such a favorable setting,bp369.txt
for the crime. When there is a wider,bp369.txt
realization that the Negro should have,bp369.txt
"greater opportunity to live and to work,",bp369.txt
there will be a relaxation of the pres-,bp369.txt
sure designed to hold him down. The,bp369.txt
"year 1919, when thousands of white",bp369.txt
men who had been in the military and,bp369.txt
naval services returned to seek their,bp369.txt
"jobs in the South, was the worst year",bp369.txt
in the modern history of lynching.,bp369.txt
There were 83 lynchings in the United,bp369.txt
"States that year, and 76 of the vicctims",bp369.txt
were Negroes.,bp369.txt
"Lynchings have declined, and Ne-",bp369.txt
groes have gained more political rights,bp369.txt
"than enjoyed in 1919, but we doubt",bp369.txt
"nevertheless, whether their economic",bp369.txt
condition in the South has improved.,bp369.txt
It may even be worse than it was 20 or,bp369.txt
30 years ago. The Negro has been,bp369.txt
"shoved out of the skilled trades, and",bp369.txt
pushed off the best agricultural land.,bp369.txt
Although the thought is one we should,bp369.txt
"like to dismiss, perhaps one reason why",bp369.txt

The question here has to do with,bp376.txt
the size and nature of mobs and the,bp376.txt
technique they employ in disposing,bp376.txt

"gings were identified, we believe.",bp376.txt

people. The question is: did these,bp376.txt
groups constitute mobs? The,bp376.txt
NAACP thinks they did.,bp376.txt
1,bp376.txt
The Tennessee case was quite,bp376.txt
different in nearly all its aspects,bp376.txt
from the Georgia case. Here was,bp376.txt
a situation in which a question of,bp376.txt
civil rights was involved and there,bp376.txt
was general knowledge on the part,bp376.txt
of the mayor of Brownsville and,bp376.txt
other responsible white people in the,bp376.txt
community that certain colored men,bp376.txt
had been threatened with harm if,bp376.txt
they insisted upon the exercise of,bp376.txt
certain civil rights. The mayor had,bp376.txt
"been appealed to, according to re-",bp376.txt
"ports, and had told colored citizens",bp376.txt
that the situation was beyond his,bp376.txt
control. Groups of whites had in-,bp376.txt
timidated colored individuals. and,bp376.txt
"groups. In the end, one colored man",bp376.txt
was the victim of a gang murder.,bp376.txt
according to the evidence. Was this,bp376.txt
gang murder a lynching? When all,bp376.txt

America's Fifth Lynching Fifth Lynching,bp383.txt
America's fifth lynching for 1939 has just come to light,bp383.txt
with the revelation that a Mississippt Negro was tortured to,bp383.txt
death with hot irons for the crimes of refusing to pay for a,bp383.txt
company owned shack which he did not occupy.,bp383.txt
The remarkable thing about this lynching is that it was,bp383.txt
(how reported by any of the large press associations which,bp383.txt
pride themselves on garnering all of the news.,bp383.txt
Had they done so there is no doubt that the innocent,bp383.txt
worker's attempt to stand up for his rights would have been,bp383.txt
garbled and he would have been reported as having insulted,bp383.txt
"a white woman, that despite the fact that he was a deacon",bp383.txt
in his church and obviously a law abiding citizen.,bp383.txt
Hard on the heels of this lynching comes news that the,bp383.txt
Florid brothers who lynched another Negro because of a,bp383.txt
traffic accident have been freed.,bp383.txt

that only the unified protest of thousands of voters will force,bp383.txt

"an anti-lynching law, despite the fact that the circumstances of the",bp424.txt
Duck Hill lynching prove the impotence of such laws to prevent lynch-,bp424.txt
ing. The theory of anti-lynching laws is twofold. Pecuniary penalties,bp424.txt
imposed on communities for lynchings are supposed to restrain the,bp424.txt
lynching urge. But what would a consideration like that have amounted,bp424.txt
in the case of the infuriated mob at Duck Hill. The other part of,bp424.txt
the theory of anti-lynching laws is that by transferring the investiga-,bp424.txt
lion cf lynchings and the trial of offenders to outside tribunals such as,bp424.txt
"federal courts, punishment can be had regardless of local public opinion",bp424.txt
or political pull. History is emphatic as to the fallacy of that. So far as,bp424.txt
"the South is concerned, lynching got its greatest impetus at a time when",bp424.txt
"military rule and federal force laws were in full flower, and in the",bp424.txt
nineties of the last century when the Lodge force bill was being pressed,bp424.txt
"in Congress, lynching was rampant. In northern states where there are",bp424.txt
laws providing for the recovery of damages from counties and local,bp424.txt
"communities by relatives of mob victims, there have been most atro-",bp424.txt
cious mob murders.,bp424.txt
Sincere purpose to abate lynchings is almost entirely absent from the,bp424.txt
present propaganda for a federal anti-lynching law. Back of that move-,bp424.txt
ment-as every literate adult knows-are four elements.,bp424.txt
(1) The remnant of the old Republican party machine seeking des-,bp424.txt
perately to recover the Negro vote in the northern states through which,bp424.txt
"it ruled the nation from the election of 1868, in which that vote first",bp424.txt
swung the balance.,bp424.txt
(2) The Democratic political machines in big cities bidding against,bp424.txt
the G. O. P. for the same bloc vote.,bp424.txt
(3) The Communist groups who have sought for more than 15 years,bp424.txt
to stir up racial strife North and South.,bp424.txt
(4) The strangely assorted groups of psychopaths who take a morbid,bp424.txt
interest in lynchings and in characteristic crimes that lead to lynchings.,bp424.txt
These groups include many queer fish and epicene neurotics who swim,bp424.txt
in the stagnant social pools which have collected back of some of the,bp424.txt
great foundations and other endowments set up by doddering old men,bp424.txt
and women who had more money than sense.,bp424.txt
The latter elements are not motivated at all by any desire to abate,bp424.txt
lynchings. The heavily financed propaganda against the social order of,bp424.txt
the South which was manifested in the Scottsboro case in Alabama and,bp424.txt
in the Herndon case in Atlanta are a dead giveaway as to that. An,bp424.txt
orderly court trial in the South stirs up the degenerate martyr com-,bp424.txt
plexes of these people as much as a lynching.,bp424.txt
In view of the South baiting that accompanies all the agitation for,bp424.txt
"federal anti-lynching laws, it is incumbent upon southern senators and",bp424.txt
representatives to make these facts clear upon the floors of the Houses,bp424.txt

LYNCHING AND “THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE” AND “ THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE ”,bp449.txt
(From The Arizona Daily Star) From The Arizona Daily Star),bp449.txt
After the recent lynching of two Negro boys in Texas the county,bp449.txt
attorney of the county in which the act took place justified the act,bp449.txt
"on the grounds that it ""represented the will of the people."" For",bp449.txt
"an officer of the law charged with protecting life under the law,",bp449.txt
for an official trained and educated in the need of lawful processes,bp449.txt
"in civilized life, to condone such an act is bad enough, but for him",bp449.txt
"to justify it on the spurious grounds that it ""represented the will of",bp449.txt
"the people"" is such a grievous dereliction from duty, and is so",bp449.txt
"fraught with future danger, that it demands an immediate challenge,",bp449.txt
and an explanation of possible consequences.,bp449.txt
"The safety of all people, not merely that of the Negroes is at",bp449.txt
"stake. If mob action can be used to justify this particular act, be-",bp449.txt
"cause it ""represents the will of the people,"" it can be used to justify",bp449.txt
an infinite variety of other acts Down through the centuries of,bp449.txt
"history ""the will of the peoplé"" has been used to justify hideous and",bp449.txt
"monstrous crimes. Even Pilate surrendered Christ, because the mob",bp449.txt
"demanded it. In Germany today, ""the will of the people"" is used",bp449.txt
to excuse the cruel punishment of those who merely express different,bp449.txt
"political opinions, and to justify the shameful treatinent of another",bp449.txt
"group because they have certain blood in their veins. In Russia, too,",bp449.txt
"only last May, 117 individuals were summarily executed, because",bp449.txt
they were accused of having different political beliefs than the rul-,bp449.txt
ing hierarchy. And all of these acts were done because they repre-,bp449.txt
"sented ""the will of the people.""",bp449.txt
This is a serious matter. Many of us lightly gloss over it be-,bp449.txt
cause we do not stop to think of its possible consequences-because,bp449.txt
we have not suffered. But the founders of our country and their,bp449.txt
ancestors in England knew from personal experience and personal,bp449.txt
"sufferings how ""the will of the people"" as expressed mob action,",bp449.txt
can be used to justify oppression. And it was largely from this per-,bp449.txt
sonal experience and personal knowledge that they adopted a written,bp449.txt
constitution as a basic means of protecting themselves and their pos-,bp449.txt
terity from the arbitrary action sponsored by mob rule. Mobs that,bp449.txt
"today lynch Negroes, can later be diverted to lynch other people who",bp449.txt
might dare to express independent thought.,bp449.txt
Most certainly the execution of these two Negro boys did not,bp449.txt
"""represent the will of the people."" It represented the passions of",bp449.txt
the people aroused to beast intensity. If those Texas people only,bp449.txt
realized how the precedent they established might at some time re-,bp449.txt
"turn to plague` them, to justify the act of another kind of mob in",bp449.txt
"depriving them of certain rights or even of their lives, they would",bp449.txt
not condone such action. They would be willing to allow the law to,bp449.txt
"take its course. Assume that the two boys were guilty, they were en-",bp449.txt
"titled to a fair trial, and the protection of the federal constitution.",bp449.txt
The time has come when this shameful blot on American life,bp449.txt
"must be removed. When State authorities refuse to give protection,",bp449.txt
when they brazenly justify the denial of constitutional rights to the,bp449.txt
"weak and penniless, it becomes the duty of the federal government",bp449.txt
"to assert itself. When bok and daring gangsters, by kidnaping and",bp449.txt
"bank robberies, assaulted the citadels of wealth and power, the fed-",bp449.txt
eral government acted with alacrity. It raised and trained an en-,bp449.txt
tirely new force of anforcement officials. Why cannot this same ma-,bp449.txt
chinery be used to defend the constitutional rights of the weak and,bp449.txt
friendless? A few.prison terms for mob leaders would soon bring,bp449.txt
a halt to this barbaric action.,bp449.txt
The safety of all people is at stake. American principles of gov-,bp449.txt
ernment with their protection of life and property is at stake. The,bp449.txt
"beastly and hocdlum passions of a mob do not represent ""the will of",bp449.txt
"the people."" They represent a temporary reversion to barþarism.",bp449.txt
They can be used for acts other than the lynching of Negroes. That,bp449.txt
is why an early end to this disgraceful practice must be made. ·,bp449.txt

It is interesting to note the tendency in lynching reports to,bp454.txt
link Negrocs with the disgraceful affair. It has been vigorously,bp454.txt
denied by race leaders and other authorities that Negroes had any-,bp454.txt
"thing to do with the lynching. If they did, those acquainted with",bp454.txt
the state under which Negroes live in the rural communities can,bp454.txt
readily understand how a class of irresponsible Negroes can be,bp454.txt
easily intimidated into lawless affairs by their white bosses.,bp454.txt

law in his own hands as a result of his suspicion of the courts and,bp454.txt

The good offices of this country have been terribly handicapped,bp454.txt

"The Negro may be a petty offender, but he is not a lyncher",bp454.txt

According to Mrs. Cosby's story,bp466.txt
she was attacked around 6:15 A. M.,bp466.txt

MURDER IN MISSISSIPPI,bp497.txt
Again has the frequently besmirched name of Mississipppi,bp497.txt
been plunged into the muck of barbarism and savagery. With,bp497.txt
"the lynching of to Negroes near Alligator, in Bolivar county,",bp497.txt
"Friday, Mississippi again indicates that its respect for law and",bp497.txt
order is nil.,bp497.txt
The victims of mob murder were charged with having at-,bp497.txt
tempted an attack on a white woman. This may or may not,bp497.txt
have been true. The circumstances were such as to have cast,bp497.txt
doubt that there had been an attempted attack. That may come,bp497.txt
out later.,bp497.txt
But it is a fact that the mob took the two Negroes from,bp497.txt
three arred officers without a struggle. There broke down the,bp497.txt
"law. The officers had no interest, no will in stopping that mob",bp497.txt
or it would have been stopped.,bp497.txt
"For a contrast, Sheriff Newbhill of Dyer county, Tenn.,",bp497.txt
heard rumors that a mob was forming to lynch two white pris-,bp497.txt
oners accused of a really grave offense this week. Sheriff,bp497.txt
Newbill of Tennessee did not wait to find out even if the rumor,bp497.txt
were true. He took his prisoners in a fast car and brought,bp497.txt
them to Memphis to the Shelby county jail. No lynching took,bp497.txt
place. It is reasonable to believe that Sheriff Newbill would,bp497.txt
have taken the same course had his prisoners been Negrocs. And,bp497.txt
it also seems quite likely that Sherifi Newbill would not have,bp497.txt
surrendered any prisoner to a mob without a fight.,bp497.txt
As a result of the conduct of this courageous and dutiful,bp497.txt
"officer, Tennessee's escutcheon is unmarked, where it could",bp497.txt
have casily been fouled for all the world to see and shulder at.,bp497.txt
It is a well and generally known fact that almost any sort,bp497.txt
"of resistance on the part of peace officers will ſoil a moh, which",bp497.txt
"is innately cowardly Any display of determination, as has",bp497.txt
"been proved time and again by men of courage, will disperse a",bp497.txt
"mob, however blood-thirsty it may seem at the time",bp497.txt
Hence it is a natural assumption that when a peace officer,bp497.txt
allows himself to be disarmed by a mob and his prisoner taken,bp497.txt
"from him without any struggle, that either one of two things is |",bp497.txt
"true: The first is that the officer is an arrant coward, and the",bp497.txt
second that he just doesn't give a damn.,bp497.txt
There should be a national law concerning lynchings-a,bp497.txt
law which would punish every peace officer in the county in,bp497.txt
"which a lynching took place, and also render that county sub-",bp497.txt
ject to a heavy Federal penalty for allowing it. President,bp497.txt
"Roosevelt, humanitarian that he is, should foster such a law,",bp497.txt
for only with such sure protection can this nation ever emerge,bp497.txt
from the lawlessness which grips it now.,bp497.txt
Mobs are no respectors of persons. Race means nothing,bp497.txt
"to a moh, if it is allowed to have its way. Our courts, our laws.",bp497.txt
the very machinery of our civilization breaks down horribly,bp497.txt
"every time there is a lynching, and all the soft talk about the",bp497.txt
chastity of the white women cannot alter this one iota. Few,bp497.txt
"people feel that a rapist should not be punished by death, for",bp497.txt
rape is a heinous offense. But we have laws and we have,bp497.txt
"courts, and we are, allegedly, a civilized people. Whenever we",bp497.txt
"condone the work of an irresponsible inob which, after its",bp497.txt
formation secks blood-anybody's blood-then we take a hun-,bp497.txt
"dred, nay a thousand, steps backward in the progress of a sup-",bp497.txt
posedly enlightened and cultured people.,bp497.txt
"Let us have laws which will, for all time, stop this horrid",bp497.txt
"effense against human decency, and against law and order",bp497.txt
There is talk of a law which will make the sheriff of any county,bp497.txt
in Tennessee lose his job automatically once a lynching takes,bp497.txt
place in his territory. Pray God that such a law may be passed,bp497.txt
"in this State and in every state in the Union, for there are few",bp497.txt
peace officers who would not fight a mob to retain their jobs-,bp497.txt
"and if mobs are fought, they are defeated.",bp497.txt
"Shelby county believes in the orderly processes of the law,",bp497.txt
Sheby county is the home of the proposed law cited above.,bp497.txt
Shelby county citizens should be glad that they live in a district,bp497.txt
where respect for the law is high. They should rejoice that they,bp497.txt
"do not live in Bolivar county, Mississippi, where there is no such",bp497.txt
respect And they should foster in every way possible laws,bp497.txt
"that will make lynching a real crime, punishable by law, rather",bp497.txt
than a sport in which a gang of drunken hoodlums engage with-,bp497.txt
out fear in the hilarious pastime of murder.,bp497.txt

"tatives killed the bill in Committee,",bp500.txt

"But, imagine a State Senate enacting a law so",bp500.txt

had its fun.,bp500.txt
Here is an unprejudiced report of what hap-,bp500.txt
pened: The sheriff sprang the trap. Issac Howard,bp500.txt
"plunged through the floor. Said the sheriff: ""That",bp500.txt
"bastard won't bother you any more."" Said father",bp500.txt
"of the girl, ""Hell no.""",bp500.txt

Thus the spectacle went on for over an hour,bp500.txt

THE NEW LYNCHING EXCUSE,bp518.txt
O,bp518.txt
"NCE upon a time, not so very long ago.",bp518.txt
the mobocrats attempted to justify lynch-,bp518.txt
"ing on the theory that ""lynching Negroes",bp518.txt
was the only way it was possible to to protect,bp518.txt
white womanhood from the lust of colored,bp518.txt
3101.,bp518.txt
That was the excuse heralded in the press.,bp518.txt
From every political rostrum throughout the,bp518.txt
"Southland would-be office holders shouted, ""I",bp518.txt
would lead a mob to protect white women-,bp518.txt
the flower of this State-from fiendish Ne-,bp518.txt
"grocs."" And newspapers in the North accepted",bp518.txt
the excuse and gave it support.,bp518.txt
"But Southern white women, tired of being",bp518.txt
"the ""goat"" for the bestial pastime of their",bp518.txt
"sponses, proclaimed that their virtue needed no",bp518.txt
such protection. They dug into the records and,bp518.txt
found that the majority of lynchings were not,bp518.txt
even the result of ALLEGED assaults on white,bp518.txt
It was established as an irrefutable,bp518.txt
fact that lynching was the result of many things,bp518.txt
ther than for the protection of the honor of,bp518.txt
Southern women; Negroes are being lynched,bp518.txt
for talking back to white men and other such,bp518.txt
minor provocations.,bp518.txt
women.,bp518.txt
Since the white women have proclaimed to,bp518.txt
the world that they do not need mobs to pro-,bp518.txt
tect their honor; and since that sham has been,bp518.txt
shattered the lynchers have invented another,bp518.txt
excuse to justify their acts of barbarism. They,bp518.txt
now claim that the slowness of the law is re-,bp518.txt
sponsible for lynching. That the criminal law,bp518.txt
"takes too long to operate, therefore, the mob",bp518.txt
takes the law into its own hands.,bp518.txt
This excuse is being accepted and given,bp518.txt
widespread support by those who should know,bp518.txt
better. The slow machinery of the criminal,bp518.txt
courts is even less responsible for lynchings,bp518.txt
than the now abandoned theory of protecting,bp518.txt
white women. The criminal procedure of Amer-,bp518.txt
ican courts was established to insure justice for,bp518.txt
those accused of crime. Those who are intelli-,bp518.txt
geut understand that the so called delays of the,bp518.txt
courts have saved many innocent man from,bp518.txt
death. At the same time some who are guilty,bp518.txt
have escaped-but after an innocent man has,bp518.txt
been killed or spent long terms in prison it is,bp518.txt
impossible to rectify the mistake or repair the,bp518.txt
damage done through haste.,bp518.txt
It is possible during the hysteria following,bp518.txt
a crime for an innocent victim to be connected,bp518.txt
"with it by a chain of circumstances which, un-",bp518.txt
"explained, points to his guilt. But given time",bp518.txt
he can prove his innocence.,bp518.txt
Where a Negro is accused of a serious crime,bp518.txt
against a white than or woman his successful,bp518.txt
prosecution is as certain as anything can be.,bp518.txt
Certainly this is true in the South where the,bp518.txt
"majority of lynchings occur. The judge, the",bp518.txt
"jury, all of the officials are white and have cer-",bp518.txt
tain fixed ideas before the trial begins. Under,bp518.txt

I cannot now say whether it was my raw,bp536.txt
human goodness or the recollection of my own,bp536.txt
similar predicament some years ago that made,bp536.txt
me so quickly responsive to his appeal. It happened in this wise:,bp536.txt
"I had just lectured in Springfield, Ill., and had boarded, as I thought.",bp536.txt
"a train for Cincinnati, Ohio, where I was booked for the high school",bp536.txt
commencement address the next evening. An attendant had directed me,bp536.txt
"to the wrong train. When I handed the conductor my ticket, he hastily",bp536.txt
scanned it and queried about my destination. On informing him that I,bp536.txt
was bound for Cincinnati I was advised that the train was moving in the,bp536.txt
opposite direction as fast as the wheels would roll. The conductor kindly,bp536.txt
suggested that he would inquire at the next stop about a taxi by which I,bp536.txt
might return to Springfield. The rate was $15. I was not in funds to,bp536.txt
meet the demands of the robber.,bp536.txt
THE TRAIN MASTER then advised that he would carry me to the next,bp536.txt
"town-Pleasant Plains, Sangamon County, sacred to Abraham Lincoln",bp536.txt
-where I might stay over night and catch the same train the next,bp536.txt
morning in time for my Cincinnati engagement. I arrived at this sleepy,bp536.txt
"town about 8 o'clock, and diligently looked all around, but there was no",bp536.txt

Abraham Lincoln's old state where the sun is not allowed to set on a,bp536.txt

Darkness was fast covering the town with the mantle of night.,bp536.txt
looked around and saw opposite the depot what looked like a rustic hotel,bp536.txt
and started in that direction when the lights were suddenly blown out for,bp536.txt
the night. I then returned to the station and listened for the moment to,bp536.txt
the depot crowd indulging in about the same grade of talk as prevailed in,bp536.txt
Lincoln's day. I en put my psychology to work. In the language of,bp536.txt
"Robert Burns, I ""tint my reason a' together."" and picked out a man of",bp536.txt

"my guide, philosopher and friend wended his homeward way and left me",bp536.txt

"mob. In his own typical fashion, Mr. Mencken has catalogued",bp552.txt
the Marylanders along with a few southern states having out-,bp552.txt
standing records for lynching. Not only did the Marylanders,bp552.txt
"take offense at some of Mr. Mencken's criticisms, but the Vir-",bp552.txt
"ginians close by decided that Mr. Mencken included them, and",bp552.txt
they likewise rose to rebuke Mr. Mencken in language not found,bp552.txt
"in the New Testament, to say the least.",bp552.txt
It appears that a lynching took place in Salisbury several,bp552.txt
weeks ago. Quite a little stir was made as a result of the mob,bp552.txt
violence. It was also reported in high places that the members,bp552.txt
of the mob were well known to the local authorities. To make,bp552.txt
"the records read smoothly, the Governor is reported to have",bp552.txt
issued the customary orders to apprehend the lynchers. What,bp552.txt
Mr. Mencken complained of was the evident lack of inclination,bp552.txt
on the part of the local authorities either to carry out the,bp552.txt
orders of the Governor or to make any attempt to apprehend,bp552.txt
"the guilty. In short, the lynchers decided that the party was!",bp552.txt
a success and nothing more was to be said or done about it.,bp552.txt
Mr. Mencken referred to the community responsible for,bp552.txt
the lynching in language typically his own. He certainly did,bp552.txt
"not refer to them in complimentary terms. In fact, he actually",bp552.txt
"called them nicknames, not altogether inapplicable either, and",bp552.txt
this originated the exchange of courtesies.,bp552.txt
It is said that the Marylanders decided to boycott Balti-,bp552.txt
more business houses as a retaliation. It is reported that busi-,bp552.txt
"ness amounting to over $100,000 per day was discontinued with",bp552.txt
certain Baltimore business houses. When this method did not,bp552.txt

change of vituperation was inaugurated. What those white,bp552.txt

"across the bay. The battle of words has ceased and, to all",bp552.txt
"appearances, the exchange of epithets has been discontinued,",bp552.txt

"no one, so far as we have been able to learn, has ever been",bp552.txt
arrested as a result of the lynching. We are of the opinion,bp552.txt

"difference and incompetence. Bannon, who was",bp569.txt
"admittedly mentally abnormal, had confessed to",bp569.txt

sie County jail was so unsafe that the sheriff,bp569.txt
"himself said ""anyone can get out of that jail",bp569.txt
"with a rubber comb.""",bp569.txt
Now here is where criminal negligence comes,bp569.txt
"in. A week before the trial, over the protest of",bp569.txt
"the defense attorney, the State's Attorney or-",bp569.txt
dered Bannon back to Schafer supposedly for,bp569.txt
questioning and placed him in this worthless jail.,bp569.txt
One unarmed deputy was ordered to keep guard,bp569.txt
so the mob which had been denied its victim now.,bp569.txt
had him presented to it on a silver platter. That,bp569.txt
"night the mob came, took Bannon, and strung him",bp569.txt
from a railroad bridge.,bp569.txt
This lynching is directly chargeable to official,bp569.txt
indifference-amounting to criminal negligence.,bp569.txt
The State's Attorney ordered the prisoner from a,bp569.txt
"safe jail to an unsafe one, his excuse being that",bp569.txt
no one had warned him of the approaching crime.,bp569.txt
"Why, of course not! And mind you, the mob was",bp569.txt
made up in the very town in which he lived. The,bp569.txt
sheriff took absolutely no precautions for protect-,bp569.txt
[ing his prisoner in spite of the fact that he knew,bp569.txt
"that feeling was running high. The Governor,",bp569.txt
who appeared to be ignorant of the whole state,bp569.txt
"of affairs, has made the usual promise of an in-",bp569.txt
"vestigation, but up to the present time no results",bp569.txt
have been forthcoming and none will be. If he,bp569.txt
meant business he would have begun with his,bp569.txt
State's Attorney and proceeded next to the sheriff.,bp569.txt
Perhaps the fact that a revival meeting was in,bp569.txt
progress in the town from which the lynching,bp569.txt
party set out may have given added impetus to,bp569.txt
the lynching party. At any rate it is a sad com-,bp569.txt

minister who interested himself in the case was,bp569.txt
"the pastor of Bannon's mother, and he to the",bp569.txt
extent of obtaining a confession.,bp569.txt
If the Federal Council of Churches keeps up,bp569.txt
these investigations it will find that the majority,bp569.txt
of lynchings are easily preventable where officials,bp569.txt
"are determined and alert, and on the contrary",bp569.txt

"in behalf of a Negro, so we may not expect our Southern",bp573.txt
"courts to grow too enthusiastic at the trial of any Negro,",bp573.txt
regardless of his innocence-but a beginning is better than,bp573.txt
nothing. We have had such a beginning in some parts of the,bp573.txt
"South, and Tennessee and Kentucky offer us a sample of that",bp573.txt
beginning.,bp573.txt
"Recently in Kentucky, down in McCracken County, one",bp573.txt
"Sam McGee, a Negro, was tried and convicted of murder. The",bp573.txt
hest report of the trial runs something after the following:,bp573.txt
"The prisoner, under heavy guard, entered a plea of not guilty.",bp573.txt
whereupon the court selected an attorney to defend the pris-,bp573.txt
"oner. The Commonwealth proceeded to offer its testimony,",bp573.txt
which consisted of persons who identified the defendant and,bp573.txt
"connected him with the shooting, and, following this testimony",bp573.txt
"by the Commonwealth, the defense offered nothing. The court",bp573.txt
"proceeded to charge the jury, and it took the jury one hour",bp573.txt
to decide the guilt of the defendant. Here is a case where,bp573.txt
the South is trying to give Negroes accused of crime against,bp573.txt
white people a fair and impartial trial. This is a beginning.,bp573.txt
"Quite feeble, we admit, and decidedly an inadequate expression",bp573.txt
"of the law, but it is a beginning.",bp573.txt
"Down in Tennessee another Negro, Flowers by name, was",bp573.txt
"charged with murder. He was brought into court, and the",bp573.txt
witness who was relied upon to support the charge of murder,bp573.txt
against the defendant was a man who had served a prison term,bp573.txt
"and whose citizenship had been taken from him, thus dis-",bp573.txt
qualifying him to give competent testimony in any court.,bp573.txt
When the disqualifications of this witness were brought to the,bp573.txt
"attention of the judge, he ruled out all such testimony, and",bp573.txt
there was nothing to do but direct an acquittal of the defend-,bp573.txt
ant. This is another attempt to give Negroes a fair and im-,bp573.txt
partial-trial. This attempt appears to us more serious and,bp573.txt
"sincere than the attempt made in McCracken County, Kentucky.",bp573.txt
Just think of what might have happened in either one,bp573.txt
of these cases if no attempt had been made to protect these,bp573.txt
defendants and to give them some sort of a trial. We admit,bp573.txt
that the Southern courts do not take themselves seriously when,bp573.txt
"they are trying Negroes, but we recite the instances above",bp573.txt
"simply as an indication that the South, while not giving Negroes",bp573.txt

THE CHURCH AND LYNCHING CHURCH AND LYNCHING,bp609.txt
Referring to the recent outbreaks of mob violence and,bp609.txt
"lynching in several parts of the South, the Commission on Inter-",bp609.txt
racial Relations says:,bp609.txt
"""The responsibility of our religious leaders is equally",bp609.txt
obvious. Few will doubt that the preachers of the,bp609.txt
"South, if they would, could speedily build a Christian",bp609.txt
sentiment that would no longer tolerate lynchings. Yet,bp609.txt
for the most part they have nothing whatever to say,bp609.txt
about it. The occasional. exceptions are notable. Mean-,bp609.txt

"tinue, no preacher can escape a share of the responsi-",bp609.txt
bility unless he has delivered his soul in an honest ef-,bp609.txt
"fort to make such things impossible.""",bp609.txt
}},bp609.txt
This is a rather strong indictment of the white clergy of,bp609.txt
the South but it is nevertheless true. The Southern white min-,bp609.txt
"isters could wield a powerful influence for justice and right, but",bp609.txt
..whether they will in large numbers do so at any time in the,bp609.txt
near future is open to serious doubt. Here and there a white,bp609.txt
"minister will, like one of the gentlemen of the cloth in Sherman,",bp609.txt
"Texas, rise up and denounce the mistreatment or lynching of a",bp609.txt
"Negro, but as a rule the clergymen keep mum about such savage",bp609.txt
"orgie, if indeed they do not participate in them.",bp609.txt
"It should be remcinbered, however, that the Southern white",bp609.txt
church in its attitude toward the oppressed and persecuted,bp609.txt
Negro is but running true to form. From the earliest days it,bp609.txt
has been more interested in saving the souls of the Negroes in,bp609.txt
Africa than the bodies of those in Dixie. It defended the in-,bp609.txt
"stitution of chattel slavery to the bitter end, was arrayed",bp609.txt
against the embattled freedmen in the terrible decade of the,bp609.txt
"reconstruction, so-called, and in recent years when the revived",bp609.txt
"Ku Klux Klan was whipping, threatening, torturing, hanging",bp609.txt
"and burning whites and blacks, it remained silent or only offered",bp609.txt
half-hearted opposition.,bp609.txt
Sometimes we imagine it is rather naive to expect the,bp609.txt
Southern white church to act in accordance with the teachings,bp609.txt
of Jesus. After all it is more a great white social organization,bp609.txt
"than it is a Christian institution, and one cannot make saints",bp609.txt
out of mobbists by gathering them in churches on Sunday after,bp609.txt
"they have robbed, exploited and persecuted the six preceding",bp609.txt
days. The Interracial Commission might be striking closer to,bp609.txt
the root of the problem if it indicted the business interests of,bp609.txt
"Dixie for the continuation of mob violence. After all, they have",bp609.txt
"always been more powerful than the Southern white church, as",bp609.txt
shown by the fact that the church has always done their bid-,bp609.txt
ding. These interests dominate the press and politics as they,bp609.txt
"do the pulpit; they have always dominated them. Bankers,",bp609.txt
"planters, mill owners, realtors and merchants have but to say",bp609.txt
that lynching must cease and it will cease. That they have not,bp609.txt
seen fit to do so leads us to believe that they think such an,bp609.txt
action would be inimical to their economic interests. It is sig-,bp609.txt
nificant that before the Civil War when the bulk of the Negroes,bp609.txt
were private property and there was more enmity between,bp609.txt
"them and the poor whites than there is today, the business in-",bp609.txt
terests of the South would not permit the Negroes to be harmed,bp609.txt
just as they will not permit their profits to be interfered with,bp609.txt
today by mobs of white mill workers agitating for more wages,bp609.txt

WHEN BERNARD SHAW was asked why he did,bp614.txt

"doom was none other than Dan Moody, Governor of",bp614.txt
the state. When the mob was storming the court house,bp614.txt
a telegram was sent to Governor Moody. In answer he,bp614.txt
"telegraphed: ""Hold the Negro if possible, but don't",bp614.txt
"shoot anybody."" Captain Hamer of the Texas Rangers.",bp614.txt
"said: ""This means that the mob will get the Negro.""",bp614.txt
"Assured of its immunity from shooting, the mob went",bp614.txt

INSTEAD OF STAYING the hand of the mob that,bp614.txt

LYNCHING AND THE DEMOCRATS AND THE DEMOCRATS,bp629.txt
J,bp629.txt
UST when the Democratic Convention was about to open its,bp629.txt
"doors in Houston, Tex., the shadow of shame fell across the",bp629.txt
great state like some evil omen.¯¯A Negro was lynched at,bp629.txt
Houston.,bp629.txt
"This country, by this time, is accustomed to lynchings. The",bp629.txt
only query raised now when a lynching takes place is the query,bp629.txt
as to whether the victim is white or black. Lynchings no longer,bp629.txt
"astound us, so common has become the pastime in the United",bp629.txt
States. When the news spread that a lynching had taken place,bp629.txt
"right at the threshold of the Democratic Convention Hall, many",bp629.txt
"there were who looked upon the incident as a proverbial ""black",bp629.txt
"eye"" to the Democratic Convention and to the Democratic Cam-",bp629.txt
paign soon to be opened all over the country. There was a sort,bp629.txt
of restrained glee among those who preferred to look upon the,bp629.txt
incident as a sin visited upon the Democrats. The lynching per,bp629.txt
"se was lost sight of. In fact, the lynching was accepted as a",bp629.txt
visitation of the ill will of the gods upon the Democrats.,bp629.txt
We hold a different view. We believe that the lynching,bp629.txt
has a different significance. The Republican Convention was,bp629.txt
embarrassed at Kansas City by the daylight robbery of a bank.,bp629.txt
"The bandits were white, and the bank was a white institution.",bp629.txt
The Republicans shook off that embarrassment and proceeded,bp629.txt
orderly to nominate their candidate. The bank robbery per se,bp629.txt
"meant nothing to the Republicans, and they have forgotten it.",bp629.txt
Not so with the lynching. The lynching struck terror to the,bp629.txt
hearts of the Democrats. Houston bowed its head in shame,bp629.txt
mingled with a peculiar embarrassment. The lynching struck,bp629.txt
terror to the whole state of Texas because of the time and place,bp629.txt
of its occurrence. The Republicans may overlook a bank rob;,bp629.txt
"bery, but the Democrats cannot ignore a lynching which took",bp629.txt
place just when they were about to issue their proclamation to,bp629.txt
the public in the form of a party platform. If there ever was a,bp629.txt
"lynching that had any political value, it was the lynching at",bp629.txt
Houston. The Democrats are not going to ignore lynching.,bp629.txt
They are not going to dismiss this national crime with a mere,bp629.txt
slight wave of the hand. They are not going to forget that the,bp629.txt
lynchers and the mob leaders seek out white victims as well as,bp629.txt
black; and we think that the lynching is going to serve to in-,bp629.txt
spire the Democrats to deal boldly with lynching in their party,bp629.txt
platform.,bp629.txt
There will be those who will refer to the lynching during,bp629.txt
the campaign. We can imagine we hear the stump speakers de-,bp629.txt
claring that the Democratic campaign had a lynching as its cur-,bp629.txt
tain raiser. We imagine we can hear the orators charging that,bp629.txt
"lynching to the Democratic party. This will be not only unkind,",bp629.txt
but untrue. The Democrats accept that lynching at Houston,bp629.txt
"with its full significance, and we believe that it will serve to",bp629.txt
"keep before the convention not only the lawlessness of one kind,",bp629.txt
but lawlessness of every kind. Something good may yet come,bp629.txt
out of that lynching. It is hard to conceive that lynching can,bp629.txt
"contribute any good, but somehow we believe the lynching at",bp629.txt
Houston will shake the consciousness of the Democrats; that it,bp629.txt
will bring home to them the necessity for dealing with such an,bp629.txt
offense; and we are of the opinion that the party platform is-,bp629.txt
sued by the Democrats will deal definitely and specifically with,bp629.txt
lynching. If this outrage can be the source of renewed interest,bp629.txt
"in the helplessness of the black citizen in this country, it will",bp629.txt
have served a wonderful purpose; and if the Democrats can see,bp629.txt
"their golden opportunity to convert a shame into a party asset,",bp629.txt
it will redound to the credit of the Democrat party and to the,bp629.txt
convention.,bp629.txt
We deplore lynching wherever it is done and whenever it,bp629.txt
"is done. We think, however, that the lynching at Houston came",bp629.txt
at a time and under circumstances which made it a most un-,bp629.txt
"kind cut which may, in the final analysis, prove to be the most",bp629.txt
significant lynching this country has yet known. We entertain,bp629.txt
the hope that the Democrats will blot out this shame and the,bp629.txt
possibility of its repetition by the adoption of a plank that has,bp629.txt
"teeth in it. We say, “We entertain the hope."" }",bp629.txt

"creature? Well, don't do it!",bp638.txt

a Negro was strung up to a lamp-,bp638.txt

case a Negro was hanged to a tele-,bp638.txt
graph pole and riddled with bullets,bp638.txt
from a hundred pistols.,bp638.txt
All these mob lynchings were in,bp638.txt

in the midst of the highest type of,bp707.txt

graduates of Fiske. The school is,bp707.txt

selves. We are mortified that such,bp707.txt
would ever occur in this city. The,bp707.txt
"Mann act, of course, has no effect on",bp707.txt

"The girl's story aroused the community, for she was definite",bp5.txt
"to the last degree in her story, and described in fullest detail the",bp5.txt
appearance of the assailant-who she declared to be slightly built,bp5.txt
"wearing a felt hat, brown suit, green mackinaw and tan shoes",bp5.txt
and even told of a crack in the leather of his shoe near the right toe,bp5.txt
Every Negro seen on the streets of South Orange became an,bp5.txt
"object of suspicion, and this feeling extended to every town within",bp5.txt
a radius of twenty miles. Feeling was at high tension and police,bp5.txt
officers were strenuous in their search for the alleged miscreant.,bp5.txt
Then came embarrassment for the officials and the girl's family.,bp5.txt
The girl became conscious stricken and lost her nerve. She,bp5.txt
told the truth. She declared that she had invented the whole tale,bp5.txt
her story was that she had entered her mother's room in search of,bp5.txt
"a book and had been confronted by the robber, who proceeded to",bp5.txt
do the things she had charged against her imaginary creation.,bp5.txt

tion of lynching-The mob lynched its victim because of the insuffi-,bp6.txt
But,bp6.txt
ciency of laws against the crime of which he was accused.,bp6.txt
what about the thousands of Negroes that have been lynched? In,bp6.txt
each case of guilt there was plenty of law covering the crime. Take,bp6.txt
"the revoltingly atrocious instance which happened at Estill Springs,",bp6.txt
"Tenn., only a few weeks ago. The victim was accused of murder.",bp6.txt
"After he was captured by the mob, he was first tortured with red-hot",bp6.txt
irons and then burned alive. The laws of the state of Tennessee,bp6.txt
provide that murder shall be punished by death; and there is not the,bp6.txt
least doubt that if Jim McIlheron had been tried by a court he would,bp6.txt
have had the full penalty imposed upon him.,bp6.txt
Lynching mobs are not actuated by any desire to uphold justice,bp6.txt
and the law; they are actuated by sheer devilishness and contempt,bp6.txt
for law. It is not unlikely that in the mob which lynched Jim Mc-,bp6.txt
"Ilheron at Estill Springs there were unpunished murderers, men",bp6.txt
who had killed their man and escaped both trial and punishment.,bp6.txt
"At any rate, after the lynching almost every white man in the com-",bp6.txt

"What city, county and state officials need to suppress lynching",bp6.txt
"is not more laws, but the sense of duty and the courage to enforce",bp6.txt
the existing laws. No mob will face an officer determined to do his,bp6.txt
duty.,bp6.txt
The trouble is that in many communities there is a disregard,bp6.txt
of law on the part of the people and the officials. There are wide,bp6.txt
sections of the country in which there is not a single officer with the,bp6.txt
"courage to enforce the law he has sworn to uphold, and which he is",bp6.txt
being paid to uphold. There are wide sections of the country in,bp6.txt
which some excuse to lynch a Negro is seized upon whenever the,bp6.txt
desire is felt for a little extra excitement.,bp6.txt
"Naturally, the frequency with which Negroes may be lynched",bp6.txt
"with impunity dulls the excitement, and the blood lust of the mobs",bp6.txt
will begin to demand white victims.,bp6.txt
The red stain of lynching has been growing deeper and bigger,bp6.txt
"for thirty years; and if something is not done to wipe it out, it will",bp6.txt

Prager is said to have addressed a meeting in an adjoining town,bp6.txt
"the night before, and it was alleged that he had talkekd Sosialism",bp6.txt

and captured him in Collinsville. He was compelled to march,bp6.txt

The police rescued him and hid him in the city hall basement. Later,bp6.txt
the mob demanded the prisoner and when refused rushed the police,bp6.txt
"and dragged him out, led him away with a noose around his neck",bp6.txt
and hanged him.,bp6.txt
Subsequent dispatches state that no evidence of disloyalty on,bp6.txt
Prager's part has been established. He was a miner and was said,bp6.txt
to have had his first papers of citizenship. But with this man's in-,bp6.txt

The mayor declared that he would launch no investigation on,bp6.txt

the attitude of these so-called better classes of the Southern people and,bp7.txt
"their lawmakers. With a few noble exceptions, the upper classes of",bp7.txt

THE CHRISTIAN EDUCATOR.,bp7.txt
"IT IS COLOR THEN, NOT CRIME.",bp7.txt
"Again, I do not believe it, and deny it, because the charge is not",bp7.txt
"so much against the crime itself, as against the color of the man alleged",bp7.txt
"to be guilty of it. Slavery itself, you will remember, was a system of",bp7.txt
"legalized outrage upon the black women of the South, and no white",bp7.txt
"man was ever shot, burned, or hanged for availing himself of all the",bp7.txt
power that slavery gave him at this point.,bp7.txt
"Upon these grounds, then-grounds which I believe to be solid and",bp7.txt
"immovable-I dare here, and now in the Capital of the Nation, my",bp7.txt
"home, and in the presence of Congress, to reject it, and ask you, my",bp7.txt
"reader, and all just men, to reject this horrible charge so frequently",bp7.txt
made and construed against the Negro as a class.,bp7.txt
To sum up my argument on this lynching business: It remains to,bp7.txt
be said that I have shown that the Negro's accusers in this case have,bp7.txt
"violated their oaths, and have cheated the Negro out of his vote; that",bp7.txt
they have robbed and defrauded the Negro systematically and persist-,bp7.txt
"ently, and have boasted of it. I have shown that when the Negro",bp7.txt
"had every opportunity to commit the crime now charged against him,",bp7.txt
he was never accused of it by his bitterest enemies. I have shown,bp7.txt
"that during all the years of reconstruction, when he was being murdered",bp7.txt
"at Hamburg, Yazoo, New Orleans, Copiah, and elsewhere, he was never",bp7.txt
"accused of the crime now charged against him. I have shown that, in",bp7.txt
"the nature of things, no such change in the character and composition",bp7.txt
of a people as this charge implies could have taken place in the limited,bp7.txt
period allowed for it. I have shown that those who accuse him dare,bp7.txt
"not confront him in a court of law, and have their witnesses subjected",bp7.txt
"to proper legal inquiry. And in showing all this, and more, I have",bp7.txt
shown that they who charge him with this foul crime may be justly,bp7.txt
doubted and deemed unworthy of belief.,bp7.txt
HUMAN AND INHUMAN NATURE.,bp7.txt
But I shall be told by many of my Northern friends that my argu-,bp7.txt
"ment, though plausible, is not conclusive. It will be said that the",bp7.txt
"charges against the Negro are specific and positive, and that there must",bp7.txt
"be some foundation for them, because, as they allege, men in their nor-",bp7.txt
mal condition do not shoot and hang their fellow-men who are guilt-,bp7.txt
"less of crime. Well! This assumption is very just, very charitable.",bp7.txt
I only ask something like the same justice and charity could be shown,bp7.txt
to the Negro as well as to the mob. It is ereditable to the justice and,bp7.txt
humanity of the good people of the North by whom it is entertained.,bp7.txt
They rightly assume that men do not shoot and hang their fellow-men,bp7.txt
without just cause. But the vice of their argument is in their assump-,bp7.txt
THE CHRISTIAN EDUCATOR.,bp7.txt
107,bp7.txt
tion that the lynchers are like other men. The answer to that argu-,bp7.txt
"ment is, what may be truly predicated of human nature under one",bp7.txt
condition is not what may be true of human nature under another.,bp7.txt
Uncorrupted human nature may shudder at the commission of such,bp7.txt
crimes as those of which the Southern mob is guilty.,bp7.txt
"But human nature uncorrupted is one thing, and human nature",bp7.txt
corrupted and perverted by long abuse of irresponsible power is quite,bp7.txt
another and different thing. No man can reason correctly on this,bp7.txt
question who reasons on the assumption that the lynchers are like,bp7.txt
ordinary men.,bp7.txt
"We are not, in this case, dealing with men in their natural condi-",bp7.txt
"tion, but with men brought up in the exercise of arbitrary power.",bp7.txt
"We are dealing with men whose ideas, habits, and customs are entirely",bp7.txt
"different from those of ordinary men. It is, therefore, quite gratuitous",bp7.txt
to assume that the principles that apply to other men apply to the,bp7.txt
"Southern murderers of the Negro, and just here is the mistake of",bp7.txt
the Northern people. They do not see that the rules resting upon the,bp7.txt
justice and benevolence of human nature do not apply to the mobo-,bp7.txt
"crats, or to those who were educated in the habits and customs of a",bp7.txt
slaveholding community. What these habits are I have a right to,bp7.txt
"know, both in theory and in practice.",bp7.txt
THE LYNCHERS AND THE LYNCHED.,bp7.txt
"I repeat: The mistake made by those who, on this ground, object to",bp7.txt
"my theory of the charge against the Negro is, that they overlook the",bp7.txt
"natural effect and influence of the life, education, and habits of the",bp7.txt
"lynchers. We must remember that these people have not now, and",bp7.txt
"have never had, any such respect for human life as is common to other",bp7.txt
"men. They have had among them for centuries a peculiar institution,",bp7.txt
and that peculiar institution has stamped them as a peculiar people.,bp7.txt
"They were not before the War, they were not during the War, and",bp7.txt
"have not been since the War, in their spirit or in their civilization, a",bp7.txt
people in common with the people of the North. I will not here har-,bp7.txt
row up your feelings by detailing their treatment of Northern prisoners,bp7.txt
during the War. Their institutions have taught them no respect for,bp7.txt
"human life, and especially the life of the Negro. It has, in fact, taught",bp7.txt
them absolute contempt for his life. The sacredness of life which,bp7.txt
"ordinary men feel does not touch them anywhere. A dead Negro is,",bp7.txt
"with them, a common jest.",bp7.txt
They care no more for a Negro's right to live than they care for,bp7.txt
his rights to liberty or his rights to the ballot. Chief-Justice Taney,bp7.txt

Not a breeze comes to us now from the late rebellious States that,bp7.txt
is not tainted and freighted with Negro blood. In its thirst for blood,bp7.txt
"and its rage for vengeance, the mob has blindly, boldly, and defiantly",bp7.txt
"supplanted sheriffs, constables, and police. It has assumed all the",bp7.txt
"functions of civil authority. It laughs at legal processes, courts, and",bp7.txt

CRIME AGAINST CRIMINALS.,bp7.txt
"We claim to be a Christian country and a highly civilized Nation,",bp7.txt
yet I fearlessly affirm that there is nothing in the history of savages,bp7.txt
to surpass the blood-chilling horrors and fiendish excesses perpetrated,bp7.txt
against the colored people by the so-called enlightened and Christian,bp7.txt
people of the South. It is commonly thought that only the lowest,bp7.txt
"and most disgusting birds and beasts, such as buzzards, vultures, and",bp7.txt
"hyenas, will gloat over and prey upon dead bodies; but the Southern",bp7.txt
"mob, in its rage, feeds its vengeance by shooting, stabbing, and burn-",bp7.txt
ing when their victims are dead.,bp7.txt
"Now, the special charge against the Negro by which this ferocity is",bp7.txt
"justified, and by which mob law is defended by good men North and",bp7.txt
"South, is alleged to be assaults by Negroes upon white women. This",bp7.txt
"charge once fairly started, no matter by whom or in what manner,",bp7.txt
"whether well or ill founded, whether true or false, is certain to subject",bp7.txt
the accused to immediate death. It is nothing that in the case there,bp7.txt
may be a mistake as to identity. It is nothing that the victim pleads,bp7.txt
"""not guilty."" It is nothing that he only asks for time to establish his",bp7.txt
"innocence. It is nothing that the accused is of fair reputation, and his",bp7.txt
accuser is of an abandoned character. It is nothing that the majesty,bp7.txt
of the law is defied and insulted. No time is allowed for defense or ex-,bp7.txt

101,bp7.txt
THE CHRISTIAN EDUCATOR.,bp7.txt
"Of course I shall not be able to succeed in doing the impossible,",bp7.txt
but this one thing I can and will do. I can and will show that there,bp7.txt
are sound reasons for doubting and denying this horrible and hell-black,bp7.txt
charge of rape as the peculiar crime of the colored people of the,bp7.txt
South. My doubt and denial are based upon two fundamental and,bp7.txt
invincible grounds.,bp7.txt
100,bp7.txt
THE NATURAL PRESUMPTIVE EVIDENCE.,bp7.txt
The first is the well-established and well-tested character of the,bp7.txt
Negro on the very point upon which he is now violently and persist-,bp7.txt
ently accused. The second ground for my doubt and denial is based,bp7.txt
upon what I know of the character and antecedents of the men and,bp7.txt
women who bring this charge against him. I undertake to say that,bp7.txt
the strength of this position will become more manifest as I proceed,bp7.txt
with my argument.,bp7.txt
"At the outset I deny that a fierce and frenzied mob is, or ought",bp7.txt
"to be deemed, a competent witness against any man accused of any",bp7.txt
crime whatever. The ease with which a mob can be collected and the,bp7.txt
"slight causes by which it may be set in motion, and the elements of",bp7.txt
"which it is composed, deprive its testimony of the qualities that should",bp7.txt
inspire confidence and command belief. It is moved by impulses,bp7.txt
utterly unfavorable to an impartial statement of the truth. At the,bp7.txt
"outset, therefore, I challenge the credibility of the mob; and as the",bp7.txt
"mob is the main witness in the case against the Negro, I appeal to the",bp7.txt
common sense of mankind in support of my challenge. It is the mob,bp7.txt
"that brings this charge, and it is the mob that arraigns, condemns,",bp7.txt
"and executes, and it is the mob that the country has accepted as its",bp7.txt
witness.,bp7.txt
"Again, I impeach and discredit the veracity of Southern men gener-",bp7.txt
"ally, whether mobocrats or otherwise, who now openly and deliberately",bp7.txt
"nullify and violate the provisions of the Constitution of their country, a",bp7.txt
Constitution which they have solemnly sworn to support and execute.,bp7.txt
"I apply to them the legal maxim, ""False in one, false in all.""",bp7.txt
"Again, I arraign the Negro's accuser on another ground. I have",bp7.txt
no confidence in the truthfulness of men who justify themselves in,bp7.txt
cheating the Negro out of his Constitutional right to vote. The men,bp7.txt
"who, either by false returns or by taking advantage of his illiteracy, or",bp7.txt
surrounding the ballot-box with obstacles and sinuosities intended to,bp7.txt
"bewilder him and defeat his rightful exercise of the elective franchise,",bp7.txt
are men who are not to be believed on oath. That this is done in the,bp7.txt
"Southern States is not only admitted, but openly defended and justified",bp7.txt
by so-called honorable men inside and outside of Congress.,bp7.txt
THE CHRISTIAN EDUCATOR.,bp7.txt
"circumstances have made necessary a sterner, stronger, and more ef-",bp7.txt
"fective justification of Southern barbarism; and hence, according to",bp7.txt
"my theory, we now have to look into the face of a more shocking and",bp7.txt
"blasting charge than either Negro supremacy or insurrection, or that of",bp7.txt
murder itself.,bp7.txt
105,bp7.txt
"This new charge has come at the call of new conditions, and noth-",bp7.txt
ing could have been hit upon better calculated to accomplish its pur-,bp7.txt
pose. It clouds the character of the Negro with a crime the most re-,bp7.txt
"volting, and is fitted to drive from him all sympathy, and all fair play,",bp7.txt
and all mercy. It is a crime that places him outside of the pale of the,bp7.txt
"law, and settles upon his shoulders a mantle of wrath and fire that",bp7.txt
blisters and burns into his very soul.,bp7.txt
TO BLAST AND RUIN CHARACTER.,bp7.txt
"It is for this purpose, as I believe, that this new charge, unthought-",bp7.txt
"of in the times to which I have referred, has been largely invented, if",bp7.txt
not entirely trumped up. It is for this purpose that it has been con-,bp7.txt
stantly reiterated and adopted. It was to blast and ruin the Negro's,bp7.txt
character as a man and a citizen.,bp7.txt
I need not tell you how thoroughly it has already done its wonted,bp7.txt
work. You may feel its malign influence in the very air. You may,bp7.txt
read it in the faces of men. It has cooled our friends. It has,bp7.txt
"heated our enemies, and arrested in some measure the efforts that good",bp7.txt
men were wont to make for the colored man's improvement and ele-,bp7.txt
vation. It has deceived our friends at the North and many good,bp7.txt
friends at the South; for nearly all have in some measure accepted the,bp7.txt
charge as true. Its perpetual reiteration in our newspapers and maga-,bp7.txt
zines has led men and women to regard us with averted,bp7.txt
"ing hate, and dark suspicion.",bp7.txt
"eyes, increas-",bp7.txt
Some of the Southern papers have denounced me for my unbelief,bp7.txt
"in their new departure; but I repeat I do not believe it, and firmly",bp7.txt
"deny it. I reject it because I see in it evidence of an invention, called",bp7.txt
"into being by a well-defined motive, a motive sufficient to stamp it as",bp7.txt
gross expedient to justify murderous assault upon a long-enslaved and,bp7.txt
hence a hated people.,bp7.txt
"I do not believe it, because it bears on its face the marks of being",bp7.txt
"a makeshift for a malignant purpose. I reject it, not only because it",bp7.txt
was sprung upon the country simultaneously with well-known efforts,bp7.txt
now being industriously made to degrade the Negro by legislative en-,bp7.txt
"actments, and by repealing all laws for the protection of the ballot,",bp7.txt
and by drawing the color-line in all railroad cars and stations and in,bp7.txt
all other public places in the South; but because I see in it a means,bp7.txt
of paving the way for our entire disfranchisement.,bp7.txt

the product and regulate the price of a staple in constant demand,bp7.txt
among every people on the globe.,bp7.txt

slaves represented a capital of,bp7.txt

"under one power, subject to the ultimate control and direction of so",bp7.txt
small a number of men.,bp7.txt
In the closing and more embittered period of the political struggle,bp7.txt
"over the question of slavery, public opinion in the South grew narrow",bp7.txt
and cruel. The mass of the Southern people refused to see anything,bp7.txt
in the anti-slavery movement except fanaticism; they classed Abolition-,bp7.txt

ATROCIOUS CRIME ALLEGED.,bp7.txt
The crime they allege against the Negro is the most revolting which,bp7.txt
men can commit. It is a crime that awakens the intensest abhorrence,bp7.txt
"and invites mankind to kill the criminal on sight. This charge, thus",bp7.txt
"brought against the Negro, and as constantly reiterated by his enemies,",bp7.txt
"is not merely against the individual culprit, as would be in the case with",bp7.txt
"an individual culprit of any other race, but it is in a large measure a",bp7.txt
charge against the colored race as such. It throws over every colored,bp7.txt
"man a mantle of odium, and sets upon him a mark for popular hate",bp7.txt
more distressing than the mark set upon the first murderer. It points,bp7.txt
THE CHRISTIAN EDUCATOR.,bp7.txt
"Any pretense that a guilty Negro, especially one guilty of the crime",bp7.txt
"now charged, would in any case be permitted to escape condign pun-",bp7.txt

"found it necessary to invent, adopt, and propagate almost every species",bp7.txt
"of falsehood to create sympathy for themselves, and to formulate an",bp7.txt
"excuse for gratifying their brutal instincts, there was never a charge",bp7.txt
then made against a Negro involving an assault upon any white woman,bp7.txt
or upon any little white child. During all this time the white women,bp7.txt
and children were absolutely safe. During all this time there was no,bp7.txt

violence generally. These were the excuses then depended upon; but,bp7.txt
never a word was then said or whispered about Negro outrages upon,bp7.txt

to kill on the ground that it was necessary to check the domination and,bp7.txt
"supremacy of the Negro, and to secure the absolute rule of the Anglo-",bp7.txt
Saxon race.,bp7.txt
It is important to notice that there have been three distinct periods,bp7.txt
"of persecution of Negroes in the South, and three distinct sets of ex-",bp7.txt
cuses for persecution. They have come along precisely in the order in,bp7.txt
which they were most needed. First you remember it was insurrec-,bp7.txt
"tion. When that was worn out, Negro supremacy became the excuse.",bp7.txt
"When that is worn out, now it is assault upon defenseless women. I",bp7.txt
"undertake to say that this order and periodicity is significant, and",bp7.txt
"means something, and should not be overlooked. And now that",bp7.txt
Negro supremacy and Negro domination are no longer defensible as,bp7.txt
"an excuse for Negro persecutions, there has come in due course this",bp7.txt
heart-rending cry about the white women and little white children of,bp7.txt
the South.,bp7.txt
104,bp7.txt
EVIDENT EXPLANATION.,bp7.txt
"Now, I ask what is the rational explanation of this singular",bp7.txt
omission of this charge in the two periods preceding the present?,bp7.txt
Why was not the charge made at that time as now? The Negro,bp7.txt
was the same then as to-day. White women and children were,bp7.txt
the same then as to-day. Temptations to wrong doing were the,bp7.txt
"same then as to-day. Why, then, was not this dreadful charge",bp7.txt
"brought forward against the Negro in war times, and why was it not",bp7.txt
brought forward in reconstruction times?,bp7.txt
"I will tell you; or you, yourselves, have already answered the",bp7.txt
"question. The only rational answer is, that there was no foundation",bp7.txt
"for such a charge, or that the charge itself was either not thought of",bp7.txt
or was not deemed necessary to excuse the lawless violence with which,bp7.txt
the Negro was then pursued and killed. The old charges already,bp7.txt
enumerated were deemed all-sufficient. This new charge has now,bp7.txt
swallowed up,bp7.txt
"all the old ones, and the reason is obvious.",bp7.txt
"Things have changed since then; old excuses were not available,",bp7.txt
and the Negro's accusers have found it necessary to change with them.,bp7.txt
The old charges are no longer valid. Upon them the good opinion,bp7.txt
of the North and of mankind can not be secured. Honest men no,bp7.txt
longer believe in the wornout stories of insurrection. They no,bp7.txt
longer believe that there is just ground to apprehend Negro su-,bp7.txt
premacy. Time and events have swept away these old refuges of lies.,bp7.txt
and,bp7.txt
"They did their work in their day, and did it with terrible energy",bp7.txt
effect; but they are now cast aside as useless. The altered times and,bp7.txt
THE CHRISTIAN EDUCATOR.,bp7.txt
"him out as an object of suspicion and avoidance. Now, it is in this",bp7.txt
"form that you and I, and all of us, are required to meet it and refute",bp7.txt
"it, if that can be done. In the opinion of some of us it is thought",bp7.txt
that it were well to say nothing about it; that the least said about it,bp7.txt
the better. In this opinion I do not concur. Taking this charge in,bp7.txt
"the broad and comprehensive sense in which it is presented, and as now",bp7.txt
"stated, I feel that it ought to be met, and, as a colored man,",bp7.txt
I am,bp7.txt
grateful for the opportunity now afforded me to meet it. For I believe,bp7.txt
"it can be met, and successfully met. I am of opinion that a people",bp7.txt
too spiritless to defend themselves are not worth defending.,bp7.txt
99,bp7.txt
"Without boasting, on this broad issue, as now presented, I am",bp7.txt
"ready to confront Ex-Governor Chamberlain, Bishop Fitzgerald, Bishop",bp7.txt
"Haygood, and Miss Frances Willard, and all others, singly or all to-",bp7.txt
"gether, without any doubt of the result.",bp7.txt
But I want to be understood at the outset. I do not pretend that,bp7.txt
Negroes are saints or angels. I do not deny that they are capable of,bp7.txt
"committing the crime imputed to them, but I utterly deny that they",bp7.txt
are any more addicted to the commission of that crime than is true of,bp7.txt
any other variety of the human family. In entering upon my argu-,bp7.txt
"ment, I may be allowed to say that I appear not as the defender of",bp7.txt
"any man guilty of this atrocious crime, but as the defender of the",bp7.txt
colored people as a class.,bp7.txt
HUMANE AND CHRISTIAN DEFENSE.,bp7.txt
"In answer to the terrible indictment thus read, and speaking for",bp7.txt
"the colored people as a class, I, in their stead, here and now plead",bp7.txt
"not guilty, and shall submit my case with confidence of acquittal by",bp7.txt
good men and women North and South.,bp7.txt
It is the misfortune of the colored people in this country that the,bp7.txt
sins of the few are visited upon the many; and I am here to speak for,bp7.txt
"the many, whose reputation is put in peril by the sweeping charge in",bp7.txt
"question. With General Grant, and every other honest man, my motto",bp7.txt
"is: ""Let no guilty man escape."" But while I say this, I also say,",bp7.txt
"Let no innocent man be condemned and killed by the mob, or",bp7.txt
crushed under the weight of a charge of which he is not guilty.,bp7.txt
You will readily see that the cause I have undertaken to support,bp7.txt
is not to be maintained by any mere confident assertions or general,bp7.txt
"denials. If I had no better ground to stand upon than this, I would",bp7.txt
leave the field of controversy and give up the colored man's cause at,bp7.txt
"once to his able accusers. I am aware, however, that I am here to do",bp7.txt
in some measure what the masters of logic say can not be done-prove,bp7.txt
a negative.,bp7.txt
108,bp7.txt
THE CHRISTIAN EDUCATOR.,bp7.txt
consider that the black man had any rights which the white men were,bp7.txt
"bound to respect."" No man of the South ever called in question that",bp7.txt
"statement, and they never will. They could always shoot, stab, and",bp7.txt
burn the Negro without any such remorse or shame as other men would,bp7.txt
feel after committing such a crime. Any Southern man who is honest,bp7.txt
and is frank enough to talk on the subject will tell you that he has no,bp7.txt
"such idea as we have of the sacredness of human life, and especially,",bp7.txt
"as I have said, of the life of the Negro. Hence it is absurd to meet",bp7.txt
my arguments with the facts predicated of our common human nature.,bp7.txt
LET JUSTICE BE DONE THOUGH THE HEAVENS FALL.,bp7.txt
I know I shall be charged with apologizing for criminals. Ex-,bp7.txt
Governor Chamberlain has already virtually done as much. But there,bp7.txt
is no foundation for any such charge. I affirm that neither I nor any,bp7.txt
"other colored man of like standing with myself, has ever raised a",bp7.txt
finger or uttered a word in defense of any one really guilty of the,bp7.txt
dreadful crime now in question.,bp7.txt
"But what I contend for, and what every honest man, black or",bp7.txt
"white, should contend for, is, that when any man is accused of this or",bp7.txt
"any other crime, of whatever name, nature, or extent, he shall have",bp7.txt
the benefit of a legal investigation; that he shall be confronted by his,bp7.txt
"accusers; and that he shall, through proper counsel, be able to question",bp7.txt
"his accusers in open court and in open daylight, so that his guilt or his",bp7.txt
innocence may be duly proved and established.,bp7.txt
"If this is to make me liable to the charge of apologizing for crime,",bp7.txt
I am not ashamed to be so charged. I dare to contend for the colored,bp7.txt
people of the United States that they are a law-abiding people; and I,bp7.txt
"dare to insist upon it that they, or any man, black or white, accused",bp7.txt
"of crime, shall have a fair trial before he is punished.",bp7.txt
BLAINE ON SLAVERY AND THE SOUTH.,bp7.txt
THE slaves in the United States numbered about seven hundred,bp7.txt
thousand when Washington's Administration was organized. They,bp7.txt
had increased to four millions when Lincoln was chosen President.,bp7.txt
Their number in 1860 was less in proportion to the white population,bp7.txt
than it was in 1789. The immigration of whites had changed the,bp7.txt
ratio. But the more marked and important change had been in the,bp7.txt
value of slave-labor. In 1789 the slaves produced little or no sur-,bp7.txt
"plus, and in many States were regarded as a burden. In 1860 they",bp7.txt
produced a surplus of at least three hundred millions of dollars.,bp7.txt

"The Negroes, therefore, undoubtedly",bp8.txt
will continue to live as a special race,bp8.txt
"among their Anglo-Saxon neighbors,",bp8.txt
And centuries will pass by before that,bp8.txt

During the last Grand Army en-,bp8.txt
"campment in Boston, I observed an",bp8.txt
old veteran marching along slowly,bp8.txt
and tired in a white regiment.,bp8.txt
longside of the honorable army who,bp8.txt
"once saved the Union, were posted",bp8.txt
young ladies from the best society of,bp8.txt
"Boston, who offered the veterans",bp8.txt
"cold water to drink, which was indeed",bp8.txt
a welcome refreshment to the march-,bp8.txt
ing soldiers. All the white comrades,bp8.txt
"had already been administered to,",bp8.txt
but nobody cared for the black vet-,bp8.txt
eran. Once he was good enough to,bp8.txt
bleed for a country which had allow-,bp8.txt
"ed shackles to be put on his feet, but",bp8.txt
now he was not worthy of a drink of,bp8.txt
water. He looked sore and worn out.,bp8.txt
At last a young lady stepped forward,bp8.txt
and offered him a glass of water. I,bp8.txt
never saw a face undergo such a,bp8.txt
change as now did that of the old,bp8.txt
veteran. In a moment he was all,bp8.txt
sunshine. Every muscle and fibre in,bp8.txt
that black image was bright with,bp8.txt
smile and joy. And the smile did,bp8.txt
not cease. It remained there like a,bp8.txt
sunshine on a dark clould. I followed,bp8.txt
"him for a quarter of an hour,and still",bp8.txt
the smile was on his face and in his,bp8.txt
"eyes; and it was a hearty, good-na-",bp8.txt
"tured smile, a smile of a happy child.",bp8.txt

EIGNERS VIEW OF IT.,bp8.txt
"(Twentieth Century, New York, Sept. 8)",bp8.txt
in,bp8.txt
It seems to me not to be altogether,bp8.txt
out of place for me to make a few,bp8.txt
comments on the race problem,bp8.txt
this country. Born and educated in,bp8.txt
Europe I may perhaps not be able to,bp8.txt
view this question from the same,bp8.txt
"standpoint as native Americans, and",bp8.txt
perhaps not even have a right to,bp8.txt
meddle with it. But at the same,bp8.txt
time I think that my being a stranger,bp8.txt
enables me to look at this problem,bp8.txt
"with dispassionate eyes, which will",bp8.txt
help me to do justice to the parties,bp8.txt
"involved. However that may be, I",bp8.txt
"beg leave to say what I think, having",bp8.txt
paid some attention to the subject,bp8.txt
during several years.,bp8.txt
Europe has been and still is vexed,bp8.txt
by race problems. None of them is,bp8.txt
solved. But there races about equal,bp8.txt
in education and intelligence live,bp8.txt
"side by side in the same community,",bp8.txt
with the same rights under the same,bp8.txt
government. They tolerate each,bp8.txt
"other, that's all. But where the",bp8.txt
"races are very much different, as the",bp8.txt
"case is with the Jews, even tolerance",bp8.txt
cannot always be maintained.,bp8.txt
"wars, then, still occur. As far as I",bp8.txt
"know, there is only one instance in",bp8.txt
Europe of an inferior race living in,bp8.txt
the same country as a superior one,bp8.txt
The Laps in Northern Europe are,bp8.txt
"nomads, or only half civilized.",bp8.txt
"they, as their kinsfolk, the Chinese",bp8.txt
"are quiet and retired, and give no",bp8.txt
cause for serious troubles.,bp8.txt
Race,bp8.txt
But,bp8.txt
The colored race in this country is,bp8.txt
essentially different from any race,bp8.txt
in Europe. The colored people are,bp8.txt
"a progressive people, capable of de-",bp8.txt
"velopement, and fitted to become",bp8.txt
civilized. At the same time they,bp8.txt
"have their race peculiarities, and are",bp8.txt
neither physically nor mentally,bp8.txt
evolved from the state of savagery.,bp8.txt
But it is only a question of time,bp8.txt
when they will be. The white races,bp8.txt
have gone through the same process,bp8.txt
of evolution though under different,bp8.txt
conditions.,bp8.txt
Some time ago I lived in a State,bp8.txt
where the colored people contributed,bp8.txt
a large proportion to the population.,bp8.txt
I took pains to see how they lived,bp8.txt
and how they were getting along.,bp8.txt
At an average they were in about,bp8.txt
the same state as the poor people in,bp8.txt
the large cities of Europe. They,bp8.txt
were neither more poor nor more,bp8.txt
morally degraded or ignorant. The,bp8.txt
only difference I could notice was,bp8.txt
undoubtedly due to racial and cli-,bp8.txt
matic conditions. Their sexual in-,bp8.txt
"clinations are strong, no doubt, but",bp8.txt
such is the case with all people liv-,bp8.txt
ing in a hot climate. White men,bp8.txt
very much oftener committed rape,bp8.txt
on colored girls than colored men,bp8.txt
were guilty of the same crime to-,bp8.txt
ward white women. But invariably,bp8.txt
"the colored rapist was lynched, but",bp8.txt
not the white one. And neverthe-,bp8.txt
"less, the crime of the latter was",bp8.txt
"greater than that of the former one,",bp8.txt
"For, leaving out of the question the",bp8.txt
fact that slavery was demoralizing,bp8.txt
to the colored people in this very,bp8.txt
"respect, not only the law, but also",bp8.txt
the public opinion of our people re-,bp8.txt
LYNCHINE,bp8.txt
gards crimes toward inferiors a,bp8.txt
greater offenses than crimes toward,bp8.txt
equals. If a white man commits,bp8.txt
"rape on a child, he is punished",bp8.txt
more severely than if his victim had,bp8.txt
"been a full grown woman, which, un-",bp8.txt
"doubtedly, is just, too. Why, then,",bp8.txt
should we make an exception if the,bp8.txt
inferior victim has a black skin?,bp8.txt
"And on the contrary, an inferior",bp8.txt
criminal is not as a rule punished as,bp8.txt
hard as one of higher mental devel-,bp8.txt
"opment, because the responsibility is",bp8.txt
"not the same, Why, then, should",bp8.txt
the Negro be excepted from that,bp8.txt
rule? It seems to me that a formida-,bp8.txt
ble injustice is committed to the,bp8.txt
"lynched colored rapist or criminal,",bp8.txt
for the punishment always ought to,bp8.txt
be proportionate to the responsi-,bp8.txt
bility.,bp8.txt
But the negro problem is a grave,bp8.txt
"one indeed, and it has to be solved or",bp8.txt
"serious troubles may ensue, resulting",bp8.txt
in moral degradation to both parties,bp8.txt
and perhaps to the forming of a,bp8.txt
State within the State by the ex-,bp8.txt
cluded Negro. But how can this,bp8.txt
problem be solved satisfactorily?,bp8.txt
It seems to me that we cannot ex-,bp8.txt
"pect a perfect solution, for different",bp8.txt
races always will be antagonistic to,bp8.txt
each other. The highest goal we can,bp8.txt
aim at is to make the two races toler-,bp8.txt
"ate each other, for we never will get",bp8.txt
"beyond that. And meanwhile, let",bp8.txt
the white people deal justly with the,bp8.txt
colored race and try to educate the,bp8.txt
"coming generations. Education, in-",bp8.txt
"deed, is the capital means for the ele-",bp8.txt
vation of the ex-slave and his chil-,bp8.txt
dren. But not so much the education,bp8.txt
of schools and colleges as the educa-,bp8.txt
tion of life. I would not claim social,bp8.txt
recognition for the Negro now and at,bp8.txt
"once,but certainly it should be accord-",bp8.txt
"ed to him as soon as he deserves it,",bp8.txt
for else he will be kept back and his,bp8.txt
progress stopped. A colored Baptist,bp8.txt
"minster once said to me: ""What is",bp8.txt
the use of the Negro getting educated,bp8.txt
and graduating from a college or a,bp8.txt
"high school, for the only way open to",bp8.txt
"him is this."" Saying so, he pointed",bp8.txt
to a gang of colored men who were,bp8.txt
busy with grading a street. I have,bp8.txt
conversed with Negroes who were,bp8.txt
just as intelligent and who behaved,bp8.txt
"just as nicely as any white person, and",bp8.txt
have even been superior to the aver-,bp8.txt
"age white man, and I do not see why",bp8.txt
the color of the skin should exclude,bp8.txt
such a man from the company of his,bp8.txt
white equals ar even superiors. An,bp8.txt
educated and noble-minded Negro is,bp8.txt
not more of a savage than the Presi-,bp8.txt
dent of the United States. The Ne-,bp8.txt
gro has many qualities which are apt,bp8.txt
"to make him, when educated and re-",bp8.txt
"fined, a pleasant companion in any",bp8.txt
society. I think that especially his,bp8.txt
musical genius is a quality which in,bp8.txt
the future will make his people ac-,bp8.txt
ceptable anywhere. Another way of,bp8.txt
educating the Negro is using him as,bp8.txt
a servant in our families. He then,bp8.txt
will be brought in constant contact,bp8.txt
with the white people and certainly,bp8.txt
will gain by it.,bp8.txt
I do not think the colored race will,bp8.txt
ever be extinet or unite with the,bp8.txt
white race. If the population of,bp8.txt
America had been principally made,bp8.txt
"up of French and Germans, such",bp8.txt
might have been the fate of the color-,bp8.txt
"ed people, but the Angle-Saxon race",bp8.txt
never mixes with other races. We,bp8.txt

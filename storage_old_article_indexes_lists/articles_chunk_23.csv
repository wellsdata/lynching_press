efforts of Sheriff Richards of Asotin,91513_0.txt

"sworn in 25 deputies to guard him,",91513_0.txt
"William Hamilton, a well- to- do farmer,",91513_0.txt
the self- confessed murderer of little,91513_0.txt
"Mabel Richards, was forcibly taken",91513_0.txt
from the Asotin county jail early today,91513_0.txt
and lynched by a mob of over,91513_0.txt
"1,000 men from all parts of Asotin",91513_0.txt
county.,91513_0.txt
About 12:15 o'clock this morning a,91513_0.txt
"band of masked men, their faces concealed",91513_0.txt
with handkerciefs marched up,91513_0.txt
",",91513_0.txt
the street to the county jail.,91513_0.txt
The officers and guards were swept,91513_0.txt
aside by the mob. When the cell containing,91513_0.txt
the guilty man was reached no,91513_0.txt
key could be found to fit. It was ne,91513_0.txt
the bars.,91513_0.txt
cessary to saw What Ham,91513_0.txt
ilton said probably will not be learned.,91513_0.txt
After 15 minutes' delay he was dragged,91513_0.txt
out of the cell and down into the,91513_0.txt
yard.,91513_0.txt
"Meanwhile, another company of",91513_0.txt
masked men had marched up the,91513_0.txt
street and taken position opposite the,91513_0.txt
jail. They kept back the crowd which,91513_0.txt
had filled the all night. Soon,91513_0.txt
there came a procession streets from the jail,91513_0.txt
yard. On each side of the prisoner,91513_0.txt
was a masked man clutching the murderer's,91513_0.txt
arm. Beside him another masked,91513_0.txt
"man pressed closely, with his hand",91513_0.txt
over the murderer's mouth to prevent,91513_0.txt
a possible outcry. Other members of,91513_0.txt
the jail storming mob came behind. As,91513_0.txt
the group came forward those who had,91513_0.txt
been guarding the entrance formed a,91513_0.txt
"chain about captive and captors, and in",91513_0.txt
"this manner they proceeded, keeping",91513_0.txt
the crowd at a distance. At First and,91513_0.txt
Fillmore streets they halted under a,91513_0.txt
guy wire which crosses the street and,91513_0.txt
connects electric light poles. Here,91513_0.txt
one of the leaders asked Hamilton if,91513_0.txt
"he wanted to confess. He did so, admitting",91513_0.txt
that he outraged the sheriff's,91513_0.txt
"child, 11 years old, and then killed her.",91513_0.txt
His words were not heard more than,91513_0.txt
ten feet away. Finally he asked that,91513_0.txt
his jewelry and some trifling trinkets,91513_0.txt
be given to his father and mother. It,91513_0.txt
was promised that this would be done.,91513_0.txt
Some of the mob thought hanging,91513_0.txt
"good and wanted to torture him,",91513_0.txt
But the original program prevailed.,91513_0.txt
Some one produced a black mask,91513_0.txt
lik that used in a legal hanging and,91513_0.txt
it was put over the head of Hamilton.,91513_0.txt
It reached down to his shoulders. A,91513_0.txt
rope was then placed about his neck,91513_0.txt
and thrown over the guy wire. It was,91513_0.txt
"seized by many hands, the body was",91513_0.txt
lifted off the ground and suspended at,91513_0.txt
a h√©ight of about four feet. The doomed,91513_0.txt
man began to gasp for breath and,91513_0.txt
his efforts were plainly discernable a,91513_0.txt
distance of two blocks. When life was,91513_0.txt
extinct the rope was made fast to the,91513_0.txt
telegraph pole and the body left suspended,91513_0.txt
The crowd immediately dispersed,91513_0.txt

of last evening's riot at this place.,91514_0.txt
Those injured are:,91514_0.txt
"John Woodruff, marshal of Oxford,",91514_0.txt
believed to be fatally shot.,91514_0.txt

The Spivey brothers were visiting,91514_0.txt
"Edward Richardson of Billingsville,",91514_0.txt
"Ind, just across the state line from Oxford",91514_0.txt
. The three came here to attend,91514_0.txt
the annual street fair and farmers',91514_0.txt
exposition. The town was filled with,91514_0.txt
strangers when these three men began,91514_0.txt
carousing in a saloon. They pulled revolvers,91514_0.txt
on the bartender who ejected,91514_0.txt
",",91514_0.txt
"them, and then they proceeded to raise",91514_0.txt
more trouble in other saloons. When,91514_0.txt
Marshal Woodruff undertook to arrest,91514_0.txt
them he was mortally shot. A fusilade,91514_0.txt
of bullets in the crowded streets followed,91514_0.txt
the shooting of the marshal.,91514_0.txt
Deputy Marshal. Manrod was shot,91514_0.txt
twice when he took the place of his,91514_0.txt
chief. During this fusilade in the,91514_0.txt
"street Ernest Jotten, while returning",91514_0.txt
"from his school to his boarding house,",91514_0.txt
was struck in the abdomen by a stray,91514_0.txt
bullet and he is in a critical condition.,91514_0.txt
After the shooting the three men,91514_0.txt
ran in different directions with crowds,91514_0.txt
after each one and each was hit in,91514_0.txt
the head with stones thrown by those,91514_0.txt
pursuing them. Louis Spivey,91514_0.txt
shot by a citizen. The three men was,91514_0.txt
were finally lodged in jail. Edward,91514_0.txt
Richardson was dismissed after it was,91514_0.txt
shown that he had nothing to do with,91514_0.txt
the shooting and was only accompanyIng,91514_0.txt
the Spivey brothers.,91514_0.txt
Crowds finally concentrated about,91514_0.txt
the jail and battered down the door,91514_0.txt
and took Joseph Spivey out to lynch,91514_0.txt
him. He was hauled from place to,91514_0.txt
place with a rope about his neck and,91514_0.txt
was swung up three different times,91514_0.txt
and yet escaped with his life. In,91514_0.txt
their haste the mob did not pinion his,91514_0.txt
arms or his legs and he managed to,91514_0.txt
use them so as to prevent strangulally,91514_0.txt
tion the first time he was hung. At,91514_0.txt
another time he was let down so that,91514_0.txt
he might write a farewell letter to his,91514_0.txt
wife and children and at another time,91514_0.txt
some one cut the rope. Before the,91514_0.txt
mob finally succeeded in hanging him,91514_0.txt
until he was dead the officers rescued,91514_0.txt
him end rushed him off to the city,91514_0.txt
"prison, where the mob was held at bay",91514_0.txt
for some time and finally order enough,91514_0.txt
was secured for speeches to be made,91514_0.txt
"by ex- Mayor Flannagan, Rev Dr",91514_0.txt
Thomas J. Potter and the brother of,91514_0.txt
Marshal Woodruff. While the speech-,91514_0.txt
es were being delivered the officers,91514_0.txt
spirited the Spivey brothers into the,91514_0.txt
cellar of the jail and thence out,91514_0.txt
through a coal chute and made good,91514_0.txt
their escape with them to the Butler,91514_0.txt
"county jail at Hamilton, O., a distance",91514_0.txt
of fifteen miles. The mob then finding,91514_0.txt
that it had been beaten dispersed and,91514_0.txt
the village was quiet during the latter,91514_0.txt
part of the night.,91514_0.txt
This village with its three large institutions,91514_0.txt
of learning is noted for its,91514_0.txt
"culture and order, but it was the scene",91514_0.txt
over a year ago of the lynching of,91514_0.txt
"Henry Corbin, a negro, for the murder",91514_0.txt
"of Mrs Horner, and a striking feature",91514_0.txt
of the attempted lynching last niglit,91514_0.txt
was the part taken by the,91514_0.txt
"negroes,",91514_0.txt
who protested every time the rope was,91514_0.txt
slackened and Joseph Spivey was let,91514_0.txt
"down to say his prayers, write to his",91514_0.txt
"wife and children, or for any other",91514_0.txt
purpose of mercy. Some of the negroes,91514_0.txt
raised quite a disturbance while proclaiming,91514_0.txt
that if the man had been a,91514_0.txt
negro he would surely have been,91514_0.txt
lynched in the first place without anyone,91514_0.txt
giving heed to his appeals. The,91514_0.txt
"mob was without a leader at any time,",91514_0.txt
but still it probably would not have,91514_0.txt
been folled but for the appeals of,91514_0.txt
Woodruff's brother to let the law,91514_0.txt

girl's refusal to accept his advances.,91545_0.txt
When the girl came to the stable in the,91545_0.txt
"evening Becker shot her to death, sending",91545_0.txt
"eight bullets into her body, after",91545_0.txt
which he set fire to the farmer's,91545_0.txt
stables. At first it was reported the,91545_0.txt
murderer had shot himself and had died,91545_0.txt
"in the flames, but later it became",91545_0.txt
known that he had fled and search was,91545_0.txt
instituted. On April 13 a posse of farmers,91545_0.txt
captured the murderer near St.,91545_0.txt
"John, Stafford County, and for safe",91545_0.txt
keeping he was taken by the Sheriff to,91545_0.txt
"Hutchinson, there having been many",91545_0.txt
threats that he would be lynched if,91545_0.txt
brought here.,91545_0.txt
This morning Becker was brought,91545_0.txt
from Hutchinson to be put upon his,91545_0.txt
preliminary examination. Early in the,91545_0.txt
day farmers from the neighborhood of,91545_0.txt
his crime began coming into town and,91545_0.txt
by 6 o'clock this evening the streets,91545_0.txt
"were thronged. Then, when it became",91545_0.txt
known the murderer had been granted,91545_0.txt
a change of venue to Lyons and that,91545_0.txt
Sheriff Abeer would take nis prisoner,91545_0.txt
east on the Santa Fe train this evening,91545_0.txt
there were signs of threatened,91545_0.txt
"trouble, as a big crowd began to gather",91545_0.txt
"at the railroad depot. Sheriff Abeer,",91545_0.txt
"appreciating the danger, took Becker",91545_0.txt
into a buggy and started for a crossing,91545_0.txt
"east of the city, intending to flag",91545_0.txt
the train there. By this time the crowd,91545_0.txt
at the depot was openly threatening a,91545_0.txt
lynching.,91545_0.txt
When the train pulled in the purpose,91545_0.txt
of the Sheriff's strategy had become apparent,91545_0.txt
"to all. The would- be lynchers,",91545_0.txt
"quick to act, boarded the train and",91545_0.txt
rode on. When the Sheriff at the crossing,91545_0.txt
saw the train was crowded to the,91545_0.txt
"guards he did not flag it, but hurriedly",91545_0.txt
drove back to Great Bend with his,91545_0.txt
prisoner. At Dartmouth the lynching,91545_0.txt
party left the train and started back,91545_0.txt
"to this city, having hired all the conveyances",91545_0.txt
available there. Sheriff Abeer,91545_0.txt
had hurried back and lodged his prisoner,91545_0.txt
at the County Jail.,91545_0.txt
A few minutes before 8 o'clock the,91545_0.txt
mob was swarming round the jail. Evidently,91545_0.txt
believing that he could outwit,91545_0.txt
"the lynchers by flight, the Sheriff",91545_0.txt
rushed Becker out of the jail to his,91545_0.txt
"buggy, but he had no sooner done so",91545_0.txt
than he and his men and the prisoner,91545_0.txt
"were surrounded. The Sheriff, aided by",91545_0.txt
"his deputies, made a stubborn defense,",91545_0.txt
"and the prisoner, realizing the fate that",91545_0.txt
"threatened him, fought desperately",91545_0.txt
with them. After they had fought their,91545_0.txt
way back almost to the entrance to the,91545_0.txt
"jail, the mob, through sheer force of",91545_0.txt
"numbers, prevailed. Securing the murderer",91545_0.txt
", it bore him away to the public",91545_0.txt
square.,91545_0.txt
A rope was drawn around Becker's,91545_0.txt
"neck, and after he had been beaten almost",91545_0.txt
to insensibility the rope was,91545_0.txt
thrown over a limb of a big tree and he,91545_0.txt
was drawn up. Some one in the crowd,91545_0.txt
"gave the body a push, and as the murderer",91545_0.txt
"was being drawn up, his body repeatedly",91545_0.txt
"swung back, scraping upon the",91545_0.txt
trunk of the tree.,91545_0.txt
The Sheriff and his men kept close,91545_0.txt
"upon the heels of the lynchers, but they",91545_0.txt
were held back for fully fifteen minutes,91545_0.txt
", when, it being apparent Becker",91545_0.txt
"was dead, the mob quickly melted away",91545_0.txt
and the murderer's body was cut down,91545_0.txt
by the Sheriff and the Coroner.,91545_0.txt
Though revolvers were drawn and,91545_0.txt
"threats were made, no shots were fired",91545_0.txt
by the Sheriff and his men in their,91545_0.txt
struggle against the lynchers. Many of,91545_0.txt
the lynching party must be known to,91545_0.txt
"the county peace officers, but to- night",91545_0.txt
there is no very strong talk of arrests.,91545_0.txt
The sentiment here seems to be that if,91545_0.txt

"G Joseph Merrill of Carrollton, who, for the purpose of defending a negro committed to his",91565_0.txt
"charge, fired upon a mob of lynchers and dispersed them.",91565_0.txt
The attack was of a nature that put a supreme test upon the Sheriff's courage and,91565_0.txt
fidelity to duty. The negro prisoner had been convicted of the murder of a white boy and sentenced,91565_0.txt
to be hanged. Upon the day appointed for the execution a reprieve was obtained by an,91565_0.txt
"appeal to the Supreme Court, and the mob that had gathered to witness the execution was rendered",91565_0.txt
furious by being balked of its victim. It was easy in such a crowd to raise the cry for lynch,91565_0.txt
law and start an attack upon the jail; but it was not easy for the Sheriff to face the danger. Popular,91565_0.txt
"sentiment in Georgia is not averse to lynching negroes who are but suspected of crime, and",91565_0.txt
therefore it was inevitable that the mob in this case should have looked for no more than a formal,91565_0.txt
"opposition to the attempt to lynch one who had been tried and convicted. The mob, however, was",91565_0.txt
mistaken. The Sheriff of Carrollton is an officer who knows his duty and has the courage to fulfill,91565_0.txt
"it. He warned the assailants to retire, and when in defiance they broke into the jail he fired upon",91565_0.txt

"When officials fail in the performance of duty in the face of mob violence, the country is",91565_0.txt

her intimate friend and had coaxed her,91592_0.txt
to sign a paper stating that her brothers,91592_0.txt
had killed Morris. She related how,91592_0.txt
Brown knew that the statement was,91592_0.txt
"false, but that he told her to sign it anyway",91592_0.txt
", because if she would it would prove",91592_0.txt
that Morris did not commit suicide. This,91592_0.txt
"proof, to her, was equivalent to$ 5000, as",91592_0.txt
Brown said that the policy was made out,91592_0.txt

The girl's testimony presented both,91592_0.txt
Brown and Reilly in a bad light and they,91592_0.txt
were brought before the jury to explain,91592_0.txt
their position. They stated that the insurance,91592_0.txt

McReynolds was the murderer and was,91592_0.txt

tated the action of the authorities. West-,91592_0.txt
ley McReynolds and his brother Albert,91592_0.txt
were arrested and housed in the County,91592_0.txt
Jail ahead of the time the mob assembled,91592_0.txt
to lynch them. Now Westley McReynolds,91592_0.txt
lies back in his dark cell and actually,91592_0.txt
laughs. He seems to be easy of feeling,91592_0.txt
and does not show any dread of the remade,91592_0.txt
sults of the terrible accusation,91592_0.txt
against him. Westley depends chiefly for,91592_0.txt
an acquittal on the testimony of the Ward,91592_0.txt
family. He claims that he was heard to,91592_0.txt
cough by them some time about the hour,91592_0.txt
when the murder was committed. If this,91592_0.txt
is the only alibi the accused can present,91592_0.txt
there is every likelihood that the detec-,91592_0.txt
will hang him.,91592_0.txt
"tives The"" cough"" alibi was started some days",91592_0.txt
ago. Detective Reilly suggested it himself,91592_0.txt
"to one of Westley McReynolds' friends,",91592_0.txt
"saying:"" I hear that the Wards for whom",91592_0.txt
Westley worked heard him coughing in,91592_0.txt
"bed the night of the murder, but I don't",91592_0.txt
"believe it."" That was the bait Westley",91592_0.txt
"McReynolds heard, and he swallowed it",91592_0.txt
Since that time he is depending on that,91592_0.txt
alibi. The Wards deny they saw Westley,91592_0.txt
that night. There is a wonderful revulsion,91592_0.txt
of feeling in regard to the accused,91592_0.txt
men since the methods of the private detectives,91592_0.txt
to obtain their conviction have,91592_0.txt
been bruited. It is now believed that even,91592_0.txt
if indictments are found a conviction cannot,91592_0.txt
follow on account of the lack of evidence,91592_0.txt
. The situation is so very different,91592_0.txt

There is a quarrel that has started among,91592_0.txt

It seems that at the time of the arrest the,91592_0.txt
telephone wires of Calaveras and Tuolumne,91592_0.txt
counties were kept hot by somebody calling,91592_0.txt
"up Goorge Morris' friends, telling them",91592_0.txt
of the cold- blooded murder and urging the,91592_0.txt
speedy lynching of the suspected. This,91592_0.txt
"was an appeal of great significance, the deceased",91592_0.txt
standing not only as a very popular,91592_0.txt
"man among the masses, but as a prominent",91592_0.txt
member of the Knights of Pythias and of,91592_0.txt
"the Foresters, representing a force of 213",91592_0.txt
friends and brothers in the county. The,91592_0.txt
telephone agencies in the various townships,91592_0.txt

is known to everybody and no one,91592_0.txt

"and curious things were afloat, and if the credulous",91608_0.txt
"and superstitious did not see what they wanted, they",91608_0.txt
had only to ask for it. Then the Civil War came on,91608_0.txt
and in the potency of its passion and its intense and,91608_0.txt
mighty call to the people all things else were burned,91608_0.txt
as by fire and no sound was heard but that of the,91608_0.txt
great trumpet that called the sons of the republic,91608_0.txt
to exertion and fidelity unto death.,91608_0.txt
Since then another generation has arisen and another,91608_0.txt
is coming with manhood just thickening its,91608_0.txt
neck. The old disposition to take up a fad is still,91608_0.txt
upon man. But unfortunately the fad now seems to,91608_0.txt
"be lynching. Men and women are lynched, and what",91608_0.txt
"is supposed to be justice is administered, al frseco,",91608_0.txt
while the dust gathers on the Judge's desk and in,91608_0.txt
"the jury box of the criminal courts, for their place",91608_0.txt
is usurped and their function assumed by the mob.,91608_0.txt
The savagery of the fad is progressive. At first the,91608_0.txt
victims were hanged. Then soon it was the rule to,91608_0.txt
riddle their dead and pendent bodies with bullets.,91608_0.txt
Then they were shot full of lead as they were strung,91608_0.txt
"up. Next a mob of artists in lynching, having shot",91608_0.txt
"and hanged a man, cut his body down and burned",91608_0.txt
"it. The next step was a short one, and was taken,",91608_0.txt
"we believe, in Texas, where the victim was caught,",91608_0.txt
"condemned, pinioned and burned alive, tied to a stake.",91608_0.txt
Observers believed that this marked the high tide,91608_0.txt
of the fad and that the horror of it would have a,91608_0.txt
repellent effect and that the horror of it would have a,91608_0.txt
decline and disappear. But they were mistaken. The,91608_0.txt
horror of the stake became a fascination. It seemed,91608_0.txt
to fittingly express the spirit of revenge roused by the,91608_0.txt
"vile nature of the crime which it expiated, and in several",91608_0.txt
instances it has been used to punish offenses of,91608_0.txt
less enormity.,91608_0.txt
This horrible fad is not confined to any section.,91608_0.txt
In all divisions of the States it is rampant. The South,91608_0.txt
"has furnished the greatest number of cases, but they",91608_0.txt
do not differ in kind from those that have occurred,91608_0.txt
"in Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming, Indiana, Illinois and",91608_0.txt
other States. In the dispatches of one day recently a,91608_0.txt
"rope was being knotted for a negro woman, in South",91608_0.txt
"Carolina, who beheaded her children and burned their",91608_0.txt
"bodies, negroes being the intended avengers. A Mis-",91608_0.txt
souri Sheriff was standing off a mob that desired to,91608_0.txt
lynch a loafer for shooting an officer. A Delaware,91608_0.txt
mob was in hot pursuit of a negro to burn him for,91608_0.txt
shooting a constable. Minnesota lynchers were in,91608_0.txt
"pursuit of a wretch guilty of an unspeakable crime,",91608_0.txt
and the same cause moved another party in Ohio.,91608_0.txt
But the oddest of all that day's doings appeared in,91608_0.txt
Georgia. A penitentiary Warden was the threatened,91608_0.txt
"victim. Among his prisoners is a white woman, a",91608_0.txt
"Miss Crist, known as"" the Diamond Queen,"" born",91608_0.txt
"of a good family, and believed to be insane. The",91608_0.txt
"Warden's name is Alagood, and he ordered Miss",91608_0.txt
"Crist, though a delicate woman, to work as a fieldhand",91608_0.txt
"with the negro prisoners, incited thereto by his wife.",91608_0.txt
"Now Mrs. Alagood's methods seem to belie her name,",91608_0.txt
since they were a la bad. When Miss Crist protested,91608_0.txt
against assignment to field work Mrs. Alagood ordered,91608_0.txt
her husband to have her whipped. Thereupon,91608_0.txt
"the frail white woman was taken to the torture- room,",91608_0.txt
tied up and given forty lashes on the bare back by,91608_0.txt
the Warden. The thongs cut to the ribs and left,91608_0.txt
gashes in her breast. No male prisoner had ever received,91608_0.txt
"more than ten lashes, but the Warden's wife",91608_0.txt
is thorough in what she undertakes. At once Georgia,91608_0.txt
was on fire and immediately it was proposed to lynch,91608_0.txt
the Warden. He made Adam's excuse that his wife,91608_0.txt
"ordered it, and the Governor proceeded to investigate",91608_0.txt
. But the Alagoods don't show themselves in,91608_0.txt
public and the masks and rope are ready if the,91608_0.txt
Warden is caught. the,91608_0.txt
Thompson appeared with his new school of medicine,91608_0.txt

negroes had formed a plan to murder,91626_1.txt
all the white men in the county; that a,91626_1.txt

ible on its face that the RECORD UNION at,91626_1.txt
"once pronounced it a fiction, and expressed",91626_1.txt

it had been the practice of certain Bourbon,91626_1.txt

that he was one of the mob that strung,91672_0.txt
the old negro to tree after slashing,91672_0.txt
his throat with a razor. He also gave,91672_0.txt
the police the name of four or five of,91672_0.txt

married to a white woman. Raymer denies,91672_0.txt
any part in the actual lynching.,91672_0.txt

those who placed the rope around the,91672_0.txt
old man's neck. At 3 o'clock Friday,91672_0.txt
morning Raymer was one of the foremost,91672_0.txt
of the crowd that lynched Scott,91672_0.txt

thought that too much consideration,91679_0.txt

officials and,91681_0.txt
helped,91681_0.txt
to the,91681_0.txt
them to destroy it. Wiseman,91681_0.txt
and Snipes suspected Isaac Osborne as,91681_0.txt
the reporter. On the night of August,91681_0.txt

he selected 20 of the most determined,91681_0.txt

men the county to assist him in,91681_0.txt
the prisoner in his charge. A,91681_0.txt

disguised with white handkerchiefs across,91701_0.txt
"their faces, and entered the town along Cedar",91701_0.txt

MOB LAW AT THE SOUTH.,91703_0.txt
The lynching of negroes by Southern,91703_0.txt
mobs has become so ordinary an occurrence,91703_0.txt
"as scarcely to excite remark, but the",91703_0.txt
phenomenon ne vertheless calls for the most,91703_0.txt
"energetic protest, and indicates an abnormal",91703_0.txt
state of society. In the States where,91703_0.txt
"it is most common, there is no pretense",91703_0.txt
that the machinery of justice is crippled,91703_0.txt
or corrupt. It has never been claimed,91703_0.txt
that summary and lawless modes of pun-,91703_0.txt
ent were had recourse to because the,91703_0.txt
conviction of criminals was uncertain. So,91703_0.txt
far as can be perceived negro criminals at,91703_0.txt
the South receive the full measure of their,91703_0.txt
offenses when they are brought before the,91703_0.txt
Courts. The only explanation of the passion,91703_0.txt
for lynching which has become so common,91703_0.txt
"is, that the Courts do not punish all",91703_0.txt
"offenses with death, while the lynchers",91703_0.txt
In other words these lynchings,91703_0.txt
do.,91703_0.txt
are at bottom neither more nor less,91703_0.txt
than systematic methods of terrcr-,91703_0.txt
izing the colored people by making,91703_0.txt
them believe that all their offenses,91703_0.txt
are to be regarded as capital. There have,91703_0.txt
been hundreds of foul murders committed,91703_0.txt
"by white men in the South, but unless the",91703_0.txt
murderer happened to be a Republican no,91703_0.txt
thought of lynching has ever arisen because,91703_0.txt
them. When Colonel Tom Buford,91703_0.txt
of,91703_0.txt
assassinated Judge Elliott because the latter,91703_0.txt
"had decided a civil suit against him,",91703_0.txt
the scoundrel was sympathized with and,91703_0.txt
pitied. Had he been a negro it cannot be,91703_0.txt
doubted that all the country would have,91703_0.txt
turned out to hang him summarily. In,91703_0.txt
Mississippi two other villainous white men,91703_0.txt
have just been acquitted on the charge of,91703_0.txt
murdering a man during the Chisholm,91703_0.txt
"massacre. Nobody doubts their guilt,",91703_0.txt
but no white Mississippi jury can be got to,91703_0.txt
other,91703_0.txt
convict them white,91703_0.txt
or any,91703_0.txt
therefore perfectly,91703_0.txt
assassins,91703_0.txt
It is,91703_0.txt
.,91703_0.txt
clear that Southern lynchings have no,91703_0.txt
connection with regard for order and abhorrence,91703_0.txt
of crime. They are rather evidences,91703_0.txt
of the chronic defiance of law and,91703_0.txt
order which the Southern whites,91703_0.txt
themselves upon wherever their colored pride,91703_0.txt
fellow- citizens are concerned. They,91703_0.txt
lynching parties as they organize red-,91703_0.txt

well- understood general policy to keep,91703_0.txt
"down the negroes, and lynching is specially",91703_0.txt
favored because it affords a pretext for,91703_0.txt

out. The leader backed down and the mob,8173_0.txt
hissed. Then a twenty- foot plank was,8173_0.txt
brought up and shoved into the room clearing,8173_0.txt
"it of its occupants, who retreated",8173_0.txt
into the hall. Again the old man stood up,8173_0.txt
"and was cheered. This time be went in, followed",8173_0.txt
"by the mob, who crawled through the",8173_0.txt
"little aperature as fast as possible, while the",8173_0.txt
crowd swarmed up like a pack of hungry,8173_0.txt
wolves.,8173_0.txt
While this was going on Governor Boyd,8173_0.txt
endeavored to dissuade the mob from any,8173_0.txt
"acts of violence, but his council was opposed",8173_0.txt
"by Councilman Morearty, who shouted to the",8173_0.txt
crowd to come on and waved his cane and,8173_0.txt
hat frantically in the air. This sort of talk,8173_0.txt
was all the crowd wanted and they pushed,8173_0.txt
through the window as rapidly as possible.,8173_0.txt
Their Victim in Sight.,8173_0.txt
Once inside the crowd made short work of,8173_0.txt
the door opening from the office into the corridor,8173_0.txt
. The door opening into the large cell,8173_0.txt
on the lower floor was broken and the crowd,8173_0.txt
made its way upstairs to the room where,8173_0.txt
Neal spent the last hours of his life. The,8173_0.txt
door leading to this room was broken open,8173_0.txt
and the crowd surged into the room surrounding,8173_0.txt
"the steel cage, in one corner of",8173_0.txt
which crouched the miserable object of their,8173_0.txt
"search, a blanket wrapped around him and",8173_0.txt
endeavoring to conceal himself.,8173_0.txt
As those inside caught sight of the negro,8173_0.txt
"they set up a howl of delight, which was",8173_0.txt
quickly taken up by the crowd outside.,8173_0.txt
The police and jailers inside followed along,8173_0.txt
with the crowd but were utterly helpless.,8173_0.txt
The sight of the steel cage with its double,8173_0.txt
doors and strong bars did not daunt the attacking,8173_0.txt
party and demands for sledge hammers,8173_0.txt
", crowbars, cold chisels, etc., shouted",8173_0.txt
through the window met with quick response,8173_0.txt
from those outside and soon the,8173_0.txt
noise of resounding blows awakend the,8173_0.txt
echoes outside and were greeted with,8173_0.txt
cheers.,8173_0.txt
Shouting Bulletins.,8173_0.txt
A young fellow took post in the window,8173_0.txt
"and at once established a series of bulletins,",8173_0.txt
shouting to the crowd below as the work,8173_0.txt
progressed. At short intervals he shouted,8173_0.txt
out such items as:,8173_0.txt
""" They are working on the door;"""" The",8173_0.txt
"door is giving way;"""" The nigger is praying",8173_0.txt
";"" We're getting there slow, but sure:""",8173_0.txt
""" The outside door is open;"""" They have to",8173_0.txt
"cut a four- inch bar on the second door;""",8173_0.txt
""" The nigger says he is a burglar;"""" The",8173_0.txt
"niggor is taking it easier than we are,"" and",8173_0.txt
"so on, each sally being greeted with howls",8173_0.txt
and cheers.,8173_0.txt
Police Were Not in It.,8173_0.txt
Meanwhile about a dozen policemen stood,8173_0.txt
"about in the crowd, but they were utterly",8173_0.txt
helpless and did not attempt to do anything.,8173_0.txt
The crowd was constantly receiving accessions,8173_0.txt
", and by this time there were about",8173_0.txt
"10,000 people collected. The hill about the",8173_0.txt
"jail was literally black with people, and Har-",8173_0.txt
ney street from Eighteenth to Sixteenth was,8173_0.txt
"filled with a howling, surging mob. It was a",8173_0.txt
"good- natured mob, however, but it was determined",8173_0.txt
to carry its point. The several,8173_0.txt
policemen in the crowd suddenly conceived,8173_0.txt
the idea of forcing their way to the open window,8173_0.txt
and proceeded to put the idea into effect.,8173_0.txt
They had not gone raore than a few feet,8173_0.txt
when the crowd saw their obiect and the policemen,8173_0.txt
were picked up bodily and carried,8173_0.txt
back to the edge of the crowd.,8173_0.txt
Brought the Firemen.,8173_0.txt
About this time the attention of the crowd,8173_0.txt
was attracted by the noise of heavy wheels,8173_0.txt
and four companies of the fire department,8173_0.txt
arrived on the scene. A connection was,8173_0.txt
made by one of the companies,8173_0.txt
with the hydrant at Eighteenth and,8173_0.txt
and the,8173_0.txt
"Haruey streets, water was",8173_0.txt
turned on. In less than two seconds there,8173_0.txt
twenty fountains spouting in the middle of,8173_0.txt
Harney street and several feet of new hose,8173_0.txt
was ruined by being cut. Other companies,8173_0.txt
"tried to lay lines of hose, but the crowd just",8173_0.txt
picked the hose up as fast as it was strung,8173_0.txt
and carried it into the alley between Farnam,8173_0.txt
"and Harney streets, where it was uncoupled.",8173_0.txt
Seeing all attempts to turn the hose on the,8173_0.txt
"crowd were useless, the firemen were withdrawn",8173_0.txt
.,8173_0.txt
While all this was going on the entire day,8173_0.txt
police force was massed at the north door of,8173_0.txt
the jail under command of Chief Seavey. The,8173_0.txt
object of the chief was to attempt to take the,8173_0.txt
negro from the crowd after they came out,8173_0.txt
of the jail.,8173_0.txt
Captain Cormack's Speech.,8173_0.txt
Becoming impatient at the slow work on,8173_0.txt
"the window, a part of the crowd, under the",8173_0.txt
"leadership of a big, burly red faced man.",8173_0.txt
swarmed around to the south door of the,8173_0.txt
building and up the steps to the entrance to,8173_0.txt
the sheriff's house.,8173_0.txt
""" We'll get in here,"" cried the leader of this",8173_0.txt
"gang, and he pounded on the door.",8173_0.txt
Captain Cormack stood inside and opened,8173_0.txt
the door.,8173_0.txt
""" What do you want?"" asked Cormack.",8173_0.txt
""" We want to get in,"" yelled the crowd in",8173_0.txt
concert. The captain throw a big six shooter,8173_0.txt
up into the face of the leader and said:,8173_0.txt
""" Get out of here. If you make another",8173_0.txt
"move to get in this door I will kill you.""",8173_0.txt
"That kind of talk, coming from a man of",8173_0.txt
Cormack's caliber and backed by his reputation,8173_0.txt
"as a man of nerve and a dead shot, was",8173_0.txt
"too much for the crowd, so they swarmed",8173_0.txt
back and joined the mob on the lawn.,8173_0.txt
"At the norta side, between the",8173_0.txt
jail the,8173_0.txt
and court house people,8173_0.txt
were packed in like sardines,8173_0.txt
in a box. The blows of the hammer on the,8173_0.txt
steel cell recently occupied by Neal came,8173_0.txt
floating out through the window and nearly,8173_0.txt
every blow was greeted by a cheer.,8173_0.txt
Read the Riot Act.,8173_0.txt
"About 10:30 Chief Seavey, accompanied by",8173_0.txt
"a sergeant of police, pushed his way through",8173_0.txt
the crowds to the northeast corner of the,8173_0.txt
"jail, where several men had mounted upon",8173_0.txt
ladders placed against the barred windows.,8173_0.txt
Pulling the men from the ladder the chief,8173_0.txt
turned to the crowd and in a loud tone of,8173_0.txt
voice exclaimed:,8173_0.txt
""" In the name of the state of Nebraska I",8173_0.txt
hereby command you to disperse to your,8173_0.txt
"several homes.""",8173_0.txt
The command was received with mingled,8173_0.txt
cheers and yells of derision. Mounting the,8173_0.txt
ladder Chief Seavey finally managed to make,8173_0.txt
himself heard above the uproar. He said:,8173_0.txt
""" Gentleman- The little girl who was injured",8173_0.txt
and reported dead by the papers this,8173_0.txt
"afternoon is still alive and doing well.""",8173_0.txt
"That was all the chief managed to say, for",8173_0.txt
his voice was once more drowned in the balel,8173_0.txt
of sounds.,8173_0.txt
"They Made the Run,",8173_0.txt
At twenty- five minutes past 12 the leaders,8173_0.txt
of the mob called to the crowd to give them,8173_0.txt
room to get out of the window of the jail,8173_0.txt
office. With a blood curdling yell the crowd,8173_0.txt
gave way for the leaders and the doomed,8173_0.txt
Several men out of,8173_0.txt
man. sprang,8173_0.txt
the window with the in,8173_0.txt
rope,8173_0.txt
"their hands, others shoved the half",8173_0.txt
dead brute out of the window and then the,8173_0.txt
most fearful work ever witnessed at the,8173_0.txt
hands of a mob in Omaha was performed,8173_0.txt
amid the piercing yells of thousands of desperate,8173_0.txt
men.,8173_0.txt
No Pity for the Brute.,8173_0.txt
The rope was grasped by fully a hundred,8173_0.txt
men and they ran down the declining roadway,8173_0.txt
to the corner of Seventeenth and,8173_0.txt
Harney streets. The black brute was,8173_0.txt
dragged by the neck all the way,8173_0.txt
and must have been nearly dead,8173_0.txt
before he had been dragged 100 feet. The,8173_0.txt
"mob rushed upon him, kicking and jumping",8173_0.txt
upon him as he was jerked down over the,8173_0.txt
"rough pavement, his clothing being almost",8173_0.txt
"entirely torn from his body, and the skin",8173_0.txt
and flesh bruised and bleeding in a shocking,8173_0.txt
manner.,8173_0.txt
It is about seventy yards from the jail,8173_0.txt
window to the corner of the court house,8173_0.txt
square. This run of death was made in less,8173_0.txt
time than it takes to tell it.,8173_0.txt
Policemen Struggle with the Mob.,8173_0.txt
The officers struggled manfully to save the,8173_0.txt
"doomed man, but they were absolutely helpless",8173_0.txt
"in the midst of the yelling, frenzied",8173_0.txt
crowd of determined men.,8173_0.txt
The leaders in the rope brigade made for a,8173_0.txt
telegraph pole at the southwest corner of,8173_0.txt
"Harney and Seventeenth, but when one of",8173_0.txt
the lynchers had climed up the pole he found,8173_0.txt
"no projection to throw the rope across, and he",8173_0.txt
quickly descended and led the way to,8173_0.txt
a pole that stands diagonally across the,8173_0.txt
"street, directly north and across the street",8173_0.txt
from Boyd's theatre. It required at lea t,8173_0.txt
five minutes for those who had the man in,8173_0.txt
hand to get across the street.,8173_0.txt
A determined effort was made by the,8173_0.txt
police to rescue Coe. A back had,8173_0.txt
been driven through the crowd and,8173_0.txt
stopped near the corner of the street.,8173_0.txt
Toward this hack the police officers made a,8173_0.txt
rush with the doomed man and a few of the,8173_0.txt
leaders of the mob.,8173_0.txt
All Efforts to Save Him Vain.,8173_0.txt
The struggle was that of giants. The,8173_0.txt
officers had the good sense not to draw their,8173_0.txt
clubs or revolvers. If they had there would,8173_0.txt
have been terrible bloodshed. They succeeded,8173_0.txt
in getting the culprit into a,8173_0.txt
"hack, but the horses were quickly unhitched",8173_0.txt
and the officers overpowered.,8173_0.txt
Again the mob was in possession of the,8173_0.txt
doomed man. But the officers made one more,8173_0.txt
determined effort to save the almost dead,8173_0.txt
man from the hands of the mob. They,8173_0.txt
"rushed toward another hack, but the crowd",8173_0.txt
turned it upside down and actually smashed,8173_0.txt
it to pieces.,8173_0.txt
"Then the leaders, who had hold of the rope,",8173_0.txt
made a rush for the northeast corner of the,8173_0.txt
street dragging the dead and mutilated body,8173_0.txt
after them.,8173_0.txt
One of the lynchers climbed up the pole,8173_0.txt
and threw the rope over several telephone,8173_0.txt
wires that stretch along Harney street.,8173_0.txt
Dangling in the Air.,8173_0.txt
Soon the end of the rope was returned to,8173_0.txt
the mob below and in the twinkling of an,8173_0.txt
eye the body of the black villain was dangling,8173_0.txt
"in the air as limp and lifeless, apparently, as",8173_0.txt
a rag.,8173_0.txt
The muscles of one arm twitched convulsively,8173_0.txt
", but aside from that not a sign of life",8173_0.txt
appeared to be left in the body.,8173_0.txt
Expressed Their Satisfaction in Yells.,8173_0.txt
Then such a yell! It sounded like the,8173_0.txt
chorus that arises from the camp of a band,8173_0.txt
of Indians engaged in a war dance. The,8173_0.txt
great crowd filled the street for,8173_0.txt
full block in direction,8173_0.txt
a every,8173_0.txt
and thousands stood in the court house campus,8173_0.txt
gazing upon the last dreadful scene in,8173_0.txt
the tragedy. No tragedy ever to be enacted,8173_0.txt
in the theatre just across the street will,8173_0.txt
thrill an audience with horror as did that,8173_0.txt
spectacle.,8173_0.txt
Swinging Limp and Lifeless.,8173_0.txt
"Beneath the dangling body stood the mob,",8173_0.txt
looking up at the object of their fearful revenge,8173_0.txt
", their faces gleaming in the electric",8173_0.txt
light and their voices filling the air with the,8173_0.txt
cries of a vengeance fully satisfied.,8173_0.txt
From a distance the body looked so limp,8173_0.txt
and lifeless that many supposed it was a,8173_0.txt
dunimy.,8173_0.txt
""" That don't go! that don't go!"" they",8173_0.txt
shouted; but the leaders who stood close to,8173_0.txt
the corpse that swung above their heads assured,8173_0.txt
the crowd that it was a nigger all,8173_0.txt
"right."" And then the air was rent with a",8173_0.txt
chorus of horrible yells.,8173_0.txt
Made Sure it Was the Negro.,8173_0.txt
A street car stood on the track near by and,8173_0.txt
several men climbed upon that to make sure,8173_0.txt
that the object suspended in the air was the,8173_0.txt
body of the negre. Gradually the crowd become,8173_0.txt
convinced that the deed had really been,8173_0.txt
"accomplished, the object of their wrath was",8173_0.txt
dead.,8173_0.txt
The doomea man was swung into the air,8173_0.txt
at exactly twenty- five minutes to 1 o'clock.,8173_0.txt
Held by the Horror.,8173_0.txt
Whue the majority of the great crowd,8173_0.txt
"quietly left for their homes fully 1,000 persons",8173_0.txt
remained and completely blocked the,8173_0.txt
streets and sidewalks near the dead man ..,8173_0.txt
Some one standing on the pavement directly,8173_0.txt
under the corpse called for a speech.,8173_0.txt
Julius S. Cooley was spotted first and compelled,8173_0.txt
by the hoots and cries to make a talk.,8173_0.txt
Cooley didn't say much of anything beyond,8173_0.txt
showing the great saving to the county by,8173_0.txt
"such actions, and advocated the laws of",8173_0.txt
Judge Lynch on account of celerity and,8173_0.txt
economy.,8173_0.txt
Just then some one saw Governor Boyd,8173_0.txt
"stepping into his carriage, in front of the",8173_0.txt
"opera house, and immediately there went up",8173_0.txt
a great howl Boyd. The carriage of the,8173_0.txt
governor kept for right on going though and in,8173_0.txt
a moment disappearad around the corner of,8173_0.txt
Seventeenth and Farnam.,8173_0.txt
Then George O'Brien hove in sight and,8173_0.txt
was urged to speak. Taking off his hat and,8173_0.txt
standing on the edge of the sidewalk,8173_0.txt
O'Brien addressed the crowd. He said:,8173_0.txt
""" Of course public sentiment will frown",8173_0.txt
upon such action as this as long as there are,8173_0.txt
laws. I don't think there is a married man,8173_0.txt
"or woman, a sister, brother, father or mother",8173_0.txt
in the whole city of Omaha that will not,8173_0.txt
commend your action of tonight and say that,8173_0.txt
"you all did right.""",8173_0.txt
Then the Coroner Came.,8173_0.txt
Just the n Coroner Harrigan drove up and,8173_0.txt
viewed the body. Everybody yelled for,8173_0.txt
"Harrigan, and the doctor, standing beneath",8173_0.txt
"the dangling corpse in the flickering light,",8173_0.txt
said:,8173_0.txt
""" What is done is done; actions speak",8173_0.txt
"louder than words.""",8173_0.txt
Heafy& Heafy's undertaking wagon drove,8173_0.txt
up as the coroner ceased speaking and was,8173_0.txt
greeted with cheers. Some cried:,8173_0.txt
""" Let him hang, d- n him, it was a good",8173_0.txt
"job.""",8173_0.txt
Amid such remarks the body was quickly,8173_0.txt
"lowered into the box, after having hung just",8173_0.txt
"one hour, and with one final hurrah the",8173_0.txt
wagon drove away down Farnam street on a,8173_0.txt
gallop.,8173_0.txt
At 2 o'clock this morning Coroner Horri-,8173_0.txt
gan viewed the remains of Coe as they lay in,8173_0.txt
the undertaking rooms at Heafey's. He,8173_0.txt
stated that the man's neck was broken and,8173_0.txt
that life was extinct when the body was cut,8173_0.txt
down. The inquest will be held at 3 o'clock,8173_0.txt
this afternoon.,8173_0.txt
In the Midst of the Mob.,8173_0.txt
The crush and press of the crowd was,8173_0.txt
something fearful as it swayed back and,8173_0.txt
forth. After Coe was brought down to the,8173_0.txt
jail office and while the crowd was waiting,8173_0.txt
for those who knew him to,8173_0.txt
"make sure of his identification, the",8173_0.txt
crowd made a clear path several times half,8173_0.txt
way down to the street near Boyd's opera,8173_0.txt
house by the stalwarts catching hands in a,8173_0.txt
line and holding the others back. But the,8173_0.txt
press of thousands behind soon broke,8173_0.txt
the bulwark of arms and hands and,8173_0.txt
the ranks woud close again with a rush.,8173_0.txt
Boys and weakly men were in danger,8173_0.txt
of being crowded to death. Crowbars and,8173_0.txt
sledgehammers were handed in over the,8173_0.txt
heads of the crowd until it seemed that,8173_0.txt
there must have been a wagon load of them,8173_0.txt
on the inside. When it was announced,8173_0.txt
that the culprit had been pulled from his cell,8173_0.txt
the crowd fairly split the air with their,8173_0.txt
yells.,8173_0.txt
""" Hang him, hang hin"" was the cry.""",8173_0.txt
Police officers were absolutely powerless in,8173_0.txt
the crowd.,8173_0.txt
Sheriff Boyd Missing.,8173_0.txt
After Sheriff Boyd had concluded his,8173_0.txt
speech at the jail window he suddenly disappeared,8173_0.txt
and was not seen by parties around,8173_0.txt
the jail until after Coe was dead.,8173_0.txt
People wondered why such was,8173_0.txt
"the case, but it is easily explained",8173_0.txt
", as the sheriff was abducted.",8173_0.txt
He hastily made his way to the north door of,8173_0.txt
"the jail, and at once passed out, Hardly had",8173_0.txt
he stepped upon the pavement before he was,8173_0.txt
surrounded by a score of masked men. The,8173_0.txt
sheriff reached for his revolver and was in,8173_0.txt
"the act of drawing it from his pocket,",8173_0.txt
when his arms were pinioned from behind.,8173_0.txt
He was lifted up bodily and carried down the,8173_0.txt
"stone driveway, and then walked to the rear",8173_0.txt
"of the High school building, where he was",8173_0.txt
kept a prisoner until 1 o'clock this morning.,8173_0.txt
"The sheriff, in speaking of the incident,",8173_0.txt
"stated that, owing to the masks that the",8173_0.txt
"men wore, he was unable to recognize",8173_0.txt
any of them. While he was held a prisoner,8173_0.txt
he was fully informed of how things were,8173_0.txt
"going on at the jail, as his captors were well",8173_0.txt
"organized, having a number of couriers who",8173_0.txt
traveled back and forth between the two,8173_0.txt
points.,8173_0.txt
Judge Doane Pleaded for Order.,8173_0.txt
At 10:45 Judge Doane appeared upon the,8173_0.txt
scene. He crowded his way through the,8173_0.txt
mob until he reached a point midway between,8173_0.txt
the steps at the south of the court,8173_0.txt
house and the jail. Then he stopped and in,8173_0.txt
a loud clear tone of voice that was,8173_0.txt
heard above the din of sledge hammer blows,8173_0.txt
that were being deait upon the cage in which,8173_0.txt
"Coe was confined, peaded with the mob to",8173_0.txt
use reason and proceed slowly. He urged,8173_0.txt
that the law should be allowed,8173_0.txt
to take its course and that justice,8173_0.txt
would be meted out. The mob,8173_0.txt
"listened, but only for an instant. Again the",8173_0.txt
"sledge hammer blows were renewed, while",8173_0.txt
the judge crowded his way through the mob,8173_0.txt
and succeeded in gaining entrance to the,8173_0.txt
main corridor. There he stopped and pleaded,8173_0.txt
with those inside.,8173_0.txt
"As he was talking, Coe, more dead than",8173_0.txt
alive was drawn down the long corridor and,8173_0.txt
into the office. Once more Judge Doane,8173_0.txt
lifted his voice in pleading for the colored,8173_0.txt
"man's life, but it was too late, as before",8173_0.txt
he had concluded his remarks,8173_0.txt
Coe was pushed through the window and,8173_0.txt
was being dragged down over the cruel,8173_0.txt
rocks in the direction of the southeast corner,8173_0.txt
of the court house grounds.,8173_0.txt
Coe Was Married.,8173_0.txt
"Coe, the man who was lynched by the mob,",8173_0.txt

from the jail there was a rush to,8173_0.txt
get out of the way of the men who,8173_0.txt
"were pulling the rope, that they might",8173_0.txt

of sheep the men ran down the grassy slopes,8173_0.txt
"of the court house grounds, over the retaining",8173_0.txt
walls and fell or jumped to the pavement,8173_0.txt

were everywhere conspicuous. They,8173_0.txt
stopped on the way home from their shopping,8173_0.txt

took as much interest in the proceedings as,8173_0.txt

INSIDE THE JAIL.,8173_0.txt
How the Sheriff and His Assistants,8173_0.txt
Sought to Save Coe.,8173_0.txt
Sheriff Boyd was in bed when the first,8173_0.txt
warning of trouble was received. It was,8173_0.txt
"about 8:30 o'clock, and the sheriff, worn out",8173_0.txt
with the exciting duties that had devolved,8173_0.txt
"upon him during the day, had just retired",8173_0.txt
when there was a ring at the telephone and,8173_0.txt
the sheriff was impatiently called for.,8173_0.txt
He responded and was told that trouble,8173_0.txt
was impending at the jail. He hastily,8173_0.txt
"dressed and hurried to the jail, wholly unconscious",8173_0.txt
"of what the trouble could be, as he",8173_0.txt
was not then aware that Smith had been,8173_0.txt
"removed from the city to the county jail, the",8173_0.txt
transfer having been made about 4 o'clock in,8173_0.txt
the afternoon.,8173_0.txt
When he reached the court house grounds,8173_0.txt
"he found fully 1,000 people gathered about",8173_0.txt
"the vicinity, many of them being close around",8173_0.txt
the jail. As soon as he was admitted to the,8173_0.txt
jail he demanded to know what was the matter,8173_0.txt
", and the situation was quickly made",8173_0.txt
known to him. Smith was then confined in,8173_0.txt
the upper tier of cages in the main cell,8173_0.txt
"room, where all the bound over",8173_0.txt
prisoners are kept. The sheriff ordered,8173_0.txt
him instantly removed to the,8173_0.txt
steel solitary in the east wing that for months,8173_0.txt
had been the abode of Ed Neal. As the negro,8173_0.txt

"At about 3:00 o'clock a. m., last Friday,",8188_0.txt
"Wm. Waters, a negro boy, aged a little over",8188_0.txt
"17, according to plans conceived by him the",8188_0.txt
"day before, arose from a hay mow on the",8188_0.txt

the horse near the depot at that place and proceeded,8188_0.txt
on foot to the general merchandise,8188_0.txt
store of Mr. E. F. Parker.,8188_0.txt
"Parker was a widower, with no children,",8188_0.txt
"and as had been his custom for many years,",8188_0.txt
was sleeping in a room in the rear of the,8188_0.txt
store when Waters walked up to the store,8188_0.txt
door and tried to awake him by rapping on,8188_0.txt
and shaking the door. Being unsuccessful in,8188_0.txt
"his attempt to arouse Mr. Parker in this way,",8188_0.txt
Waters went around to the side of the house,8188_0.txt
and tapped upon the window immediately,8188_0.txt
over the bed upon which Mr. Parker was,8188_0.txt
sleeping. Mr.Parker arose and demanded who,8188_0.txt
was there and what was wanted. Waters re-,8188_0.txt
"plied, giving his name and stating that he",8188_0.txt
wished to purchase some clothing. Parker,8188_0.txt
remarked to him that he had come quite early,8188_0.txt
to make his purchases and in order not to,8188_0.txt
arouse suspicion Waters said that it was,8188_0.txt
pretty early but he wanted to get the clothes,8188_0.txt
to wear to the Higginsville fair. Parker then,8188_0.txt
"slipped on his pants and slippers, opened the",8188_0.txt
"back door, and admitted the murderously- in-",8188_0.txt
clined negro.,8188_0.txt
A lamp was lighted and the negro and his,8188_0.txt
victim went into the store room. The first,8188_0.txt
article asked for by Waters was cigars and,8188_0.txt
"while Parker was getting them Waters, according",8188_0.txt
"to the statement made to his captors,",8188_0.txt
watched for a chance to strike him down with,8188_0.txt
acorn- knife which he had brought along,8188_0.txt
with him for the purpose of executing his,8188_0.txt
murderous plans.,8188_0.txt
The opportunity to strike did not present,8188_0.txt
itself while Parker was getting the cigars and,8188_0.txt
Waters deferred his bloody work until the,8188_0.txt
merchant began displaying his stock of clothing,8188_0.txt
.,8188_0.txt
Shirts were called for by Waters and a,8188_0.txt
"selection made, and Parker wrapped them up.",8188_0.txt
Pants were then called for and after several,8188_0.txt
pairs had been spread upon the counter the,8188_0.txt
opportunity for Waters to strike presented,8188_0.txt
itself. for Parker had turned to the shelying,8188_0.txt
and Waters was immediately behind him. He,8188_0.txt
raised his corn- knite and struck Parker in the,8188_0.txt
"top of the head, laying the scalo open for a",8188_0.txt
space beginning at the top of the forehead,8188_0.txt
"and extending back about four inches, and",8188_0.txt
penetrating the skull to the depth of about,8188_0.txt
one- twelfth of an inch. Parker turned and,8188_0.txt
"cried out to his murderer for mercy, but the",8188_0.txt
murderous work had been commenced and,8188_0.txt
had to be ended.,8188_0.txt
Another blow was struck. This time the,8188_0.txt
knife caught on a line which had been stretched,8188_0.txt
across the room for the purpose of hanging,8188_0.txt
"goods for display, and was diverted from",8188_0.txt
the place the murderer intended to strike but,8188_0.txt
",",8188_0.txt
one of the most ghastly of the many wounds,8188_0.txt
was inflicted by this stroke. The knife struck,8188_0.txt
Mr. Parker in the left corner of the mouth,8188_0.txt
and laid his face open back to the ear. This,8188_0.txt
stroke also cut the jaw bone entirely in two.,8188_0.txt
Mr. Parker then attempted to get,8188_0.txt
his murderer,8188_0.txt
away,8188_0.txt
from by going toward the front,8188_0.txt
window of the store and behind a large,8188_0.txt
"upright show case, but Waters jumped over",8188_0.txt
the counter and rushed to his victim.who had,8188_0.txt
"by this time fallen to the floor, and began",8188_0.txt
hacking him in the neck. The wounded man,8188_0.txt
was struggling and groaning and the negro,8188_0.txt
continued cutting him in the neck until all,8188_0.txt
groans were husbed and his victim lay per-,8188_0.txt
"fectly still. These last strokes, added to the",8188_0.txt
ones made while the victim was standing.,8188_0.txt
made the sight that met the eyes of those who,8188_0.txt
saw the body before its removal from the,8188_0.txt
"place where found, one of the most ghastly",8188_0.txt
ever witnessed. The poor man's,8188_0.txt
head was,8188_0.txt
"nearly severed from his shoulders, and was",8188_0.txt
left hanging thereon by only a few muscles,8188_0.txt
and very little flesh.,8188_0.txt
He then began his search for money. One,8188_0.txt
pocket in the murdered man's pants was,8188_0.txt
"turned inside out, but no money found therein",8188_0.txt
. The other pocket which was on the side,8188_0.txt
"next to the floor and in the blood, contained",8188_0.txt
"87 60 in silver, but was not molested. Waters",8188_0.txt
then took his corn- knife and pried open the,8188_0.txt
"cash drawer, but found no money.",8188_0.txt
"He then heard a noise without, picked up",8188_0.txt
the bundle of shirts and a few other things.,8188_0.txt
blew out the lamp and fled. He went directly,8188_0.txt
"to Mr. Sheir's farm, ste his breakfast, and,",8188_0.txt
in company with the latter named gentleman,8188_0.txt
came to a place near this city for two loads of,8188_0.txt
corn.,8188_0.txt
Mr. Parker's store is on the main street of,8188_0.txt
Mayview. About 100 yards east of the store,8188_0.txt
"is the home of J. P. Maw, where Parker ate",8188_0.txt
his meals. At 6 o'clock Mr. Maw went to the,8188_0.txt
store as was his wont to call Parker to break,8188_0.txt
"fast. He found the door locked, and thinking",8188_0.txt
Parker was still asleep did not try to wake,8188_0.txt
him. Half an hour later Maw returned and,8188_0.txt
still found the store locked. He shook the,8188_0.txt
"door several times, but getting no answer",8188_0.txt
went to the rear door opening into Parker's,8188_0.txt
"bedroom, intending to knock on that and so",8188_0.txt
arouse him.,8188_0.txt
This rear door Maw found standing wide,8188_0.txt
open and he stepped into the room. He found,8188_0.txt
this disarranged and Parker's coat and vest,8188_0.txt
hanging from the back of chair,8188_0.txt
a The door,8188_0.txt
.,8188_0.txt
leading into the store was open and thinking,8188_0.txt
Parker was in there Maw stepped to the connecting,8188_0.txt
door to announce that breakfast was,8188_0.txt
ready. The shutters in front being tightly,8188_0.txt
closed the interior of the store was dark and,8188_0.txt
"Maw could see nothing. He lighted a match,",8188_0.txt
and holding it over his head peered into the,8188_0.txt
"room. Still he could not see the store keeper,",8188_0.txt
and he walked behind the counter in the west,8188_0.txt
side of the store. There under the flickering,8188_0.txt
blaze of his match the fearful sight met his,8188_0.txt
gaze,8188_0.txt
"Stretched on the floor, his feet toward the",8188_0.txt
"front, lay Parker's body in a pool of blood.",8188_0.txt

found it was still warm.but the wound show-,8188_0.txt

Maw quickly gave the alarm and in fifteen,8188_0.txt
minutes the little store and the street on either,8188_0.txt
side of it were filled with an excited crowd.,8188_0.txt

the shelves of goods as high as the ceiling,8188_0.txt
"were splashed with blood in a fearful manner,",8188_0.txt
The whole length of that side of the store,8188_0.txt
was literally painted with the life blood of,8188_0.txt
the dead man while on the floor under the,8188_0.txt
body and extending behind the feet to the,8188_0.txt
front window and back to the rear wall was,8188_0.txt
blood that had not yet had time to congeal.,8188_0.txt
On top of the show case on the counter immediately,8188_0.txt
above the body lay several boxes of,8188_0.txt
shirts and some tro users spread out Just as,8188_0.txt
the murdered man had laid them for the inspection,8188_0.txt
of the dastard who struck him,8188_0.txt
down.,8188_0.txt
The news of the tragedy spread rapidly for,8188_0.txt
Parker was a popular man and a rapid and systematic,8188_0.txt
investigation was begun for clews.,8188_0.txt
The fact that the body was still warm pointed,8188_0.txt
to a period about an hour or two previous as,8188_0.txt
the time of the murder or about or just preceding,8188_0.txt
daylight.,8188_0.txt
Inquiry was then made for any strangers,8188_0.txt
who might have been seen in the streets of,8188_0.txt
the village the night before and this method,8188_0.txt
"led to valuable developments. Alex Dyer, a",8188_0.txt
"colored man who lived back of Parker's store,",8188_0.txt
"stated that as he went to his back door, which",8188_0.txt
"opened in the alley, about 100 yards from the",8188_0.txt
"rear of l'arker's store, he saw a negro dart",8188_0.txt
across the alley back of the store and run in a,8188_0.txt
northwesterly direction to the road leading to,8188_0.txt
Lexington.,8188_0.txt
This evidence was speedily supplemented,8188_0.txt
"by that of Wm. Dyer, a brother, who had left",8188_0.txt
the house some few minutes before his brother,8188_0.txt
went to the back door. Will was going to,8188_0.txt
a job of work some distance away and his,8188_0.txt
road led him directly by the front of Parker's,8188_0.txt
store. As be passed he noticed it was open,8188_0.txt
and that lighted lamp stood the,8188_0.txt
a on counter,8188_0.txt
.,8188_0.txt
By its light he saw Mr. Parker back of the,8188_0.txt
counter reaching up to a shelf for something.,8188_0.txt
while in front of the counter stood a young,8188_0.txt
colored man be recognized as Will Waters.,8188_0.txt
He thought at the time it was strange for,8188_0.txt
Waters be in,8188_0.txt
to town at such an early hour,8188_0.txt
",",8188_0.txt
but made no inquiry.,8188_0.txt
"This much was learned by 9 o'clock, and a",8188_0.txt
party of men mounted and on foot at,8188_0.txt
", once",8188_0.txt
",",8188_0.txt
started for Shier's farm. They reached there,8188_0.txt
"in about half an hour, but neither Shier nor",8188_0.txt
the negro hand was there. Mrs. Shier stated,8188_0.txt
that they had gone to Lexington for corn.and,8188_0.txt
the party started in that direction,8188_0.txt
After,8188_0.txt
.,8188_0.txt
traveling about two miles they met Shier and,8188_0.txt
"the negro returning, each driving a wagon",8188_0.txt
load of corn.,8188_0.txt
Waters was told that he was wanted for the,8188_0.txt
"murder of Parker, but he stoutly protested",8188_0.txt
his innocence.,8188_0.txt
""" What's that blood on your hat and on",8188_0.txt
"your shirt,"" and one of his accusers pointed",8188_0.txt
to several bright red splashes on the front of,8188_0.txt
his straw hat and in the bosom of his shirt,8188_0.txt
just about the edge of his trousers.,8188_0.txt
"That's where I had the nose bleed,"" said",8188_0.txt
the and he manifested,8188_0.txt
negro still Ignorance,8188_0.txt
of the crime.,8188_0.txt
Shier was called on next and he told that,8188_0.txt
Waters had not been in the house all night.,8188_0.txt
He had come home early that morning on one,8188_0.txt
of his horses and when he scolded him for,8188_0.txt
Waters said that he had been over to May-,8188_0.txt
view to get some clothes he had bought the,8188_0.txt
night before.,8188_0.txt
The clothes were found in the barn at,8188_0.txt
Shler's farm by the party when they reached,8188_0.txt
there and were part of the same lot that lay,8188_0.txt
scattered about on top of the counter in the,8188_0.txt
murdered man's store and like them were,8188_0.txt
also splashed with blood.,8188_0.txt
"Still Waters protested his innocence, but",8188_0.txt
everything pointed so strongly to his guilt,8188_0.txt
that a halter was thrown over his head and,8188_0.txt
he was swung up to the limb of a tree in the,8188_0.txt
barnyard. The latter broke when his full,8188_0.txt
weight came upon it and the negro tell a limp,8188_0.txt
mass upon the ground.,8188_0.txt
The driving lines,8188_0.txt
were next detached from the harness of the,8188_0.txt
team Waters had been driving and quickly,8188_0.txt
fashioned into a noose and it was thrown over,8188_0.txt
his head and the crowd were about to swing,8188_0.txt
him up again.,8188_0.txt
Then Waters fell upon his knees and began,8188_0.txt
"bawling for merey."" I killed him, I killed",8188_0.txt
"him,"" he yelled,"" but please don't hang me,",8188_0.txt
"misters. I didn't mean to do it, but I wanted",8188_0.txt
"to get"" and the wretch lay groveling in",8188_0.txt
the dirt of the barnyard.,8188_0.txt
There was ong disposition on the part,8188_0.txt
"of the crowd to hang him then and there, but",8188_0.txt
cool counsel prevailed.,8188_0.txt
""" What did you kill Mr. Parker with?"" was",8188_0.txt
asked.,8188_0.txt
""" A corn knife,"" was the answer.and he led",8188_0.txt
his captors to a clump of weeds about a quarter,8188_0.txt
of a mile away and got the instrument of,8188_0.txt
butchery.,8188_0.txt
The crowd started toward Mayview with it,8188_0.txt
"and their prisoner, but half way there they",8188_0.txt
heard that officers from Lexington were,8188_0.txt
waiting for them to take the prisoner.,8188_0.txt
A decision was quickly reached and the,8188_0.txt
"party divided, one- half going back to May-",8188_0.txt

The party that went into town reported to,8188_0.txt
the authorities that Waters had escaped them,8188_0.txt
"and had probably gone to Lexington, where",8188_0.txt
"his parents lived, and the officers went to",8188_0.txt

Out in the patch of woods just off the,8188_0.txt
Chicago and Alton track and in plain sight of,8188_0.txt
"the village, the captors and their prisoner",8188_0.txt
spent the remainder of the day. The latter,8188_0.txt
was bound hand and foot.,8188_0.txt
I,8188_0.txt
Long before nightfall a confession,8188_0.txt
had been,8188_0.txt
"extracted from the wretch, who fully realized",8188_0.txt
the fearful fate that was impending for him.,8188_0.txt
"The confession, as it was afterward related",8188_0.txt
"by several of the captors, was as follows:",8188_0.txt
""" Yesterday, Thursday, I was at the Higgins-",8188_0.txt
ville fair. I met Mr. Parker. He had a big,8188_0.txt
roll of money and I felt like taking it away,8188_0.txt
"from him, but I would be caught. I thought",8188_0.txt
I could do it better by wailing until morning,8188_0.txt
when I could catch him in his store alone and,8188_0.txt
knock him down. So I went home and slept,8188_0.txt
in the hay mow in the barn. I guess it was,8188_0.txt
about 3 o'clock when I woke up.for the moon,8188_0.txt
was shining bright.,8188_0.txt
I went down to the,8188_0.txt
stable and bridled one of Shier's horses and,8188_0.txt
started for Mayview. In passing the corn,8188_0.txt
field near the house I got oil and went to a,8188_0.txt
"shock of corn where I had left my corn knife,",8188_0.txt
then I rode on to Mayview. I hitched my,8188_0.txt
horse to a tree just outside near the depot and,8188_0.txt
went to Parker's store. I knocked but nobody,8188_0.txt
answered and I walked around to the back,8188_0.txt
and knocked on the window. Mr. Parker,8188_0.txt
"said' Who's there' and I said, Bill Waters.'",8188_0.txt
"What do you want. Will,' said he and I says,",8188_0.txt
Want to get some shirts. Mr. Parker. All,8188_0.txt
"right, just walk around to the front and'",8188_0.txt
Ket up and let you in.' So I walks around and,8188_0.txt
"pretty soon he opened the door and says,",8188_0.txt
"Ain't you a little bit early, Will? I says",8188_0.txt
"Yes, sir. I am, but I wanted some shirts so",8188_0.txt
that I could go to the fair. What are you,8188_0.txt
"doing with that corn knife?' says he, pointing",8188_0.txt
to the knife. Q.' says 1. I've got a little job,8188_0.txt
"of cutting to do before I go to the farm, Then",8188_0.txt
"I asks him for some cigars, and he went",8188_0.txt
around to the case to get them and I followed,8188_0.txt
"him close, trying to get a chance to hit him,",8188_0.txt
but his face was toward me all the time. Next,8188_0.txt
he went around the back end of the store and,8188_0.txt
behind the counter on the other side where,8188_0.txt
the shirts and things were. He asked me,8188_0.txt
what kind I wanted and I pointed to some,8188_0.txt
checked ones and he turned around to reach,8188_0.txt
them. Then I struck him with the corn knife,8188_0.txt
straight across the top of the head. I was,8188_0.txt
higher than bim and reached,8188_0.txt
over,8188_0.txt
so my,8188_0.txt
knife went clear across the top of his head.,8188_0.txt
"He reached up his hands and said' O,' and",8188_0.txt
when I hit him again a shirt hanging on a,8188_0.txt
string over the counter kind of turned my,8188_0.txt
knite and it struck him on the side of the face,8188_0.txt
cutting a hole from the mouth to the ear. He,8188_0.txt
"says,"" O, Will, please don't.' and grabbed my",8188_0.txt
"knite. I felt kind of sorry for him then, for 1",8188_0.txt
didn't mean to cut him so but now I knew I,8188_0.txt
"must finish, so I jerked the knife away and",8188_0.txt
"bit him and he fell, Then I run to the from",8188_0.txt
"door, for a nigger had passed just a little",8188_0.txt
while before and I locked it and then went,8188_0.txt
behind Mr.,8188_0.txt
the counter. Parker lay groaning,8188_0.txt
and dying on the floor and I just chopped,8188_0.txt
away until he lay still and didn't groan no,8188_0.txt
more. Then went into his pocket. He bad,8188_0.txt
only pants and shirt on and when I pulled,8188_0.txt
out the pocket some keys fell out. There was,8188_0.txt
"no money. I didn't look in the other pocket,",8188_0.txt
but went to the drawer. It was locked up,8188_0.txt
"and I pried it off with my knife, but there",8188_0.txt
was no money in that either. then I,8188_0.txt
heard a noise outside and I waited Just a minute,8188_0.txt
"and started out the back way, first blowing out",8188_0.txt
"the lamp. I went to my horse, got on and",8188_0.txt
rode him home. The corn knife I threw into,8188_0.txt
"the weeds just before I got to the house, and",8188_0.txt
"after breakfast I went to work.""",8188_0.txt
"At 9 o'clock p. m., it being pretty certain",8188_0.txt
"all oflicers had left town, a large crowd went",8188_0.txt
to the place where Waters was held a prisoner,8188_0.txt
and arrangements were soon completed to,8188_0.txt
hang him. A rope was looped over his head,8188_0.txt
and one end of it thrown over a bracket on a,8188_0.txt
telegraph pole. Then haif- a- dozen or more,8188_0.txt
men caught hold of the rope and pulled the,8188_0.txt
murderer up about six feet off the ground.,8188_0.txt
The end of the rope was then tied to a fence,8188_0.txt
and Waters left to strangle to death.,8188_0.txt
His body was left hanging until about 1:30,8188_0.txt
"p. m. Saturday, when Waters' mother, Mary",8188_0.txt
"Waters, of this city, as good and hard working",8188_0.txt

place Sunday morning at the colored grave,8188_0.txt

There have been a number of conflicting,8188_0.txt
reports afloat as to what the parents of Waters,8188_0.txt
had said about plans for murderous expedition,8188_0.txt
tions he had arranged and told them of. A,8188_0.txt

it would have been found that someone else,8188_0.txt

son's age as seventeen years and seven months,8188_0.txt
and thought it quite improbable that one so,8188_0.txt
young could have conceived the idea of a murder,8188_0.txt
so atrocious. She said he had always been,8188_0.txt

THE WHITE CAP EPIDEMIC.,8207_0.txt
There are few States in the Union from,8207_0.txt
which reports have not lately come of outrages,8207_0.txt
of one sort and another perpetrated by men who,8207_0.txt
are described as White Caps. Even New-,8207_0.txt
York shares the humiliation of having bred a,8207_0.txt
gang of scoundrels who assumed that name or,8207_0.txt
"had it thrust upon them. In Ohio, crimes of",8207_0.txt
violence attributed to the same agency have,8207_0.txt
been so frequent and flagrant during the last,8207_0.txt
few weeks that Governor Foraker has been,8207_0.txt
obliged to give official consideration to the,8207_0.txt
ability of the militia to cope with the secret,8207_0.txt
"organization. An amazing tale, somewhat",8207_0.txt
"highly varnished perhaps, was recently telegraphed",8207_0.txt
over the country from Chicago at,8207_0.txt
the instance of a man who had succeeded in,8207_0.txt
escaping thither from the land of the Buckeyes,8207_0.txt
after confronting perils the recollection,8207_0.txt
of which made his teeth chatter. And this,8207_0.txt
picturesquely gruesome narrative seemed to,8207_0.txt
create the taste and set the standard for the,8207_0.txt
White Cap literature which is now flooding the,8207_0.txt
country. If this outburst of activity could be,8207_0.txt
accounted for only by the sudden and swift development,8207_0.txt
of a secret order having branches,8207_0.txt
"in nearly every State and Territory, and tens",8207_0.txt
of thousands of zealous members sworn to obey,8207_0.txt
"orders, ask no questions, hesitate at nothing",8207_0.txt
"and maintain the silence of the grave, there",8207_0.txt
would be ample excuse for a general feeling,8207_0.txt
of insecurity and many local alarms. But we,8207_0.txt
have not the least idea that this is what the,8207_0.txt
existing situation really means.,8207_0.txt
That there is an active organization of miscreants,8207_0.txt
pledged to secrecy and loosely united,8207_0.txt
by a lawless spirit and a more or less flexible,8207_0.txt
code of regulations nobody pretends to doubt.,8207_0.txt
Originally it was akin in character and purpose,8207_0.txt
to the Vigilance Committees of our old,8207_0.txt
frontiers. It bore some resemblance to the,8207_0.txt
"Ku Klux Klan, and may have been formed",8207_0.txt
from the more respectable relics of that infernal,8207_0.txt
order. Many of its early operations,8207_0.txt
"were inspired by honest motives, and had as",8207_0.txt
good grounds for justification as lynch law,8207_0.txt
ever has. But it is the inevitable fate of such,8207_0.txt
organizations to degenerate into pure wantonness,8207_0.txt
", and, that is now the characteristic badge",8207_0.txt
of the White Caps wheresoever they are found.,8207_0.txt
But it is a mistake to suppose that they have,8207_0.txt
any necessary connection with most of the outrages,8207_0.txt
"which have recently been committed, or",8207_0.txt
"reported, in their name.",8207_0.txt
"In the first place, it is not proved that any",8207_0.txt
such development of predatory and murderous,8207_0.txt
"instincts has actually occurred, as an unreflecting",8207_0.txt
perusal of the newspapers would lead the,8207_0.txt
reader to imagine. What is called an epidemic,8207_0.txt
"of some particular variety of crime- murder,",8207_0.txt
"arson, theft, infidelity, suicide, breach of trust",8207_0.txt
-is often merely or chiefly an epidemic of,8207_0.txt

OVER WILD BILL'S GRAVE.,8245_0.txt
Salutes Fired by Frontiersmen in Honor,8245_0.txt
of the Dead Shet's Memery.,8245_0.txt
There has been another red letter day,8245_0.txt
in the history of Deadwood. That was,8245_0.txt
the day on which Wild Bill was killed by,8245_0.txt
"McCaull. Though a popular man, Bill",8245_0.txt
"was a dead shot, and McCaull could not",8245_0.txt
have killed him if he had not approached,8245_0.txt
him treacherously. McCaull was imme-,8245_0.txt
"diately locked up, but the excitement became",8245_0.txt
so great that a mob assembled for,8245_0.txt
"the purpose of trying, convicting and",8245_0.txt
lynching him. While the proceedings,8245_0.txt
were in progress the clatter of hoofs was,8245_0.txt
heard and a man on horseback appeared,8245_0.txt
riding at full speed with his reins in his,8245_0.txt
teeth and with a rifle in one hand and an,8245_0.txt
Indian's dripping head in the other. He,8245_0.txt
had shot and killed the Indian just out,8245_0.txt
"side of Deadwood, and the event was",8245_0.txt
considered of so much importance that,8245_0.txt
the crowd forgot its lynching and proceeded,8245_0.txt
to gratify its thirst for vengeance,8245_0.txt
by contemplating the gory trophy which,8245_0.txt
rolled at its feet. McCaull was afterward,8245_0.txt
"taken to Yankton, where he was",8245_0.txt
hanged by the neck in a lawful manner.,8245_0.txt
Wild Bill was buried in the old cemetery,8245_0.txt
with a rude white board at his,8245_0.txt
"head, but five years later some of his",8245_0.txt
friends exhumed the body and gave it,8245_0.txt
proper burial in the new cemetery on,8245_0.txt
Mount Moriah. It was reported at that,8245_0.txt
time that Wild Bill's body had turned,8245_0.txt
"to stone, and a man came here not long",8245_0.txt
afterward and offered the undertaker,8245_0.txt
"$ 15,000 if he would help him steal it for",8245_0.txt
purposes of exhibition. Since then there,8245_0.txt
"have been many inquiries about the case,",8245_0.txt
but no one believes that the body was,8245_0.txt
petrified. Bill's new grave on the mount,8245_0.txt
ain top shows that it is the resort of,8245_0.txt
many curiosity seekers. A path is worn,8245_0.txt
across lots to it from the main wagon,8245_0.txt
"road road,, and and the the white white headboard headboard has has been been",8245_0.txt
whittled away by relic hunters until it,8245_0.txt
resembles a big toothpick.,8245_0.txt
One man appears to have worked a,8245_0.txt
"knot out of the board, and the ground",8245_0.txt
all about the well beaten grave is covered,8245_0.txt
with cartridge shells. There are,8245_0.txt
"frontiersmen, it appears, who show their",8245_0.txt
regard for Bill's memory by standing,8245_0.txt
upon his grave and emptying their ry-,8245_0.txt
"volvers into the air, throwing away their",8245_0.txt
cartridge shells as they reload. The other,8245_0.txt
day the city marshal found it necessary,8245_0.txt
"to run in one of these fellows, who had",8245_0.txt
done little else for a week except shoot,8245_0.txt
his revolvers over Wild Bill's grave. The,8245_0.txt
man appeared to have a genuine regard,8245_0.txt
"for the dead man's memory, and as he",8245_0.txt
submitted to arrest he expressed his,8245_0.txt
sense of the outrage in most,8245_0.txt

the jealous ire of her heavy weight,8246_0.txt
spouse. Last January she left him,8246_0.txt
"and went to Portland, Oregon, but",8246_0.txt
the husband started after her and,8246_0.txt
induced her to return to Pocatello.,8246_0.txt
On last Sunday Woods was missing,8246_0.txt
from Pocatello as were two,8246_0.txt
valuable horses from a ranch near,8246_0.txt
by and the last seen of the man,8246_0.txt
that day he was on horseback in,8246_0.txt
company with an Indian near the,8246_0.txt
town of Oxford. His wife was also,8246_0.txt
missing and suspicion was at once,8246_0.txt
aroused that she had been fouly,8246_0.txt
dealt with by her husband. So,8246_0.txt
firm was this suspicion that a reward,8246_0.txt
of$ 500 was offered for im-,8246_0.txt
"formation of her whereabouts, and",8246_0.txt
very shortly nearly every Indian,8246_0.txt
on the reservation was engaged in,8246_0.txt
the search which was continued until,8246_0.txt
Tuesday when the dead body of,8246_0.txt
the woman was found in a clump,8246_0.txt
of bushes about a mile from town.,8246_0.txt
The skull of the unfortunate woman,8246_0.txt
had been crushed by some,8246_0.txt
blunt weapon and the body otherwise,8246_0.txt
mutilated in a horrible manner,8246_0.txt
. But one opinion prevailed as,8246_0.txt
to how the woman had met her,8246_0.txt
death- by the hands of her brutal,8246_0.txt
husband- and no time was lost to,8246_0.txt
ensure his capture. The direction,8246_0.txt
in which he was going when last,8246_0.txt
seen on Sunday near Oxford led to,8246_0.txt
the belief that he would make for,8246_0.txt
the railroad as rapidly as possible,8246_0.txt
and the surmise was correct. An,8246_0.txt
account of the murder and a full,8246_0.txt
description of the murderer was at,8246_0.txt

that he would have been,8246_0.txt

James committed a nameless crime upon,8250_0.txt
"the person of a 5- year- old white girl, was",8250_0.txt
arrested and incarcerated in the county,8250_0.txt
jail. Rumors of the organization of,8250_0.txt
a mob to lynch the criminal reaching,8250_0.txt
"the ears of the officers, James was",8250_0.txt
secretly conveyed to the penitentiary,8250_0.txt
for safe- keeping. The mob organized,8250_0.txt
"early in the evening and, proceeding to",8250_0.txt
"the jail, demanded that the prisoner",8250_0.txt
be turned over to them for summary,8250_0.txt
punishment. The leaders were informed,8250_0.txt
that he was not in the jail. A,8250_0.txt
search confirmed this statement. In,8250_0.txt
some manner the enraged mob ascertained,8250_0.txt
that James had been placed in,8250_0.txt
the penitentiary. By this time their,8250_0.txt
ranks had been swelled to about a,8250_0.txt
thousand men. They at once repaired,8250_0.txt
to the penitentiary and demanded the,8250_0.txt
prisoner. Their demand was prompt-,8250_0.txt

upon themselves to avenge the greatest,8250_0.txt
crime that can be inflicted upon society.,8250_0.txt

"massive gates, under the influence of",8250_0.txt
the tremendous blows dealt by strong,8250_0.txt
"arms, went down like pasteboard.",8250_0.txt
The prisoner was quickly found and,8250_0.txt
secured and led forth for identification,8250_0.txt
". This done, he was dragged to",8250_0.txt
"the corner of Main and Fifth streets,",8250_0.txt
in the very heart of the business portion,8250_0.txt
"of the city, where he was allowed",8250_0.txt
a few moments for prayer. He first,8250_0.txt
denied and then admitted his guilt.,8250_0.txt
A rope was thrown over the cross- arm,8250_0.txt
"of a telephone pole, adjusted about the",8250_0.txt
trembling culprit's neck and he was,8250_0.txt

affords the remedy is questionable.,8250_0.txt
Almost daily we read of the,8250_0.txt
"up of lecherous beasts for this stringing offense,",8250_0.txt
but it does not diminish the crime. In,8250_0.txt
"fact, it is becoming so common that",8250_0.txt
men are beginning to feel they are incurring,8250_0.txt
a serious risk to leave the,8250_0.txt
females of their families unprotected,8250_0.txt
for even an hour. It is not our desire,8250_0.txt
"to unduly alarm anyone, but the facts,",8250_0.txt
"as daily recorded, bear us out in this",8250_0.txt
assertion. This crime is not confined,8250_0.txt
"to either color, but it is patent that",8250_0.txt
most of the rapes are committed by,8250_0.txt
negroes. Why this is true we cannot,8250_0.txt
"say, but that it is true no one will deny.",8250_0.txt
A remedy must be found- and found,8250_0.txt
speedily- or there is no telling to where,8250_0.txt
it will lead. If the courts cannot cope,8250_0.txt
"with it, then mobs will certainly take",8250_0.txt
the matter in hand; and if mob law,8250_0.txt
"can overcome the evil, then let us have",8250_0.txt
"the mobs. Anything, in the name of",8250_0.txt
"heaven, to put a stop to the infernal",8250_0.txt
crime.,8250_0.txt

MURDER AND LYNCHING IN AROOS-,8399_0.txt

Our despatches have given an account,8399_0.txt
of a terrible murder committed in Aroos-,8399_0.txt
"took county. There were two victims,",8399_0.txt
"both slain by one man, who afterwards",8399_0.txt
set the camp on fire in which the deed,8399_0.txt
"was committed, probably to conceal his",8399_0.txt
crime. What led the murderer to do the,8399_0.txt
"deed is not stated, nor have we full particulars",8399_0.txt
of the manner in which it,8399_0.txt
was consummated. The attack was,8399_0.txt
made while the murdered men were,8399_0.txt
"asleep, and must have been a desperate",8399_0.txt
"undertaking even then, since it appears",8399_0.txt
there were four persons in the camp at the,8399_0.txt
"time, two of whom escaped.",8399_0.txt
But terrible as was the murder of the,8399_0.txt
"two men, the hanging of the murderer",8399_0.txt
"without trial, under the fierce impulse for",8399_0.txt
revenge created by the first knowledge of,8399_0.txt
"the bloody tragedy, is an act for the most",8399_0.txt
profound regret and severe reprobation.,8399_0.txt
There is no decent apology whatever for,8399_0.txt
such an open defiance of law. The courts,8399_0.txt
"of justice in all parts of this State, in",8399_0.txt
"Aroostook as well as in southern counties,",8399_0.txt
"are accessible to all, and the criminal",8399_0.txt
would have had to pay the penalty for his,8399_0.txt
"deed which the law provides, even to",8399_0.txt
hanging had he been found guilty. How,8399_0.txt
much better is the act of the mob than that,8399_0.txt
of the murderer? They justify themselves,8399_0.txt
by pleading that the assassin deserved,8399_0.txt
death; he perhaps may have had real or,8399_0.txt
fancied wrongs which he believed a sufficient,8399_0.txt
justification for taking life. The law,8399_0.txt
of the mob is wicked and dangerous.,8399_0.txt
There is no limit to the evil which it may,8399_0.txt
inflict. No community with a proper re-,8399_0.txt

"Hayden took with him two men, Messrs. W.",8399_0.txt

They traced him to a shingle camp occupied,8399_0.txt
"by a man named Swanbeck, in Chapman",8399_0.txt
"plantation, which they reached late in the",8399_0.txt
evening. Cullen saw that open resistance,8399_0.txt

on returning matters might be satisfactorily,8399_0.txt

acknowledged breaking into. The hour was,8399_0.txt
"late, and it being some four miles to Presque",8399_0.txt
"Isle, over a hard woods road, the Sheriff and",8399_0.txt
his party concluded to remain in the camp until,8399_0.txt
"morning, and accordingly arranged themselves",8399_0.txt
for the night as comfortably as they,8399_0.txt
"could, and went to sleep, little thinking what",8399_0.txt
a terrible fate awaited three of the party.,8399_0.txt
Some time after midnight. Swanbeck and,8399_0.txt
"Bird were awakened by a noise in the camp,",8399_0.txt
and on arousing themselves were horrified to,8399_0.txt
see Cullen chopping the heads of Sheriff Hay-,8399_0.txt
"den and Mr. Hubbard, with an axe he had",8399_0.txt
found in the camp. Being nearer the door,8399_0.txt
"than the murderer, Swanbeck and Bird jumped",8399_0.txt
"up and ran for their lives, pursued for",8399_0.txt
"some distance by Cullen, who, seeming to be",8399_0.txt
"crazed by his infernal crime, brandished the",8399_0.txt
axe reeking with gore and yelled like a madman,8399_0.txt
.,8399_0.txt
Neither of the escaping men were armed,8399_0.txt
and they made their way through the woods,8399_0.txt
to the settlements as best they could in the,8399_0.txt
"darkness, to give the alarm. The word",8399_0.txt
"spread like wildfire, and the community was",8399_0.txt
soon aroused by the terrible news. A,8399_0.txt
led by Mr. B. J. Hughes started from Ball's party,8399_0.txt
"mill for the camp, which they found to be",8399_0.txt
"a pile of smoking ashes, under which lay the",8399_0.txt

the torch after committing the awful,8399_0.txt
"deed, in order to conceal the evidence of his",8399_0.txt

The most intense excitement was created,8399_0.txt
"by the news, and several parties of men arm-",8399_0.txt
themselves and started in pursuit of the,8399_0.txt
murderer. One party went directly to Cul-,8399_0.txt
"len's house in Mapleton, Wednesday morning",8399_0.txt
", but Mrs. Cullen declared her husband",8399_0.txt
"was not in. Search was made, however, and",8399_0.txt
he was found secreted in the cellar. He was,8399_0.txt
"dragged from his place of concealment, securely",8399_0.txt
"bound, and his captors started to bring",8399_0.txt
him into Presque Isle. On their way they,8399_0.txt
"were met by a party from that village, who",8399_0.txt
"took possession of the prisoner, led him under",8399_0.txt
"a tall tree, gave him a few minutes for prayer,",8399_0.txt

employed the three ablest criminal lawyers in,8400_0.txt
Cincinnati to defend his son. In the outset of,8400_0.txt
"the case, by the advice of his attorneys, Berner",8400_0.txt
offered to plead guilty to murder in the second,8400_0.txt
"degree, for which the only penalty in Ohio is",8400_0.txt
imprisonment for life. The State's Attorney,8400_0.txt
"would not accept this plea, and the trial went",8400_0.txt
"on. Judge Charles Matthews, brother of the",8400_0.txt
"Hon. Stanley Matthews, heard the case. A",8400_0.txt
strong effort was made to rule out Berner's,8400_0.txt
"confession, but without success. The arguments",8400_0.txt
"were long, able, and exhaustive. All",8400_0.txt
that Berner's counsel hoped for was to save,8400_0.txt
him from hanging. The case was given to the,8400_0.txt
jury on Saturday night at 10 o'clock. They held,8400_0.txt
it two hours and were dismissed until to- day.,8400_0.txt
This morning early not only the court room,8400_0.txt
but the corridors near it were jammed with,8400_0.txt
"people, who waited patiently for the verdict.",8400_0.txt
The jury sent in to ask the Court if they might,8400_0.txt
recommend mercy. Then the State's Attorney,8400_0.txt
"remarked,"" We are gone; we are gone."" Judge",8400_0.txt
"Matthews said,"" I guess they will bring in a verdict",8400_0.txt

came the announcement that the jury were,8400_0.txt
ready with their verdict. The court room was,8400_0.txt
BO packed that the bailiffs had difficulty in,8400_0.txt
clearing a way for the jurors. A dead silence,8400_0.txt
prevailed until the foreman read the following,8400_0.txt
words:,8400_0.txt
"We, the jury, in the issue joined find the defendant.",8400_0.txt
"Wm. Berner, not guilty of murder in the first degree,",8400_0.txt
but guilty of manslaughter.,8400_0.txt
"Then a cry of surprise, mingled with expressions",8400_0.txt
"of indignation and rage, burst from the",8400_0.txt
whole audience. Before a minute had passed.,8400_0.txt
the bailiff seized the prisoner and hurried him,8400_0.txt
behind the Judge's desk and took him through,8400_0.txt
the Judge's private room down the back stairs,8400_0.txt
and through the tunnel leading over into the,8400_0.txt
jail. The Court asked the prisoner's counsel if,8400_0.txt
they wished the jury polled. They said they,8400_0.txt
did. The same was asked of the prosecutors.,8400_0.txt
"' No. sir."" exclaimed Messrs. Pugh and",8400_0.txt
"Thomas,"" we don't want any polling from that",8400_0.txt

It was not necessary to ask the Court what,8400_0.txt
he thought of the verdict. With an indignation,8400_0.txt
that he shared with hundreds of others around,8400_0.txt
"him, he could not refrain from expressing",8400_0.txt
"himself in an undertone in these words:"" It's",8400_0.txt
"a damned outrage."" Without the customary",8400_0.txt
thanks to the jury for their faithfulness in doing,8400_0.txt
"their duty, he simply said:"" The jury is",8400_0.txt
"dismissed.""",8400_0.txt
When the jurors left the room they were,8400_0.txt
"hooted, and on the streets an enraged crowd",8400_0.txt

From a political point of view,8412_0.txt
today's lynching figures tell a,8412_0.txt
story that must cause progressive,8412_0.txt
Americans seriously to think,8412_0.txt
and also to act in self- defense.,8412_0.txt

"In less than two months, fourteen",8412_0.txt

Americans.,8412_0.txt
THE PICTURE in a thousand,8412_0.txt
aspects resembles the rise of,8412_0.txt
Nazi terror in Hitler land in the,8412_0.txt
1930's. Therein lies the difference,8412_0.txt
with yesterday's lynchings. The,8412_0.txt
most startling feature reveals,8412_0.txt
the Ku Klux Klan developing as,8412_0.txt
the main instrument of terror.,8412_0.txt
The Klan seems now an officially,8412_0.txt
blessed terror of,8412_0.txt
weapon,8412_0.txt
American Big Business and its,8412_0.txt
"landlord henchmen, truly a storm",8412_0.txt
trooper organization. The Department,8412_0.txt
of Justice winks at its,8412_0.txt
"murderings, the F.B.I. is not concerned",8412_0.txt
.,8412_0.txt
Here is no new crisis in race,8412_0.txt
relations. We are confronted now,8412_0.txt
"w a terror drive, an organized",8412_0.txt
campaign of of terror directed,8412_0.txt
physically against Negro America,8412_0.txt
. But the ultimate political objectives,8412_0.txt
are not difficult to understand,8412_0.txt
. Monopoly is splitting,8412_0.txt
the progressive camp. One section,8412_0.txt
is being split away and,8412_0.txt
"beaten into submission, beaten if",8412_0.txt
possible into acceptance of a,8412_0.txt
semi- slave status. The other section,8412_0.txt
of our population shows no,8412_0.txt
grave concern.,8412_0.txt
The Negro is first selected because,8412_0.txt
the history of America reveals,8412_0.txt
that attacks of violence,8412_0.txt
against Negroes are least disturbing,8412_0.txt
to white America. Therein,8412_0.txt
lies the menace of this terror,8412_0.txt
campaign. White progressives,8412_0.txt
are not truly alarmed. If this,8412_0.txt
attack succeeds terror in full volume,8412_0.txt
will be launched next,8412_0.txt
"against labor, the Jewish people,",8412_0.txt
Catholic laity and other,8412_0.txt
groupings. This is the fascis,8412_0.txt
pattern. It succeeded in Germany,8412_0.txt
. It succeeded in France.,8412_0.txt
Reaction believes it can succeed,8412_0.txt
here- it can.,8412_0.txt
SO FAR this terroristic ma-,8412_0.txt
neuvre has suceeded. The trade,8412_0.txt
unions show no clear recognition,8412_0.txt
that they are the ultimate object,8412_0.txt
of this terror and therefore must,8412_0.txt
act to stop it now. They have not,8412_0.txt
yet learned to accept the Negro,8412_0.txt
as a full partner in the progressive,8412_0.txt
ranks. They do not see that,8412_0.txt
what hurts Negro America injures,8412_0.txt
them. They do not see that,8412_0.txt
the Negro- labor alliance is a natural,8412_0.txt
.,8412_0.txt
The situation is dangerous in,8412_0.txt
the extreme. White middle class,8412_0.txt
America will truly rally to fight,8412_0.txt
the terror against Negro America,8412_0.txt
only if it sees labor in action,8412_0.txt
against the Negro baiters and if,8412_0.txt
labor explains fully why it acts.,8412_0.txt
Of course labor's action in this,8412_0.txt
fight for Negro rights is no altruistic,8412_0.txt
purely humanitarian matter,8412_0.txt
. The fight has its moral side,8412_0.txt
but this is not the major characteristic,8412_0.txt

tection not out of charity. Only,8412_0.txt
those who out of blood coin gold,8412_0.txt
send men to the wars for charitable,8412_0.txt
reasons. Labor must act and,8412_0.txt
at once to clarify its own house,8412_0.txt

EXTRA. NYE'S BILL,8463_1.txt
It Was Abous a Hanging and Was Very,8463_1.txt

"The last time Bill Nye was in Chicago,",8463_1.txt
"shortly before his death, I asked him how",8463_1.txt

""" Why, bless your heart, I didn't,"" he",8463_1.txt
"said."" I didn't go out to Wyoming to be",8463_1.txt
funny. I went to Laramie to get rich and,8463_1.txt
got away again just as soon as I could. In,8463_1.txt
the meantime I tried humor simply in self,8463_1.txt
defense. Laramie was one of those towns,8463_1.txt
that never are- but always are about to be,8463_1.txt
"―blest. When I arrived, I found a mushroom",8463_1.txt
mining town. The population consisted,8463_1.txt
"of cowboys, Mexicans, rustlers, half",8463_1.txt
"breeds, Chinamen and speculative riffraff.",8463_1.txt
The whole place was sizzling with excitement,8463_1.txt
", and I felt sure that Laramie was to",8463_1.txt
become a second Chicago and Wyoming a,8463_1.txt
new El Dorado. What little money I had,8463_1.txt
went into mining claims. But I fancied I,8463_1.txt
had a longer head than the average speculator,8463_1.txt
and decided to establish some solid,8463_1.txt
business. I started a paper. I hoped that,8463_1.txt
"in time, as the city grew into metropolitan",8463_1.txt
"proportions, my weekly would blossom",8463_1.txt
"out into a great influential daily, and in",8463_1.txt
fancy I saw myself the Pulitzer of the,8463_1.txt
west. But the lead of ore played out and,8463_1.txt
the town instantly collapsed. Those who,8463_1.txt
had enough money to get out of Laramie,8463_1.txt
did so. Those who had not staid. I remained,8463_1.txt
.,8463_1.txt
""" I hung on to the paper in the hope that",8463_1.txt
I could sell it some time. But no purchaser,8463_1.txt
came my way. The motley crowd of,8463_1.txt
stranded speculators left behind by the,8463_1.txt
"boom could not support a paper, and, in",8463_1.txt
"fact, a large proportion of them couldn't",8463_1.txt
read anyway. There was no news. Every,8463_1.txt
"little occurrence was seized upon eagerly,",8463_1.txt
and I spun it out as far as I could to fill up,8463_1.txt
my paper. A deg fight any time was good,8463_1.txt

writing humorous sketches merely to,8463_1.txt

", but I sent the paper to every leading",8463_1.txt
"journal in the country, and in a short time",8463_1.txt
my stuff began to be copied. That was the,8463_1.txt
beginning of the end.,8463_1.txt
""" At one time, I remember, we had a",8463_1.txt
hanging scheduled. Of course we often,8463_1.txt
"had little informal, impromptu hangings,",8463_1.txt
"but this one was to be a real, genuine, legal",8463_1.txt
execution. A half drunken miner had shot,8463_1.txt
down a saloon keeper without the slightest,8463_1.txt
provocation. There was no doubt about,8463_1.txt
the fellow's guilt. He admitted it himself.,8463_1.txt
Ordinarily he would have been lynched,8463_1.txt
"right away, but several of us talked the",8463_1.txt
matter over and decided that the murderer,8463_1.txt
ought not to be wasted. We would use him,8463_1.txt
as an advertisement. We held that a legal,8463_1.txt
execution would be a good card for the,8463_1.txt
town and would show the world at large,8463_1.txt
"that Laramie was not a wild, lawless place,",8463_1.txt
"but a law abiding city, with established",8463_1.txt
courts and officials to enforce the law properly,8463_1.txt

The murderer himself was mightily,8463_1.txt
pleased with the idea. He relished the notoriety,8463_1.txt
"it would give him, and immediately",8463_1.txt
became the prcudest man in town. There,8463_1.txt
was no jail. Laramie in those days didn't,8463_1.txt
need one anyway. Lawbreakers never,8463_1.txt
were fed at public expense. They were,8463_1.txt
lynched or given notice to get out of town.,8463_1.txt
Court was held in the rear room of a grocery,8463_1.txt
". A jury was sworn in, and everything",8463_1.txt
was done as nearly according to law as,8463_1.txt
possible. The prisoner was sentenced to,8463_1.txt
"hang, and the day of execution was fixed",8463_1.txt
for the following Friday. I raised an objection,8463_1.txt
to this and pointed out to the court,8463_1.txt
that I would require more time in order to,8463_1.txt
get up a creditable newspaper account of,8463_1.txt
the affair in a special edition which was to,8463_1.txt
be sent broadcast to advertise the town. So,8463_1.txt

THE EDGEFIELD LYNCHING.,8521_0.txt
Extenuating Statements which are Made,8521_0.txt
in Behalf of the Accused.,8521_0.txt
( Special to the News and Courier.),8521_0.txt
"AUGUSTA, GA., October 22 .-- This",8521_0.txt
beautiful city is so near to Edgefield,8521_0.txt
and is so intimately connected with,8521_0.txt
the county that no day passes that,8521_0.txt
several Edgefield men are not seen ou,8521_0.txt
"the umbrageous streets. It is easy,",8521_0.txt
"therefore, to obtain the gossip concerning",8521_0.txt
the Edgefield affairs which,8521_0.txt
rarely finds its way into print. The,8521_0.txt
all- absorbing topic in Edgefield at,8521_0.txt
"this time is the lynching of Culbreath,",8521_0.txt
and it must be admitted that the statements,8521_0.txt
which are made in Augusta,8521_0.txt
upon the subject change materially,8521_0.txt
the aspect of the deplorable affair.,8521_0.txt
It is asserted that Mr. Culbreath,8521_0.txt
treated his wife with the utmost brutality,8521_0.txt
"after her father's death, and that",8521_0.txt
his conduct was so offensive to the,8521_0.txt
people that it is surprising that he was,8521_0.txt
not lynched at an earlier day. Among,8521_0.txt
"his other offences, it is said that in a",8521_0.txt
drunken fit he lashed his wife severely,8521_0.txt
"with a buggy whip, and when remonstrated",8521_0.txt
with by her mother lashed,8521_0.txt
that lady in the same way. As a consequence,8521_0.txt
of his behavior a separation,8521_0.txt
",",8521_0.txt
"took place. Mr. Culbreath, however,",8521_0.txt
continued a surveillance over his wife's,8521_0.txt
"actions, and without any reason whatever",8521_0.txt
was furiously jealous. As is,8521_0.txt
"known, Mr. Hammond was assassinated",8521_0.txt
in the yard of Mrs. Culbreath's house,8521_0.txt
where he had gone at the request of,8521_0.txt
her son to remain for the night. One,8521_0.txt
of my informants says that he knows,8521_0.txt
it to be a fact that Mr. Culbreath,8521_0.txt
"caused Hammond to be assassinated,",8521_0.txt
and that he was as much the assassin,8521_0.txt
as though he had actually pulled the,8521_0.txt
"trigger. This, at all evens, was believed",8521_0.txt
in the county and was the immediate,8521_0.txt
"cause of the lynching, The people",8521_0.txt
of the county felt that such conduct,8521_0.txt
"should be tolerated no longer,",8521_0.txt
and they unwisely took the law into,8521_0.txt
their own hands. An Edgefield man,8521_0.txt
"whom I talked with said, with great",8521_0.txt
"emphasis, that he held that lynching",8521_0.txt
"was never justifiable, but if ever it was",8521_0.txt
to be justifiable it was so in Culbreath's,8521_0.txt
CASC.,8521_0.txt
There are now in Edgefield jail more,8521_0.txt
than thirty persons who are accused,8521_0.txt
of participation in the lynching. The,8521_0.txt
accommodations are altogether insufficient,8521_0.txt
", and the prisoners are threatened",8521_0.txt
with disease by reason of the condition,8521_0.txt
of the buildings in which they are,8521_0.txt
confined. They did not apply for,8521_0.txt

"ready, and their suffering is not in",8521_0.txt
their confinement alone The accused,8521_0.txt
.,8521_0.txt
form the bulk of the adult male population,8521_0.txt
of two or more townships in,8521_0.txt
Edgefield county They are taken,8521_0.txt
.,8521_0.txt
from their plantations at a busy season,8521_0.txt
"of the year, and in their absence it is",8521_0.txt
impracticable to control the colored,8521_0.txt
"laborers, who are filching the cotton",8521_0.txt
It is,8521_0.txt
from the fields right and left.,8521_0.txt
asserted in all seriousness that many,8521_0.txt
families will be deprived of bread and,8521_0.txt
"meat by the arrest of the accused, all",8521_0.txt
"of whom, it is said, are ready to give",8521_0.txt
bail to any amount that may be requiry,8521_0.txt
ed.,8521_0.txt
I give these statements in order that,8521_0.txt
the public may know what is said by,8521_0.txt
those who are acquainted with the,8521_0.txt
"lynchers, and who feel that the act was",8521_0.txt
so nearly justifiable that there is no,8521_0.txt
"reason to keep the accused in jail, and",8521_0.txt
"who maintain, further, that the facts",8521_0.txt
to be developed before the grand jury,8521_0.txt
or in open Court will satisfy the public,8521_0.txt
mind that no great wrong has been,8521_0.txt
done.,8521_0.txt
When it is urged that the,8521_0.txt
"Courts should have been resorted to, it",8521_0.txt
", is shown that the original offences of",8521_0.txt
Culbreath could not have been made,8521_0.txt
the subject of a judicial investigation,8521_0.txt
without a public scandal.,8521_0.txt
As regards the assassination of Ham-,8521_0.txt
"mond there is a feeling, I am sorry to",8521_0.txt
"say, that whatever the evidence, Cul-",8521_0.txt
"- breath would not have been convicted,",8521_0.txt
and that lynch law was the only law,8521_0.txt
that would meet his case. The accused,8521_0.txt
"are said to be highly respectable, industrious",8521_0.txt
"and well- behaved citizens,",8521_0.txt
"who would never, save as a last resort,",8521_0.txt
be guilty of an act of violence of any,8521_0.txt
kind.,8521_0.txt
All this is given to the readers of the,8521_0.txt

"for the year 1912, reported 171, so",8545_0.txt
that the record stands exactly,8545_0.txt
same number of homicides in 1913 the,8545_0.txt
as in 1912 among the same counties.,8545_0.txt
"During the years of 1910 and 1911, or",8545_0.txt
"at least until the 28th day of July,",8545_0.txt
"1911, legal executions were permitted",8545_0.txt
in Oklahoma; during the years,8545_0.txt
"of 1912 1913, no legal executions",8545_0.txt
"have taken and place, and yet these fig-",8545_0.txt
ures disclose the fact that during the,8545_0.txt
two latter years there was a very,8545_0.txt
material decrease in the number of,8545_0.txt
homicides committed as compared,8545_0.txt
with the two preceding years.,8545_0.txt
It is unnecessary to comment upon,8545_0.txt
these figures. To anyone of ordinary,8545_0.txt
"inteligence they interpret themselves,",8545_0.txt
and answer conclusively the theories,8545_0.txt
and conclusions of those who discuss,8545_0.txt
the question without informing,8545_0.txt
themselves as to conditions and facts.,8545_0.txt
The position I have taken is that,8545_0.txt
capital punishment as a deterrent for,8545_0.txt
the crime of murder is neither effective,8545_0.txt
"nor wise. I believe, however, that",8545_0.txt
men rightfully convicted of the crime,8545_0.txt
of murder should be made to spend,8545_0.txt
the remainder of their lives in the,8545_0.txt
"penitentiary, and I have acted upon",8545_0.txt
this theory. While I have granted,8545_0.txt
twelve commutations of death sentences,8545_0.txt
to life imprisonment during,8545_0.txt
"my three years of administration, I",8545_0.txt
have only issued one parole to a man,8545_0.txt
"serving a life sentence for murder,",8545_0.txt
and that was in the case of a young,8545_0.txt
man committed from Pottawatomie,8545_0.txt
"county, in which the judge, prosecuting",8545_0.txt
attorney and jury engaged in the,8545_0.txt
trial and conviction of the defendant,8545_0.txt
all petitioned me to parole upon the,8545_0.txt
ground that the defendant should not,8545_0.txt
have been convicted in the first place.,8545_0.txt
During the two years imediately,8545_0.txt
"preceding my induction into office,",8545_0.txt
seventeen persons serving life sentences,8545_0.txt
were liberated on parole. Se,8545_0.txt
the record stands for three years of,8545_0.txt
my administration twelve commuta-,8545_0.txt
tions of death sentences to life imprisonment,8545_0.txt
", one parole of a life prisoner",8545_0.txt
"for murder, while in the two",8545_0.txt
"years immediately preceding me, the",8545_0.txt
record is four commutations of death,8545_0.txt
"sentences to life imprisonment, and",8545_0.txt
seventeen paroles of life prisoners,8545_0.txt
charged with murder.,8545_0.txt
I do not cite these facts as any,8545_0.txt
criticism of the former administration,8545_0.txt
", nor as a justification of what I",8545_0.txt
"have done, but simply as an evidence",8545_0.txt
of the fact that the criticism that has,8545_0.txt
"been leveled against me, is not the",8545_0.txt
"cutgrowth of honest conviction, but",8545_0.txt
that it is personal in its character,8545_0.txt
and not directed at the principle involved,8545_0.txt
. No such criticism was visited,8545_0.txt
"upon former governors, and yet",8545_0.txt
to me society has much more to fear,8545_0.txt
"from the liberation of a murderer,",8545_0.txt
"serving a life sentence, than it has",8545_0.txt
to fear from the confinement for the,8545_0.txt
rest of his life of a murderer who has,8545_0.txt
been sentenced to death.,8545_0.txt
It seems that some men cannot,8545_0.txt
understand that the governor of the,8545_0.txt
state is supposed to be the governor,8545_0.txt
of all of the people. As the governor,8545_0.txt
it is my duty in the enforcement,8545_0.txt
of the law to see that law is enforced,8545_0.txt
against all men with equal,8545_0.txt
fairness and justice. In 1912 sixty,8545_0.txt
negroes committed homicides in Ok-,8545_0.txt
"lahoma, 120 white men were charged",8545_0.txt
with the same offense. During my,8545_0.txt
term of office I have only had to,8545_0.txt
commute the death sentence of one,8545_0.txt
"white man, while I have commuted",8545_0.txt
the death sentences of eleven ne-,8545_0.txt
groes. Though twice as many white,8545_0.txt
"men committed murder as negroes,",8545_0.txt
in the administration of our law wa,8545_0.txt
undertake to hang eleven times as,8545_0.txt
many negroes as whites for the same,8545_0.txt
offense. If this be a fair administra-,8545_0.txt
"of justice and of right, then my",8545_0.txt
tion ideas of justice are terribly pervert,8545_0.txt
ed. Had I permitted the hanging of,8545_0.txt
"those eleven negroes, and commuted",8545_0.txt
"the death sentence of the white man,",8545_0.txt
and followed that by releasing on panent,8545_0.txt
role from the penitentiary half of the,8545_0.txt
"murderers there serving life terms,",8545_0.txt
there would have been little criticism,8545_0.txt
of my conduct by those who,8545_0.txt
now discover so much to find fault,8545_0.txt
with.,8545_0.txt
It is not an uncommon thing to,8545_0.txt
find among those who cry out against,8545_0.txt
the commuting of death sentences to,8545_0.txt
life imprisonment many who are,8545_0.txt
ready to sign petitions importuning,8545_0.txt
the governor to grant paroles and parlic,8545_0.txt
dons to men serving life sentences,8545_0.txt
for murder.,8545_0.txt
It has been said by some of the ed-,8545_0.txt
itors that I should permit legal exa-,8545_0.txt
cutions in order to prevent lynchings,8545_0.txt
"-in other words, to appease the mob,",8545_0.txt
yet every man who assists as a mom,8545_0.txt
ber of a mob in the hanging of an individual,8545_0.txt
", no matter what crime may",8545_0.txt
"have been committed, is, under the",8545_0.txt
law guilty of murder and if the law,8545_0.txt
should be enforced against these individuals,8545_0.txt
", every one of them would",8545_0.txt
have to be electrocuted or sent to,8545_0.txt
the penitentiary for life. How many,8545_0.txt
of these critics and editors would be,8545_0.txt
willing to see the members of the,8545_0.txt
mob that recently hanged the negro,8545_0.txt
"in Cleveland county, either electrocuted",8545_0.txt
or sent to the penitentiary for,8545_0.txt
"life? And yet, this is what would result",8545_0.txt
", were"" the law of Oklahoma enforced",8545_0.txt
".""",8545_0.txt
In this entire matter I am doing,8545_0.txt
what I think it is my duty to do. I,8545_0.txt
"am not trying to please the mob, and",8545_0.txt
shall never be swerved from the,8545_0.txt
path of duty nor hesitate in my efforts,8545_0.txt
to bring about a better condition,8545_0.txt
of law observance in Oklahoma in order,8545_0.txt
to satisfy the demands of a mob,8545_0.txt
or the clamor of that class of our,8545_0.txt

to discredit the citizenship and civilization,8545_0.txt
of this state in the eyes of,8545_0.txt
the world than do all the commuta-,8545_0.txt

tions that could be executed in,8545_0.txt
hundred years. Oklahoma IS civilized,8545_0.txt
", as much so as any other people",8545_0.txt
"in the world, and if we have not yet",8545_0.txt
advanced to that degree of civilization,8545_0.txt
where capital punishment can,8545_0.txt
"be abolished with safety, we will never",8545_0.txt
be civilized to that extent. Murdering,8545_0.txt
", either under the guise of the",8545_0.txt
"law or through mob violence, has",8545_0.txt
never yet tended to lift a people indulging,8545_0.txt

"alization, and the record as disclosed",8545_0.txt
"above, shows that in Oklahoma civilization",8545_0.txt
quickly responds to every effort,8545_0.txt
made in the interest of humanity,8545_0.txt
.,8545_0.txt
In passing let me say that seventy,8545_0.txt
- five per cent of the homicides committed,8545_0.txt
"Oklahoma ,, according to",8545_0.txt
the record in is due to the fact that the,8545_0.txt
prohibition and gambling laws are being,8545_0.txt
violated. If these mobs that cry,8545_0.txt
"for human blood, and editors that",8545_0.txt
write daily and weekly lectures to,8545_0.txt
"the governor about law enforcement,",8545_0.txt
from Oklahoma the botlegger and,8545_0.txt
would interest themselves in driving,8545_0.txt

"homa City recently, and there would",8545_0.txt

make it possible to enforce Oklaho-,8545_0.txt
"ma's criminal statutes, these same",8545_0.txt
people are quick to come to a defense,8545_0.txt
of the gambler and the bootlegger by,8545_0.txt
arguing that the passage of such laws,8545_0.txt
would be giving to the governor of,8545_0.txt
"the state"" autocratic power"" which",8545_0.txt
"might be abused, and thus is the argument",8545_0.txt
made effective which perpetuates,8545_0.txt
"conditions, while the enemies of",8545_0.txt

In conclusion I have no hesitancy,8545_0.txt
in stating that inflamamtory editorials,8545_0.txt

Soon after midnight a badly scared urchin,8554_1.txt
told the following story:,8554_1.txt
"Near Swede Hill, on the outskirts of the",8554_1.txt
"city, a man named Anderson had been in",8554_1.txt
bed but a short time when a band of eight,8554_1.txt

in front of the house. Five of the men dismounted,8554_1.txt

"the other three, went silently to the house.",8554_1.txt
A loud rap brought Mr. Anderson to the,8554_1.txt
door in his night dress. Without saying a,8554_1.txt
word the leader of the party threw a blanket,8554_1.txt
over Anderson's head. He was then thrown,8554_1.txt
"down, his hands securely pinioned, and the",8554_1.txt
"party marched away, dragging their helpless",8554_1.txt
victim with them.,8554_1.txt
"He struggled furiously, but the superior",8554_1.txt
force of the assailants was too much for the,8554_1.txt
unarmed prisoner. The White Caps went a,8554_1.txt
short distance up the hill and then turned,8554_1.txt
"into a vacant lot, in which a few trees were",8554_1.txt
standing. The helpless man was securely,8554_1.txt
"tied to a tree, and while the rest of the",8554_1.txt
"White Caps formed in a semicircle, the leader",8554_1.txt
"took a heavy whip, and still maintaining",8554_1.txt
"the strictest silence, began to rain blows on",8554_1.txt
"the writhing form of his victim, who groaned",8554_1.txt

What is the use of maintaining courts,8600_0.txt

for them that lynch law is resorted,8600_0.txt

"Baxter nearly two weeks ago, had decided",8600_0.txt
"to let the law take its course, because of",8600_0.txt
the difficulty of determining who committed,8600_0.txt
the crime. It was first proposed,8600_0.txt
"to lynch a man named Henry Williams,",8600_0.txt
but he succeeded in showing that he was,8600_0.txt
not near the scene of the crime on the,8600_0.txt
the crime was committed. day,8600_0.txt
"John Peterson, against whom suspicion",8600_0.txt
"rested, surrendered to Gov. Tillman on",8600_0.txt
"Saturday, and he was taken to Denmark",8600_0.txt
for identification. He was not identified,8600_0.txt
by either the victim of the outrage or by,8600_0.txt
her little brother who saw the,8600_0.txt
negro who attempted the assault.,8600_0.txt
He produced several black witnesses to,8600_0.txt
show his whereabouts at the time the,8600_0.txt
girl was attacked. It is true they were,8600_0.txt
contradicted bya white witness and a black,8600_0.txt
"one, but neither of these witnesses testified",8600_0.txt
to the guilt of the accused. Their,8600_0.txt
testimony was to the effect that he was at,8600_0.txt
Denmark on the night preceding the day,8600_0.txt
on which the assault was attempted and,8600_0.txt
"that he left on the day of the assault, going",8600_0.txt
in the direction of the scene of the,8600_0.txt
crime.,8600_0.txt
There was certainly room for doubting,8600_0.txt
the guilt of Peterson. There was room,8600_0.txt
for such a doubt as would have made a,8600_0.txt
jury hesitate to find a verdict of guilty.,8600_0.txt
As far as can be judged from what has,8600_0.txt
appeared in our dispatches no one can say,8600_0.txt
that the man who was lynched was guilty,8600_0.txt
of the crime.,8600_0.txt
Gov. Tillman is known to be strongly,8600_0.txt
against lynchings. If we are not mistaken,8600_0.txt
he has said he would use his,8600_0.txt
power to the utmost to prevent them;,8600_0.txt
but did he not make a serious mistake in,8600_0.txt
"permitting Peterson, who had sought his",8600_0.txt
"protection, to be taken to Denmark?",8600_0.txt
"He knew, of course, that there was great",8600_0.txt
"excitement at Denmark, and that however",8600_0.txt
strong the purpose might be to,8600_0.txt
"lynch only the man guilty of the crime,",8600_0.txt
evidence that seemed to point to Peterson,8600_0.txt
as that man might be considered as sufficient,8600_0.txt
to justify lynching him. Peterson,8600_0.txt
should not have been taken to Denmark,8600_0.txt
"at all until the excitement had died out,",8600_0.txt
or if his presence there immediately was,8600_0.txt
necessary he should have been sent under,8600_0.txt
a guard strong enough to protect him.,8600_0.txt
It is bad enough to lynch a man proved,8600_0.txt
beyond doubt to be guilty of a crime deserving,8600_0.txt
"death, but the lynching of a man",8600_0.txt
of whose guilt there is a doubt calls,8600_0.txt
the severest condemnation. There is for no,8600_0.txt
intimation as yet as to the course Gov.,8600_0.txt
"Tillman will take in this Denmark affair,",8600_0.txt
but in view of his utterances relative to,8600_0.txt
"lynchings, and the fact that the man who",8600_0.txt
"was lynched had sought his protection, it",8600_0.txt
is difficult to see how he can fail to take,8600_0.txt
some action.,8600_0.txt
The crime of which Peterson was accused,8600_0.txt
"was a terrible one, and had he been",8600_0.txt
shown to be guilty there would be no re-,8600_0.txt
"cret for his fate, however greatly the",8600_0.txt
resort to lynch law might be deplored.,8600_0.txt
But there were reasons for doubting his,8600_0.txt
"guilt. Indeed, it is safe to say that it not",8600_0.txt
infrequently happens that innocent men,8600_0.txt
are the victims of mob law. It is better,8600_0.txt
that a guilty man should escape now and,8600_0.txt
then than that an innocent man should,8600_0.txt
be lynched. The people should be taught,8600_0.txt
to look to the courts and not to mob violence,8600_0.txt
for the punishment of criminals.,8600_0.txt
"Lynchings, although not confined to the",8600_0.txt
"south, are being used against the south",8600_0.txt
because of the number of them occurring,8600_0.txt

"streets in the vicinity of the jail, until by",8610_1.txt
ten o'clock several thousand men and boys.,8610_1.txt
were in the neighborhood. Later another-,8610_1.txt

"Jefferson streets, where they were met by",8610_1.txt

"but the latter stood firm, and for a time.",8610_1.txt
"there was a pell- mell, hand- to- hand fight,",8610_1.txt
which resulted in several broken heads and.,8610_1.txt
arrests. The leaders were soon taken and,8610_1.txt

"after pursuing them a short distance, returned",8610_1.txt
"and formed a line across the street ,.",8610_1.txt
where they remained on guard.,8610_1.txt
The answer of the Governor to a call for,8610_1.txt
aid from the militia was received at 11:15,8610_1.txt
"o'clock yesterday morning, and several.",8610_1.txt

that the alarm was the usual call to notify,8610_1.txt
the members of the legion when they were.,8610_1.txt
expected to report for duty at the armory.,8610_1.txt
The people misunderstood the alarm. The,8610_1.txt
crowd then dispersed and no more trouble.,8610_1.txt
was feared. Late in the afternoon the,8610_1.txt
mayor issued the following proclamation:,8610_1.txt
"MAYOR'S OFFICE, LOUISVILLE, Ky., April 29.",8610_1.txt
To the people of Louisville: It is my duty,8610_1.txt
as mayor to enjoin upon the people the neces--,8610_1.txt
sity for preserving order and maintaining the,8610_1.txt
majesty of the law. A most diabolical crime,8610_1.txt
"has been committed in our city, but the",8610_1.txt
law must inflict the punishment. A riot.,8610_1.txt
is more dangerous to good government.,8610_1.txt
than any individual criminal. Lynch law,8610_1.txt
subverts every principle of law and attacks,8610_1.txt
"our very civilization. I, therefore, in",8610_1.txt
"the discharge of my duty, request every citizen",8610_1.txt
to remain at home to- night and to avoid all,8610_1.txt
"gatherings, and I caution parents not to permit.",8610_1.txt
"their children to go in the streets, as their",8610_1.txt
presence increases the number and adds to the,8610_1.txt
excitement. I must and will discharge my,8610_1.txt
duty to uphold the law and to preserve good,8610_1.txt
"order, and I command all riotous assemblages.",8610_1.txt
"to disperse. P. B. REED, Mayor.",8610_1.txt
While the mayor was inditing the above,8610_1.txt
the first movement looking to an organization,8610_1.txt
"of the exasperated people, who openly",8610_1.txt
"and on all sides advocated lynching, was",8610_1.txt
being made. In response to a notice which,8610_1.txt
had been distributed among the thousands,8610_1.txt

", given to order the members of the",8610_1.txt
"militia to report for duty, about 500 men",8610_1.txt

Market street. The janitor refused them,8610_1.txt
admission to the hall and the police were.,8610_1.txt
"endeavoring to disperse them, when Dr.",8610_1.txt
"Berry, a well known physician of the city,",8610_1.txt
mounted a barrel on the sidewalk and addressed,8610_1.txt
them. He said that since the,8610_1.txt
brutal crime of Patterson and Turner none,8610_1.txt
of the women and children feel any security,8610_1.txt
", and that while he generally was opposed",8610_1.txt
"to mob law, there was nothing to be",8610_1.txt
done in this case but to lynch the negro,8610_1.txt
fiends. The law had again and again failed,8610_1.txt
to punish murderers. They had been sent.,8610_1.txt
to the penitentiary when they ought to,8610_1.txt
have been hung. The lawyers defended,8610_1.txt
blood- stained criminals whom they knew to-,8610_1.txt
be guilty. If this crime was not atoned,8610_1.txt
for a chance would be missed to set a terrible,8610_1.txt
"example to the hundreds of idle,",8610_1.txt
worthless and thieving negroes who infested,8610_1.txt
the alleys and slums of the city.,8610_1.txt
The doctor was cheered at frequent intervals,8610_1.txt
". While he was speaking Major Kinney,",8610_1.txt
"a leading criminal lawyer, passed through",8610_1.txt
the crowd. A number of the men stopped,8610_1.txt
"him and then, surrounding him, demanded",8610_1.txt
in an excited manner why he defended,8610_1.txt
men whom he knew to be criminals. The,8610_1.txt
major commenced to explain and expostulate,8610_1.txt
", declaring that he had never acted as",8610_1.txt
attorney for a man whom he believed to be,8610_1.txt
guilty. He was never more earnest or eloquent,8610_1.txt
"in his life, and breathed a heavy sigh",8610_1.txt
of relief when he slipped out of that throng.,8610_1.txt
The doctor resumed his remarks and the,8610_1.txt
"meeting adjourned to a hall near by, where",8610_1.txt
the names of about one hundred citizens.,8610_1.txt
"whose sentiments were known, and who, it",8610_1.txt
"was believed, would join any organized effort.",8610_1.txt
"to lynch the negroes, were selected.",8610_1.txt
On Market street a crowd of about 100,8610_1.txt
"men were marching up and down, each with",8610_1.txt
about a foot of white cotton rope tied to,8610_1.txt
the arm. In a prominent place on the,8610_1.txt
court house is the illuminated design=,8610_1.txt
""" Wanted- 500 men to join this mob."" Up",8610_1.txt
to this writing good order has prevailed.,8610_1.txt
The mob appears to have no leader and appears,8610_1.txt
to be only watching out of curiosity,8610_1.txt
for something to turn up. The police and,8610_1.txt
"militia are determined to defend the jail,",8610_1.txt
"come what may, and if the attempt is made",8610_1.txt
there will be bloodshed sure.,8610_1.txt
The soldiers late last night were ordered,8610_1.txt
"from the armory to the jail, with a Gatling",8610_1.txt
"10,000",8610_1.txt
A crowd of fully people was,8610_1.txt
gun.,8610_1.txt
surging to and fro on Jefferson street.,8610_1.txt
Many women were seen mingling with the,8610_1.txt
crowd. All appeared to be attracted by,8610_1.txt
"curiosity only, and the best of order prevailed",8610_1.txt
.,8610_1.txt
At 12:30 a. m. the crowd about the court.,8610_1.txt
house square dwindled down to 300 or 400,8610_1.txt
"people, and they were dispersing gradually.",8610_1.txt
Three hundred and fifty soldiers with a,8610_1.txt
Gatling gun and 150 armed policemen,8610_1.txt
stood guard at the jail. The,8610_1.txt
take,8610_1.txt

"not be allowed, and there is hardly a doubt.",8610_1.txt
now that the law will be allowed to take,8610_1.txt
its course. The girl is almost certain to,8610_1.txt

"teeth, liver and heart of the victim were",8665_0.txt
"found, the balance of the body having been",8665_0.txt
consumed.,8665_0.txt
An investigation was instituted. Three,8665_0.txt
negroes were arrested. Finally one of the,8665_0.txt
"negroes gave way and confessed the crime,",8665_0.txt
implicating two other negro men and,8665_0.txt
two women. The officers secured them,8665_0.txt
and were closely guarding the prisoners,8665_0.txt
when last heard from.,8665_0.txt
The report does not give any of the details,8665_0.txt
of how the mob secured the murderers,8665_0.txt
except that they were taken by,8665_0.txt
force. A telegram from Greenville confirms,8665_0.txt
the story.,8665_0.txt
"The confession was made by Rattler,",8665_0.txt
who implicated the others. Butler Springs,8665_0.txt
is 16 miles from here. A posse of men who,8665_0.txt
had charge of the five prisoners left there,8665_0.txt
about 11 o'clock at night to bring them to,8665_0.txt
the jail here for safe keeping. The route,8665_0.txt
"was a lonely one, and the trip was necessarily",8665_0.txt
slow.,8665_0.txt
At a lonely part of the roadway the party,8665_0.txt
was suddenly surrounded about 3,8665_0.txt
"o'clock Sunday morning by armed men,",8665_0.txt
who seemed to spring up from both sides,8665_0.txt
of the road. The posse was covered by,8665_0.txt
"riflos, and under pain of instant death was",8665_0.txt
halted.,8665_0.txt
Reports say there were about 100 men,8665_0.txt
"in the attacking party, all heavily armed",8665_0.txt
and all cool and brave. They made short,8665_0.txt
work of it.,8665_0.txt
Hanged One at a Time.,8665_0.txt
"Taking the five negroes, they tied their",8665_0.txt
"hands, and then they were taken one at a",8665_0.txt

trees that lined the road. The five bodies,8665_0.txt
were found hanging there in the morning,8665_0.txt
by churchgoers.,8665_0.txt
The affair has created a great deal of excitement,8665_0.txt
"here, but it is declared there is",8665_0.txt
no doubt whatever of the guilt of all of,8665_0.txt
these victims of lynch law. There is no,8665_0.txt
disguising the fact that the majority of,8665_0.txt
the residents of the county believe the fate,8665_0.txt
of the negroes met was deserved.,8665_0.txt
There is considerable mystery as to the,8665_0.txt
cause of the murder of Watts Murphy. In,8665_0.txt
"fact, no two stories from the scene agree.",8665_0.txt
"One story is that a negro, who escaped,",8665_0.txt
concocted the plot and planned the murder,8665_0.txt
in revenge for an imaginary wrong of,8665_0.txt
a trivial nature.,8665_0.txt
The confession which implicated the,8665_0.txt
other men and women was full and explicit,8665_0.txt
. It is reported here that the mob of,8665_0.txt
lynchers was made up of the most prominent,8665_0.txt
farmers and merchants living near,8665_0.txt
"the scene of the murder, but it is believed",8665_0.txt
this is an exaggerated statement of the,8665_0.txt
"situation. There is little doubt, however,",8665_0.txt
that the prominent citizens condone the,8665_0.txt
affair.,8665_0.txt
There is some talk about the negroes being,8665_0.txt
highly wrought up over the affair.,8665_0.txt
They are especially indignant over the,8665_0.txt
hanging of the women. Whether the,8665_0.txt
women had a hand in the actual killing,8665_0.txt
"or only knew of the plot, as the negroes",8665_0.txt

"ignation. Mr. Seligman, the foreman, explained",8668_0.txt
that the jury had found its verdict,8668_0.txt
"because it did not believe the State witnesses,",8668_0.txt

The jury stood twelve for the acquittal of,8668_0.txt

"Marchesis, and Bagnetto, and nine to three",8668_0.txt

Nine of the jurors regarded with suspicion,8668_0.txt
"the three dissenting jurors, and one of them",8668_0.txt
expressed the opinion that these jurors were,8668_0.txt
"bought, for throughout the trial they expressed",8668_0.txt
their intention to bring a verdict of,8668_0.txt
"not guilty, The excitement over the verdict",8668_0.txt
"reached fever heat by night, and three or",8668_0.txt
four secret meetings were held to consider,8668_0.txt

none of the prisoners had been convicted.,8668_0.txt
Soon after the assassination of Chief Hen-,8668_0.txt

by Mayor Shakespeare to take charge,8668_0.txt
"of this case and to investigate the murder, and",8668_0.txt

similar expressions were heard on all sides.,8668_0.txt

about 5000.,8668_0.txt
"The signal to march was then given, and",8668_0.txt
away the crowd went down Royal street.,8668_0.txt
The Slaughter at the Prison.,8668_0.txt
The mob seemed determined on quiet work.,8668_0.txt
At the word of command they started toward,8668_0.txt
the parish prison at a dog trot. It was,8668_0.txt
then seen that there were three carts in the,8668_0.txt
mob in which were a number of ladders to,8668_0.txt
storm the prison if necessary. There were,8668_0.txt
also ropes with which to lynch the prisoners.,8668_0.txt
Some 200 men armed with rifles made their,8668_0.txt
appearance as men who proposed to take the,8668_0.txt
prison at any cost.,8668_0.txt
"W. S. Parkerson was the Commander, J.",8668_0.txt

"and editor of the States, Second Lieutenant.",8668_0.txt
"Around these armed men the mob surged,",8668_0.txt
some three or four thousand strong. Here,8668_0.txt
and there in the crowd was a man armed,8668_0.txt
"with a rifle or a shotgun, but the majority",8668_0.txt
had only revolvers.,8668_0.txt
When they reached the prison it was soon,8668_0.txt
seen that the men were organized as a mili-,8668_0.txt
tary body. The 200 with guns drew up in,8668_0.txt
"front of the main gate on Orleans street,",8668_0.txt
"other squads went to Treme, Marais and St.",8668_0.txt
"Anne streets, completely surrounding the",8668_0.txt

"prison, for admission. He refused, and said",8668_0.txt
that he could not surrender the keys without,8668_0.txt
the consent of the Sheriff. He called upon,8668_0.txt
the mob to disperse. His refusal was greeted,8668_0.txt
with jeers and groans.,8668_0.txt
Messengers were immediately dispatched,8668_0.txt
for axes and crowbars and picks. These,8668_0.txt
were soon procured from a neighboring,8668_0.txt
"blacksmith shop, and mob set to work",8668_0.txt
to break in the big iron the gate in front of the,8668_0.txt
"prison. It is a massive concern, and the",8668_0.txt
instruments made no impression on it. In,8668_0.txt
the mean time another squad attacked the,8668_0.txt
side Marais This,8668_0.txt
gate on street.,8668_0.txt
might easily have been defended,8668_0.txt
"by the Sheriff, but no attempt",8668_0.txt
had been made for its defence. The door,8668_0.txt
was battered with some of the beams on the,8668_0.txt
street and finally broken by a colored man,8668_0.txt
with an ax. The leaders of the mob stood at,8668_0.txt
"the door and only fifty men, the men who",8668_0.txt
"had first volunteered their services, were",8668_0.txt
"allowed to enter, the rest being kept out with",8668_0.txt
difficulty. The mob first broke into the,8668_0.txt
"visiting room, where they were halted for a",8668_0.txt
few seconds by the iron fence and railing.,8668_0.txt
A demand was made for the key of the,8668_0.txt
"gate, and a deputy sheriff presented it to one",8668_0.txt
of the men with the remark that the mob,8668_0.txt
was irresistible and it was folly to oppose it,8668_0.txt
any longer. The inside gate was thrown,8668_0.txt
"open, and the several deputies who were in",8668_0.txt
the lobby gave way to the crowd. The door,8668_0.txt
leading into the white prisoners' yard was,8668_0.txt
open and the mob crowded through.,8668_0.txt
"A cell at the door was open, and it was",8668_0.txt
"crowded with prisoners, who were trembling",8668_0.txt
in every limb. A deputy stood in the door,8668_0.txt
and informed the crowd that none of those,8668_0.txt
in that cell were the prisoners wanted. Then,8668_0.txt
"then the mob filed out into the yard, glancing",8668_0.txt
one of the cells. On the second floor,8668_0.txt

long key over his head. This announcement,8668_0.txt
was greeted with cheers. The door was,8668_0.txt
opened and the crowd made a break to get,8668_0.txt
in.,8668_0.txt
""" Hold on, gentlemen,"" said Mr. Parkerson.",8668_0.txt
""" We do not want to shed any innocent binod.",8668_0.txt

"man, and he was admitted. Seven",8668_0.txt
"men entered, and the corridor was found deserted",8668_0.txt
with the exception of one person.,8668_0.txt
This was an old colored woman.,8668_0.txt
""" Dey are up stairs, boss,"" she said, in answer",8668_0.txt
to a question. The seven men ran up,8668_0.txt
stairs. Before they got half way up a door,8668_0.txt
was slammed and footsteps were heard running,8668_0.txt
along the gallery.,8668_0.txt
""" There they are!"" yelled one enthusiast.",8668_0.txt
""" Hurrab, tiger!"" said another, and the crv",8668_0.txt
was taken up by those in the lobby. The,8668_0.txt
door leading to the gallery was thrown open,8668_0.txt
and the backs of the assassins were seen disappearing,8668_0.txt
down the winding stairway leading,8668_0.txt
into the yard of the colored female department,8668_0.txt
". Not a word was spoken then, but",8668_0.txt
a half dozen men quickly ran the length of,8668_0.txt
the gallery and quietly descended the stairs.,8668_0.txt
These six men did all the shooting. They,8668_0.txt
in the,8668_0.txt
found the prisoners crouching,8668_0.txt
woman's department. Sunseri and one of,8668_0.txt
the other Italians saved their lives in a dog,8668_0.txt
"house, where they escaped attention. Sunseri",8668_0.txt
weighs over 200 pounds but managed to,8668_0.txt
",",8668_0.txt
make himself small for this occasion. Gas-,8668_0.txt
"pardo Marchesi, the boy prisoner, was saved",8668_0.txt
"by some of the mob, who took mercy on his",8668_0.txt
tender years. He was concealed between,8668_0.txt
two mattresses. The other Italians were,8668_0.txt
scattered around the yard. When they saw,8668_0.txt
the mob they set up a yell for mercy.,8668_0.txt
"Suddenly a voice said:"" Give it to them!""",8668_0.txt
and instantly three guns and a pistol belched,8668_0.txt
forth a rain of leaden bullets.,8668_0.txt
"Gerachi, who was lame and was the last of",8668_0.txt
"the fleeing men, received one load in the",8668_0.txt
"back of the head, and, turning a complete",8668_0.txt
"somersault, fell on his face and never moved",8668_0.txt
again. Then Monasteri and Jim Caruso fell.,8668_0.txt
Their backs and heads were literally riddled,8668_0.txt
"with bullets. Romero, with a cry of anguish,",8668_0.txt
"crouched down on his knees, with his head",8668_0.txt
almost on the ground.,8668_0.txt
He was killed in that attitude. He was the,8668_0.txt
"only one who had his hat on, and, notwithstanding",8668_0.txt
"that it was riddled with bullets, it",8668_0.txt
never left his head. His black frock coat,8668_0.txt
was torn to shreds by the bullets.,8668_0.txt
The crowd on the outside heard the firing,8668_0.txt
and cheered without knowing what had been,8668_0.txt
done. Finally some one came to the door,8668_0.txt
and announced that most of the men had,8668_0.txt
"been killed, but that Macheca, Merchesi the",8668_0.txt
elder and Bagnetto would be brought from,8668_0.txt
the prison and hanged.,8668_0.txt
"It had been intended to take Macheca, who",8668_0.txt
"was regarded as the leader of the Italians,",8668_0.txt
"outside and hang him, but in the meanwhile",8668_0.txt
another section of the mob had broken into,8668_0.txt
the cell where Macheca was confined. He,8668_0.txt
"heard the men coming, rushed from his cell,",8668_0.txt
"which was open and toward the chapel, but",8668_0.txt
was finally cornered in a gallery of the condemned,8668_0.txt
prison.,8668_0.txt
Here a young man hit him over the head,8668_0.txt
"with a rifle, which made him insensible. It",8668_0.txt
"was reported that he was dead, and the crowd",8668_0.txt
was about to leave him when some one suggested,8668_0.txt
as an extra precaution that he be disposed,8668_0.txt
of. A bullet was fired through his,8668_0.txt
"brain. It being impossible to hang Macheca,",8668_0.txt
it was decided to lynch Polizzi and Bagnetto.,8668_0.txt
The mob on the outside had grown impatient,8668_0.txt
and demanded victims. The streets,8668_0.txt
"for squares around were filled with people,",8668_0.txt
among whom were a large number of women,8668_0.txt
and children. The angry crowd wanted,8668_0.txt
"vengeance on all the nineteen Italians, and",8668_0.txt
showed some opposition when it was announced,8668_0.txt
"that only four had been killed,",8668_0.txt
according to the first information,8668_0.txt
given to the mob. A loud demand,8668_0.txt
was then made that the promise to lynch,8668_0.txt
some of the prisoners should be kept. At,8668_0.txt
"11 o'clock, a few minutes after the shooting,",8668_0.txt
the side door on Marais street was,8668_0.txt
pushed open and several of the armed men,8668_0.txt
"appeared pushing before them Polizzi, the",8668_0.txt
haif- crazed Sicilian who offered to turn,8668_0.txt
"State's evidence, but who went crazy while",8668_0.txt
attempting to do so. He was aghast with,8668_0.txt
terror and was evidently mad. He was,8668_0.txt
"without coat or hat, wore a red flannel",8668_0.txt
shirt and his black hair was dishevelled.,8668_0.txt
The crowd called to the armed men to,8668_0.txt
"lynch him, and he was dragged down to the",8668_0.txt
corner of Marais and St. Anne streets.,8668_0.txt
The crowd was so dense that it was difficult,8668_0.txt
to force a passage through it. From,8668_0.txt
the balconies near men and women watched,8668_0.txt
the scene with opera glasses. At the corner,8668_0.txt
was a lamp post; some one threw a rope,8668_0.txt
across the heads of the men who were pushing,8668_0.txt
"the prisoner, and when the corner was",8668_0.txt
"reached a man scaled the post, and threw",8668_0.txt
the rope around it.,8668_0.txt
There was already a noose at the other,8668_0.txt
"end, and this was hastily and imperfectly adjusted",8668_0.txt
about the neck of the Italian Then,8668_0.txt
.,8668_0.txt
willing hands at the other end tugged at the,8668_0.txt
"line and the man was hoisted into the air,",8668_0.txt
his white face being turned toward the,8668_0.txt
"bright sky. The rope did not hold at first,",8668_0.txt
and Polizzi slipped down to the pavement.,8668_0.txt
"It was only for an instant, however.",8668_0.txt
In couple of seconds stronger hands drew,8668_0.txt
"the rope a taut, and soon the body of the un-",8668_0.txt
fortunate man was dangling from the post.,8668_0.txt
As soon as the man was high enough to make,8668_0.txt
the range of shots over the heads of the people,8668_0.txt
a dozen loud reports rang out and the,8668_0.txt
blood gushed from Polizzi's face.,8668_0.txt
Many shots had riddled his body. Then,8668_0.txt
the rope with which he had been hanged was,8668_0.txt
"wrapped securely about the post, and Poliz",8668_0.txt
zi's body was left banging.,8668_0.txt
The body was still quivering when the cry,8668_0.txt
went up that they were lynching another,8668_0.txt
man on the other side of the prison in front,8668_0.txt
"of Orleans street, whereupon the entire mot",8668_0.txt
surged in that direction. It was found that,8668_0.txt
the man who was being brought out was An-,8668_0.txt
"tonio Bagnetto, one of those acquitted.",8668_0.txt
"He was suffering from a wound, and was",8668_0.txt
"probably dead when he was lynched, or",8668_0.txt
nearly so. Two men carried him to the,8668_0.txt
"park in the centre of Orleans street, on which",8668_0.txt
are several rows of trees. Some one ascended,8668_0.txt
a tree and threw another rope around a convenient,8668_0.txt
limb. When Bagnetto was swung,8668_0.txt
up it was seen that he was shot through the,8668_0.txt
head and already dead.,8668_0.txt
"The mob wanted the others, but they were",8668_0.txt
told that enough had been done.,8668_0.txt
The whole affair occupied barely forty-,8668_0.txt
five minutes. It was 10:20 when the mob,8668_0.txt
reached the parish prison; it was 11:08 when,8668_0.txt
"Bagnetto, the last victim, was strung np.",8668_0.txt
Of the eleven men killed four had been acquitted,8668_0.txt
"by the jury, three had had a mistrial,",8668_0.txt
and four had not been tried. The mob lingered,8668_0.txt
"around the scene for some time, and",8668_0.txt
the tree to which Bagnette was hanged was,8668_0.txt
nearly cut down to carry away as momen-,8668_0.txt
tos.,8668_0.txt
Polizzi and Bagnette swung to the lamppost,8668_0.txt
"and tree until noon, when the Coroner",8668_0.txt
in an appearance and held an inquest on,8668_0.txt
put the bodies of all the victims.,8668_0.txt
The Italians Aroused.,8668_0.txt
The Italian Cabinet sent instructions by,8668_0.txt
"cable to the Italian Minister at Washington,",8668_0.txt
"Baron de Fava, to protest vehemently",8668_0.txt
against the murder of Italians in the prison,8668_0.txt
at New Orleans. Baron Fava cabled in reply,8668_0.txt
that he had presented the protest to the,8668_0.txt
"Government of the United States, and received",8668_0.txt
in reply the promise that full satisfaction,8668_0.txt
would be given.,8668_0.txt
"Governor Nichols, of Louisiana, has received",8668_0.txt
a formal protest from Secretary,8668_0.txt
Blaine deploring the killing of the eleven,8668_0.txt
"Italians, and urging him to bring the offenders",8668_0.txt
to justice.,8668_0.txt
The news from New Orleans aroused a,8668_0.txt
storm of indignation among the Italian colonies,8668_0.txt
"in Chicago, New York, Cincinnati and",8668_0.txt
Boston.,8668_0.txt
The eighty thousand Italians who comprise,8668_0.txt
the colony in New York were frenzied,8668_0.txt
by rage over the death of their countrymen,8668_0.txt
"in New Orleans by lynch law, and called",8668_0.txt
loudly for revenge.,8668_0.txt
What Led to Lynch Law.,8668_0.txt
"David C. Hennessy, Chief of the New Or-",8668_0.txt
"leans police, was shot dead near his house by",8668_0.txt
Italians on the night of last October 15. The,8668_0.txt
assassination was instigated by members of,8668_0.txt
"Italian secret societies, against which Hen-",8668_0.txt
nessy had collected evidence of the blackest,8668_0.txt
crimes. The motive was the suppression of,8668_0.txt
the information in his possession.,8668_0.txt
The history of the immediate series of,8668_0.txt
events which culminated in the murder,8668_0.txt
"dates back to last June, when a party of",8668_0.txt
Italians shot down in the street six members,8668_0.txt
of an Italian organization unfriendly to,8668_0.txt
them. Forty murders of a similar nature,8668_0.txt
had been committed by Italians in the,8668_0.txt
"city during the preceding few years,",8668_0.txt
"and the authorities, with the undivided",8668_0.txt
"support of all English- speaking citizens, determined",8668_0.txt
to make all possible efforts to stop,8668_0.txt
this incessant slaughter by the Mafia. Hen-,8668_0.txt
nessey took active charge of the resulting investigation,8668_0.txt
He did this with full knowledge,8668_0.txt
.,8668_0.txt
that his life would be in constant danger from,8668_0.txt
the moment the Mafia societies learned his,8668_0.txt
intention.,8668_0.txt
He had hardly begun his work when he,8668_0.txt
was notified by dozens of anonymous letters,8668_0.txt
that every step in his investigation was&,8668_0.txt
nail in his coffin. At the instance of his,8668_0.txt
friends he protected himself with a small,8668_0.txt
"body guard of detectives, who accompanied",8668_0.txt
him all day and took him to his house,8668_0.txt
"at night. Despite this precaution, he,",8668_0.txt
"as well as all his friends, realized",8668_0.txt
that he was constantly in imminent danger,8668_0.txt
of assassination. The June murderers,8668_0.txt
were brought into court. Six men were tried,8668_0.txt
"and convicted. Before the case was finished,",8668_0.txt
"however, the principal witness against the",8668_0.txt
by the Mafia. Then,8668_0.txt
prisoners was killed a,8668_0.txt
new trial was obtained. With renewed energy,8668_0.txt
Hennessy set about collecting more evidence,8668_0.txt
against the Stopaliagieri and other Italian,8668_0.txt
associations of assassins in the city. By taking,8668_0.txt
"advantage of a feud among the members, he",8668_0.txt
secured an immense amount of sensational information,8668_0.txt
"which, he promised, would have",8668_0.txt
weight enough to crush all the Mafia societies,8668_0.txt
in New Orleans.,8668_0.txt
His success was his death warrant. Members,8668_0.txt
of societies against which he had evidence,8668_0.txt
decided he must die.,8668_0.txt
On the evening of October 15 a gang of,8668_0.txt
hired Italian murderers concealed themselves,8668_0.txt
in a vacant house at the corner of,8668_0.txt
"an alleyway near his home. Hennessy,",8668_0.txt
unwarned left,8668_0.txt
"and unsuspicious,",8668_0.txt
"his office at the usual time, ac-",8668_0.txt
O'Connor.,8668_0.txt
companied by Police Captain,8668_0.txt
About two blocks from his house Hennessy,8668_0.txt
"bade his companion good- night, and proceeded",8668_0.txt
homeward. Although in the most,8668_0.txt
"populous part of the city, Hennessy was",8668_0.txt
alone in the street for the night was black and,8668_0.txt
"wet. He turned the corner near his house,",8668_0.txt
and came into the glare of an electric,8668_0.txt
volley flashed from the house,8668_0.txt
light. A,8668_0.txt
in the alleyway. Hennessy sank wounded,8668_0.txt
", but raised himself, drew his revolver",8668_0.txt
", and began firing back. He was answered",8668_0.txt
with scattering shots from the Italians. As,8668_0.txt
"Hennessy went down with a score of wounds,",8668_0.txt
"O'Connor, who had heard the firing, came",8668_0.txt
running up the street. The assassins ran,8668_0.txt
from the house and scattered. Three of them,8668_0.txt
in their terror threw away their firearms.,8668_0.txt
As they fled they were joined by four other,8668_0.txt
"armed men, who had waited apparently to",8668_0.txt
kill Hennessy in case he escaped the first,8668_0.txt
gang.,8668_0.txt
Hennessy was found riddled with slugs,8668_0.txt
and buckshot. He lay gasping in his blood,8668_0.txt
"at the foot of a doorstep, his revolver",8668_0.txt
At his home a,8668_0.txt
clutched in his right hand.,8668_0.txt
medical examination showed that his lungs,8668_0.txt
"and stomach had been perforated, and that",8668_0.txt
two shots had been lodged in his legs. A,8668_0.txt
bullet was also found close to his,8668_0.txt
heart. Nine other bullets had passed,8668_0.txt
rational,8668_0.txt
through his clothing. He,8668_0.txt
was,8668_0.txt
to the last but was too weak to sav more,8668_0.txt
"than that he had been killed by"" Dagos.""",8668_0.txt
Additional conclusive evidence of this fact,8668_0.txt
was found in the weapons thrown away by,8668_0.txt
fleeing assassins. All of them were,8668_0.txt
the,8668_0.txt
"sawed muskets, such as are used only by",8668_0.txt

"taken to the Supreme Court, delaying the",8711_0.txt

"down the outside door, despite the warning",8711_0.txt

They made a demand on the Sheriff for,8711_0.txt

. With the refusal they began their,8711_0.txt
advance upon the Sheriff and the few,8711_0.txt

and made an appeal for more men to get,8711_0.txt
possession of the negro. This was communicated,8711_0.txt
"also to Governor Candler, who",8711_0.txt
soon wired a proclamation to the people,8711_0.txt
of the county. It was read from the steps,8711_0.txt
of the Courthouse at 4 o'clock by the,8711_0.txt
Mayor. The Governor commanded the,8711_0.txt
people to disperse and said the entire military,8711_0.txt

The reading of the proclamation apparently,8711_0.txt
"had a good effect, as many people",8711_0.txt

LYNCH LAW arises simply from the want,8724_0.txt
"of law. It is the necessity of a people,",8724_0.txt
among whom the law is not enforced.,8724_0.txt
It is the spontaneous effort of society to,8724_0.txt
protect itself. It is the boil bursting on,8724_0.txt
"on the surface, to carry off the corrupted",8724_0.txt
blood within. Let us take some of the,8724_0.txt
"most noted cases in this country, and see",8724_0.txt
how it has acted. The hanging of the,8724_0.txt
Vicksburgh gamblers was a moral necessity,8724_0.txt
", and evidently did good. The law",8724_0.txt
was against gambling and its kindred,8724_0.txt
"atrocities, but was not enforced till the",8724_0.txt
gamblers governed the town. Property a,8724_0.txt
was no longer protected nor life secure.,8724_0.txt
"Society stepped forward, and committed",8724_0.txt

of more. If the law had been enforced,8724_0.txt
would that crime have happened? Never.,8724_0.txt

"the day, and no doubt prevented the re-",8724_0.txt
currence of that unlicensed carnival of,8724_0.txt
crime which had reigned before.,8724_0.txt
The moral of all this is evident. Men,8724_0.txt
institute government for the sole purpose,8724_0.txt
of protection. If they fail in this government,8724_0.txt
"fails, and they must resort to new",8724_0.txt

Some of our disorders may be attributed,8724_0.txt
"to political causes, but not all, nor the",8724_0.txt
greater part. For the greatest part arise,8724_0.txt
from the want of morral sentiment to enforce,8724_0.txt
the laws. The practical result of,8724_0.txt
this is the defective administration of justice,8724_0.txt
. Our legal institutions are good;,8724_0.txt
"perhaps not always wise, or prudent;",8724_0.txt

SENSATIONS AT DEATH.,8740_0.txt
The Events of a Lifetime Repeated in the,8740_0.txt
Brain at Hanging or Drowning.,8740_0.txt
In Blackwood some curious example,8740_0.txt
are given by the writer of a well,8740_0.txt
known phenomenon- the fact that the,8740_0.txt
events of a lifetime will pass some,8740_0.txt
times in a moment through the mind,8740_0.txt
of a person who is on the point of,8740_0.txt
death by drowning or suffocation.,8740_0.txt
Speaking of the death of Lord Ponson-,8740_0.txt
"by, who was hanged by the mob in",8740_0.txt
"Paris in 1791, and cut down before life",8740_0.txt
"was extinct, the author says:",8740_0.txt
He( Lord Ponsonby) proceeded to,8740_0.txt
give an account of his sensation on re,8740_0.txt
turning to consciousness. He could,8740_0.txt
not have been actually suspended in,8740_0.txt
"mid- air more than a few seconds, and",8740_0.txt
yet in that brief space of time all the,8740_0.txt
events of his past life passed through,8740_0.txt
his mind. It is true that his life to the,8740_0.txt
"date had not been a very eventful one,",8740_0.txt
"being only 19 years of age, but every",8740_0.txt
past sensation was renewed in all its,8740_0.txt
freshness. It is also remarkable that,8740_0.txt
he did not at the time experience any,8740_0.txt
"sensation of fear, while, he added, his",8740_0.txt
was an essentially nervous temper,8740_0.txt
ament.,8740_0.txt
This remarkable mental power of,8740_0.txt
calling up the past in moments of suspended,8740_0.txt
animation I have heard frequently,8740_0.txt
mentioned. One was the case,8740_0.txt
"of Count Zichy, in the revolution of",8740_0.txt
1848 in Vienna. He was caught by,8740_0.txt
"the savage mob, hung like Lord Pon-",8740_0.txt
"sonby in the middle of the street, when",8740_0.txt
his own regiment of dragoons charged,8740_0.txt
down and cut the cords as he was,8740_0.txt
swinging in the air. He fell to the,8740_0.txt
ground and was supposed to be dead:,8740_0.txt
but his recovery was a very different,8740_0.txt
"matter from Lord Ponsonby's, for he",8740_0.txt
"had suffered agonies, and for ten days",8740_0.txt
had four men constantly with him.,8740_0.txt
He describes exactly the same sensations,8740_0.txt
as Lord Ponsonby; the scroll of,8740_0.txt
what was a much longer life was unrolled,8740_0.txt
", even the smallest detail rushed",8740_0.txt
back on his memory; he had the same,8740_0.txt
"fearlessness at the moment, but he felt",8740_0.txt
all the horrors of the agony when the,8740_0.txt
danger was past.,8740_0.txt

A Review of the Recent Ku Klux Trials,8741_0.txt
-Judge Bond's Charge,8741_0.txt
"Before Judge Bond came here, or",8741_0.txt
"when he first came, we took the ground",8741_0.txt
that it was not proper to prejudge him.,8741_0.txt
Although his North Carolina career had,8741_0.txt
placed him in a very unenviable lighting,8741_0.txt
"before many of our people, yet it was,",8741_0.txt
"nevertheless, proper to observe first his",8741_0.txt
conduct here before coming to conclusions,8741_0.txt
adverse to him in his high office as,8741_0.txt
Judge. Col. MoMaster took the ground,8741_0.txt
that the juries were packed juries. All,8741_0.txt
the indications point to this as a positive,8741_0.txt
fact. It seems to us that even higher,8741_0.txt
ground may be taken. When we come,8741_0.txt
"to Judge Bond's bias, as exhibited during",8741_0.txt
"the late trials, and to his animus, as",8741_0.txt
exhibited in his pumping of the witnesses,8741_0.txt
and his reflections upon South,8741_0.txt
"Carolina, we may say, further, that",8741_0.txt
Judge Bond himself was substantially,8741_0.txt
packed. As for Messrs. Corbin and,8741_0.txt
"Chamberlain and their co- counsel, Major",8741_0.txt
"Merrill, they were also substantially",8741_0.txt
"packed. And when we come, lastly, to",8741_0.txt
"the witnesses from York, upon whose",8741_0.txt
"testimony the Government rested, that",8741_0.txt
"they were trained and packed, is also",8741_0.txt
evident to any observer..who may have,8741_0.txt
watched the progress of the trials. Thus,8741_0.txt
we hold that the whole affair was a one-,8741_0.txt
"sided, partial, packed concern, including",8741_0.txt
even one of the Judges on the bench.,8741_0.txt
The purpose was to make political matter,8741_0.txt
", at all hazards, out of Ku Kluxism.",8741_0.txt
"For this purpose, Judge Bond was sent",8741_0.txt
hither; for this purpose were Messrs.,8741_0.txt
Corbin and Chamberlain and Major Mer-,8741_0.txt
rill active and sympathetic. If the prosecution,8741_0.txt
"had a legal ruffian, so had the",8741_0.txt
bench a ruffian Judge.,8741_0.txt
"If this be treason, make the most of",8741_0.txt
"it; but if it be reason, make the most of",8741_0.txt
it also. And to think of the Attorney-,8741_0.txt

•,8741_0.txt
But let us now briefly review the Ku,8741_0.txt
Klux trials and the charge of Judge,8741_0.txt
Bond. What does the evidence show,8741_0.txt
when fairly construed? That there was,8741_0.txt
a local organization is evident that it,8741_0.txt
was for self- protection is evident- that,8741_0.txt
it resulted from Scott's arming of the,8741_0.txt
"negro militia, and the general lawlessness",8741_0.txt
"of the Counties involved, is evident-",8741_0.txt
that Lynch law was executed in some,8741_0.txt
"cases, and that unjustifiable outrages",8741_0.txt
"were also committed, is true. That all",8741_0.txt
"this was wrong, however great the provocation",8741_0.txt
", we have ever held. But admitting",8741_0.txt
"this, and regretting that any portion",8741_0.txt
of our people should ever have resorted,8741_0.txt
to secret societies as a mode of redress,8741_0.txt
"for their grievous wrongs, we yet fail to",8741_0.txt
Judge,8741_0.txt
discover,8741_0.txt
ny good reason for,8741_0.txt
"Bond's pumping of the prisoners, and",8741_0.txt
"for his infamous, unfair charge with",8741_0.txt
which he wound up his career on the,8741_0.txt
bench in the recent trials.,8741_0.txt
We are told that Judge Bond was a,8741_0.txt
leading member of the Know Nothing,8741_0.txt
organization of Baltimore. Did he,8741_0.txt
acquire his tiger- like thirst for Ku Klux,8741_0.txt
"blood in that school when, in the Monumental",8741_0.txt
"City, the foreigner had to under-",8741_0.txt
go so severe a trial? We are told that he,8741_0.txt
rose from the position of a Police Judge,8741_0.txt
to the high Federal Judgeship he now,8741_0.txt
holds Did he,8741_0.txt
. acquire in the police,8741_0.txt
court room the habit of wringing from,8741_0.txt
frightened prisoners the evidence upon,8741_0.txt
"which to fasten charges, well or ill-",8741_0.txt
"founded, upon absent persons? What",8741_0.txt
"right, we ask, has Judge Bond to question",8741_0.txt
"prisoners not under oath, and make",8741_0.txt
them submit to a sharp cross- examination,8741_0.txt
from the bench with the view of,8741_0.txt
"getting them to implicate"" prominent",8741_0.txt
"men"" and ministers of the Gospel in the",8741_0.txt
up- country. It was noticeable that,8741_0.txt
""" prominent men"" and ministers of the",8741_0.txt
Gospel were the two classes that Messrs,8741_0.txt
.,8741_0.txt
Bond and Corbin- twin ruffians- were,8741_0.txt
especially keen to get involved in the,8741_0.txt
meshes of their Ku Klux net.,8741_0.txt
And here we pause a moment to inquire,8741_0.txt
of Messrs. Corbin and Merrill as,8741_0.txt
to the result of their efforts to implicate,8741_0.txt
certain prominent Carolinians in the Ku,8741_0.txt
Klux matter,8741_0.txt
. It will be remembered,8741_0.txt
that the Columbia Union was all the,8741_0.txt
time last summer just on the point of,8741_0.txt
springing a grand mine that was to blow,8741_0.txt
up certain eminent persons. Was it because,8741_0.txt
it was thought that such men as,8741_0.txt
"Hampton, er Kershaw, or Butler were",8741_0.txt
to be found at the head of the Ku Klux,8741_0.txt
"Klan as Grand"" Cyclopes"" or"" Centres?""",8741_0.txt
And were Major Corbin and Major Mer-,8741_0.txt
rill disappointed in not being able to,8741_0.txt
"connect Hampton, or Kershaw, or Butler",8741_0.txt
with the Ku Klux organization? And,8741_0.txt
did they make in York a strenuous effort,8741_0.txt
to get those men involved?,8741_0.txt
But to return to Judge Bond's charge.,8741_0.txt
What shall be said of this judicial performance,8741_0.txt
"? This may be said with truth,",8741_0.txt
that Judge Hugh L. Bond speaks with,8741_0.txt
"the voice and spirit of the prosecutor,",8741_0.txt
although bearing the sceptre and wearing,8741_0.txt
the mantle of the Judge. Judge,8741_0.txt
Bond said that murder and rape were,8741_0.txt
not unfrequent accompaniments of the,8741_0.txt
"raids. That life was taken, and that",8741_0.txt
"outrages were committed, cannot be denied",8741_0.txt
; but that rape was a frequent ao-,8741_0.txt
"companiment, is not established by the",8741_0.txt
evidence. Besides there is reason to believe,8741_0.txt
that much that was represented as,8741_0.txt
having taken place had existence only,8741_0.txt
in the fancy of the witnesses. Whatever,8741_0.txt
"outrages were committed, we condemn",8741_0.txt
them But this is the,8741_0.txt
point,8741_0.txt
not,8741_0.txt
.,8741_0.txt
now,8741_0.txt
"The. point we now make is, that Judge",8741_0.txt
Bond's charge is predicated upon the,8741_0.txt
fact that the men who confessed acknowledged,8741_0.txt
that they had conspired against the,8741_0.txt
suffrage. This is really not the case.,8741_0.txt

"we suppose, was very much the case,",8741_0.txt

MAYOR OMAHA LYNCH TO ATTEMPT,8805_0.txt
THE attempted hanging of mayor Edward P. Smith of,8805_0.txt
"Omaha, Nebraska, by a mob that the mayor was trying",8805_0.txt
"to prevent from lynching a negro, is a new demonstration",8805_0.txt
of mass violence. In the history of lynchings there,8805_0.txt
are few instances of attacks on public officials. Police,8805_0.txt
"chiefs, sheriffs, judges and mayors, trying to prevent",8805_0.txt
lynchings usually have won their point or have been,8805_0.txt
"pushed aside, more or less respectfully. Such injuries as",8805_0.txt
they have received have commonly been accidental and,8805_0.txt
incidental.,8805_0.txt
"The stringing up of mayor Smith, therefore, showed a",8805_0.txt
greater degree of lawlessness than mobs usually are guilty,8805_0.txt
of. It was not accidental. Men can't be hanged by other,8805_0.txt
men by accident. Doubtless the governor of the state or,8805_0.txt
the judges of the state supreme court would have suffered,8805_0.txt
the same fate as the mayor of Omaha had they been in his,8805_0.txt
"place. Opposing such blind mob passion, no public official",8805_0.txt
would have stood a chance.,8805_0.txt
This incident emphasizes the temporary hatred of law,8805_0.txt
"and order which is one of the characteristics of a mob,",8805_0.txt
bent on lynching. This mob knew its intent to be murderous,8805_0.txt
and was quite cognizant of the lawlessness of its,8805_0.txt
"whole procedure, yet it was so determined to carry out its",8805_0.txt
"purpose that it was ready to kill, and did attempt to kill,",8805_0.txt
the highest public official of a big city who did no more,8805_0.txt
than try to uphold the law in accordance with the provisions,8805_0.txt
"of the law, at the dictate of his own conscience, in",8805_0.txt
"fulfillment of his sworn duty. The mob also fought, and",8805_0.txt
"was willing to kill, the police of Omaha who were also fulfilling",8805_0.txt
their sworn duty in trying to keep the negro out,8805_0.txt
"of the mob's hands, save the mayor's life and restore order",8805_0.txt
in the city.,8805_0.txt
Why did this mob break loose? Why are lynchings so,8805_0.txt
common in the United States? What shall be done to pre-,8805_0.txt
vent them?,8805_0.txt
Lynchings of negroes accused of attacks on women are,8805_0.txt
common because the acts themselves are frequent and be-,8805_0.txt
they infuriate a part of the public. Their anger is,8805_0.txt
willing cause to brook no investigation of the circumstances so,8805_0.txt
"ish accordingly, but the mere fact that there are obstacles",8805_0.txt
furnishes no reason why there should not be investigation,8805_0.txt
and punishment. Hard punishment will be a preventive,8805_0.txt
of lynchings while improvements in law enforcement following,8805_0.txt
the commission of crimes will remove much of the,8805_0.txt
rancor that finds expression in mob spirit.,8805_0.txt
"Meanwhile, this lynching at Omaha stands as one of",8805_0.txt
most disgraceful occurrences that ever blackened a,8805_0.txt
the city's name.,8805_0.txt
probably the result of the super- fury engendered in the,8805_0.txt
mob because of the nine hours' resistance which the authorities,8805_0.txt
had offered. The burning of the courthouse and,8805_0.txt
the resulting destruction of thousands of unreplaceable,8805_0.txt
records were incidental and comparatively minor acts of,8805_0.txt
lawlessness.,8805_0.txt
Lynchings into which the racial element does not enter,8805_0.txt
may be ascribed a little less to hot impulse and a little,8805_0.txt
more to impatience with the dilatory processes of the law,8805_0.txt
and the many loopholes which the law affords to unscrupulous,8805_0.txt
"lawyers to secure the liberty of defendants, however",8805_0.txt
"guilty they actually may be. Our laws, admirable in the",8805_0.txt
"main, sometimes offer technical advantages to the guilty",8805_0.txt
and sharp lawyers and easy going juries round out a combination,8805_0.txt
that can make a trial a farce and test the patience,8805_0.txt
of a justice loving public. If there were more swift,8805_0.txt
and adequate administration of justice after the commission,8805_0.txt
"of crimes, there would be fewer lynchings. This is",8805_0.txt
not a defence of lynchings but a simple statement of fact.,8805_0.txt
"Mobs often are formed, break laws and risk their own",8805_0.txt
lives in order to execute someone whom they believe to be,8805_0.txt
guilty of crime when they would not do so had they not,8805_0.txt
the uneasy feeling that otherwise the guilty might go unpunished,8805_0.txt
. We know very well that the American people,8805_0.txt
have a high regard for law and order and yet lynchings,8805_0.txt
seem to be almost unknown outside this country. Either,8805_0.txt
"we have less self restraint than other people, which we",8805_0.txt
"are loth to believe, or we have a mass of conflicting laws",8805_0.txt
whereby the guilty may profit and have profited to such,8805_0.txt
an extent that the people have been moved to take the,8805_0.txt
administration of justice out of the hands of the courts.,8805_0.txt
This is lamentable and the more so because the mobs in,8805_0.txt
"each instance have disgraced themselves, shamed their",8805_0.txt
states and cast discredit on their country in the estimation,8805_0.txt
of foreign peoples.,8805_0.txt
"As to punishment, it is hard to punish adequately because",8805_0.txt
of the difficulty of fixing blame. It usually is not,8805_0.txt
"difficult to discover the leaders, but the leaders more often",8805_0.txt
"than not merely give the mop its first impulse, like starting",8805_0.txt
a great stone rolling down hill. What happens afterward,8805_0.txt
"is usually a manifestation of mass impetus, an aggregation",8805_0.txt

"The acute conflict centered around Gastonia, does not simply express",8806_0.txt
another phase of the class struggle on the American battle front,8806_0.txt
"of world capitalism, but also symbolizes in a far reaching and significant",8806_0.txt
form events making for the emancipation of millions of oppressed,8806_0.txt
and brutally persecuted Negroes in the South.,8806_0.txt
Gastonia is merely the beginning of a series of class battles which,8806_0.txt
are destined to take place throughout the newly industrialized South.,8806_0.txt
We have already seen the workers in action in New Orleans; Eliza-,8806_0.txt
"bethton, Tennessee; Marion, North Carolina; and the various mining",8806_0.txt
sections of West Virginia. Sharper and more bitterly fought out struggles,8806_0.txt
will occur as the class consciousness of the black and white workers,8806_0.txt
of Dixie become aroused by the very nature of the intensive process,8806_0.txt
"of capitalist rationalization, which means the worsening of their present",8806_0.txt
horrible standard of living. The condition of these southern workers,8806_0.txt
represent the very lowest among the American working class. The,8806_0.txt
"primitive life which both the Negroes and poor whites are reduced to,",8806_0.txt
can only be compared with that of the colonial and semi- colonial toilers,8806_0.txt
"in China, India, Africa, the West Indies and Latin America.",8806_0.txt
It is out of these class conflicts which will sweep over the South,8806_0.txt
"with greater rapidity than most of us anticipate, that the Negro and",8806_0.txt
white workers will come to realize their class relations in the present,8806_0.txt
social order. In proportion as they recognize that despite their racial,8806_0.txt
"differences, they are both members of the proletariat, will they be able",8806_0.txt
to fight effectively in the common struggles of the working class,8806_0.txt
against the capitalist overlords. This unity of purpose will be the,8806_0.txt
most powerful force in breaking through the age long prejudices between,8806_0.txt
the workers of both races. Herein lies the greatest hopes of,8806_0.txt
the Negro masses in their struggles for self- determination. Let us not,8806_0.txt
deceive ourselves that the eradication of race prejudice will take place,8806_0.txt
"over night, but on the other hand, it must come about as a result of",8806_0.txt
the social forces propelling both groups in the same direction and,8806_0.txt
throwing them in the struggle against their class enemy- capitalism.,8806_0.txt
For years the capitalist oppressors of the South have used the,8806_0.txt
race issue as their most effective instrument to maintain their privileged,8806_0.txt
"position. Like the captalst class of czarst Rusisa, the white",8806_0.txt
ruling class of Dixie have been able until now to inflame the poor,8806_0.txt
whites against the blacks and in this way withdraw the attention of,8806_0.txt
"the workers from the class nature of society. In the czar's days, the",8806_0.txt
Russian workers and peasants were always made to believe that the,8806_0.txt
"Jewish masses were the cause for their poverty, and in this way led",8806_0.txt
"to carry out bloody pogroms against a helpless minority. Similarly,",8806_0.txt
"the Southern capitalists and their hangers- on- the preachers, politicians",8806_0.txt
", editors and teachers- have taught the white workers that their",8806_0.txt
poverty is caused by the Negroes. With this belief inculcated in the,8806_0.txt
minds of the workers it was therefore easy to incite them into lynching,8806_0.txt
mobs.,8806_0.txt
Gastonia shows that the workers will no longer be fooled by the,8806_0.txt
deceptive propaganda of their oppressors. Present events indicate the,8806_0.txt
fighting spirit of the masses.,8806_0.txt
Gastonia has already thrown to the forefront several burning,8806_0.txt
"issues. Chief among these, it has dramatized in the boldest aspect",8806_0.txt
the viciousness of the ruling class and the role of the capitalist state,8806_0.txt
during strikes. Thousands of these southern workers who only yesterday,8806_0.txt
"suffered from the illusion that the government was their"" protector",8806_0.txt
","" today are able to see for themselves that the police, the state",8806_0.txt
"militia, and other defenders of"" law and order,"" are the chief agents",8806_0.txt
of the bosses and mill owners.,8806_0.txt
"Early in 1929, the National Textile Workers' Union, a left wing",8806_0.txt
organization which grew out of the betrayals of the United Textile,8806_0.txt
"Workers' Union affiliated with the A. F. of L., and controlled by a",8806_0.txt
"group of labor fakers who style themselves the Muste"" progressives,""",8806_0.txt
"invaded the South under the leadership of Fred Beal, a stalwart trade",8806_0.txt
unionist and Communist. After a few months of preliminary work,8806_0.txt
among the workers in the Loray Mill of Gastonia a strike was called.,8806_0.txt
"Despite the betrayals of the A. F. of L. unions in the past, the workers",8806_0.txt
"goaded by the"" stretch out"" system, long hours, and starvation wages-",8806_0.txt
which hardly exceeded$ 12 for adults and$ 5 for children per week of,8806_0.txt
69 hours- responded to the appeal of the new left wing union leaders,8806_0.txt
and came out on strike. No sooner had the workers left the mills and,8806_0.txt
organized their picket lines were they confronted with the state militia,8806_0.txt
"called in to break the strike by Governor Max Gardner, a mill owner",8806_0.txt
and one of the richest men in the state.,8806_0.txt
"These Anglo- Saxon workers, who for generations have been taught",8806_0.txt
by the ruling class to consider the militia as a special force to keep,8806_0.txt
"the"" niggers"" in their place, for the first time realized that whenever",8806_0.txt
they dared to demand better conditions that they too would be shot,8806_0.txt
down like dogs alongside of the black workers.,8806_0.txt
During the course of the strike it became necessary for the union,8806_0.txt
to also organize some Negro workers employed in the mills around,8806_0.txt
"Gastonia and Bessemer City. Loyal to their program of full social,",8806_0.txt
"political and economic equality for the Negroes, the organizers immediately",8806_0.txt
began to tackle what has always been considered the most,8806_0.txt
delicate problem in the South- the organization of Negro and white,8806_0.txt
workers into the same union. The A. F. of L. has never attempted to,8806_0.txt
"undertake this task. Rather, they have always pursued the line of",8806_0.txt
"least resistance by leaving the black workers unorganized, and in the",8806_0.txt
few instances where they did organize them they set them apart in,8806_0.txt
"Jim- Crow locals. These militant trade unionists, despite their knowledge",8806_0.txt
"of the slave traditions of the South, and fully aware of the fact",8806_0.txt
that the business men and their lackeys would exploit the stand taken,8806_0.txt
"on behalf of the Negroes, nevertheless refused to surrender their positions",8806_0.txt
. Their heroism in the face of mob law and the lynching appeals,8806_0.txt
of the press will never be forgotten by the American workers. Their,8806_0.txt
courage surpassed that of the abolitionists. Their's was a mission to,8806_0.txt
emancipate not only Negroes but white workers as well from the fetters,8806_0.txt
of wage slavery.,8806_0.txt
""" The Gastonia Gazette,"" owned by the mill bosses, issued appeal",8806_0.txt
after appeal to lynch Beal and the other organizers. This paper tried,8806_0.txt

""" niggers."" who",8806_0.txt
The business men and the preachers- a class that can always be,8806_0.txt
found on the side of reaction- called upon the workers to forget the,8806_0.txt
fact that they and their families were being shot down by the gunmen,8806_0.txt
"of the mill owners, and to unite with the"" respectable"" citizens to rid",8806_0.txt
"the town of the dirty"" foreigners."" Reailzing that the appeals were",8806_0.txt
"in vain, that the workers refused to be stampeded into a lynching mob,",8806_0.txt
"the reactionary forces organized a fascist battallion called the"" committee",8806_0.txt
"of one hundred"" and set out to take the lives of the strike leaders",8806_0.txt
themselves.,8806_0.txt
"During the raid on the strike headquarters by the"" committee of",8806_0.txt
"one hundred"" headed by the police, a very significant thing happened",8806_0.txt
which in itself shows the tremendous spirit of class solidarity between,8806_0.txt
the white and the black workers which Gastonia has already brought,8806_0.txt
into being. This new attitude of class alliance was also reflected in the,8806_0.txt
speeches made by the southern delegates of the recent T.U.U.L. convention,8806_0.txt
in Cleveland.,8806_0.txt
"Otto Hall, a Negro organizer for the textile union, was on his",8806_0.txt
way from Bessemer City to Gastonia on the night of the raid in question,8806_0.txt
. The wwhite workers realizing the grave danger to which Hall,8806_0.txt
"was exposed if he happened to get into Gastonia that night, formed",8806_0.txt
a body guard and went out to meet Hall and warned him to keep away.,8806_0.txt
They met Hall two miles out of town and took him in a motor car to,8806_0.txt
Charlotte where they collected enough money among themselves to pay,8806_0.txt
his railroad fare to New York. No sooner had Hall embarked on the,8806_0.txt
train a mob broke into the house where he hid before his departure.,8806_0.txt
It was only the timely and prompt action of these white workers that,8806_0.txt
saved the life of their Negro comrade.,8806_0.txt
One can easily imagine why these fascists were so anxious to get,8806_0.txt
hold of Hall. As a Negro it would have been very easy to accuse him,8806_0.txt
"of some alleged crime and thereby"" justify"" their action of lynching",8806_0.txt
"him. After that, the class nature of the Gastonia struggle would have",8806_0.txt
been diverted into one of a racial issue leading to the wholesale lynchings,8806_0.txt
"of the white Communists, the champions of equality for the",8806_0.txt
blacks.,8806_0.txt
"The Negro workers, together with the white workers of America,",8806_0.txt
must answer this challenge of the capitalist class by mass protest action,8806_0.txt
until the revolutionary fighters now on trial at Charlotte are freed,8806_0.txt
from the clutches of the mill barons.,8806_0.txt
We can already deduct several valuable lessons from Gastonia in,8806_0.txt
relation to the working class in general and the Negro in particular.,8806_0.txt
( 1) The struggle immediately brings on the order of the day,8806_0.txt
the right of the workers to defend themselves. This must be the central,8806_0.txt
"issue for us, for as indicated, the workers will engage in more and",8806_0.txt
"more such class battles in the near future, during which fascist elements",8806_0.txt
"such as the"" committee of one hundred"" would be mobilized",8806_0.txt
"against the strikers. We cannot surrender the right of self defense,",8806_0.txt
ctherwise we will be simply inviting wholesale massacre of the working,8806_0.txt
class.,8806_0.txt
( 2) Race prejudice is not a geographical feature of American,8806_0.txt
"capitalist society. It is everywhere, although more bitterly entrenched",8806_0.txt
"in the South, because of its semi- ffeudal remnants. As the process of",8806_0.txt
industrialization proceeds and the Negroes and poor whites are drawn,8806_0.txt
from the rural communities into the industrial centers they will be,8806_0.txt
forced to discard the ideology of the past and to orientate themselves,8806_0.txt
to their new environment. This process of urbanization will bring them,8806_0.txt
together and out of these contacts they will learn to recognize that,8806_0.txt
both groups are the slaves of the bosses. They will further learn,8806_0.txt
through their everyday experiences that the employers foster race,8806_0.txt
prejudice in order to keep them apart and thereby exploit them more,8806_0.txt
easily.,8806_0.txt
( 3) The new class battles which will increasingly break out will,8806_0.txt
necessitate the application of new methods of class warfare. We have,8806_0.txt
already realized that the antiquated Jim Crow craft unions fostered,8806_0.txt
by the A. F. of L. must be displaced by new industrial unions under,8806_0.txt
the militant leadership of the Communists and the left wing T.U.E.L.,8806_0.txt
Every battle will present us with new lessons in class tactics and,8806_0.txt
methods of struggle. We must therefore be always on the alert to,8806_0.txt
recognize our weak and strong points. Rigid self- criticism must be,8806_0.txt
"indulged in, in order to immediately correct our mistakes and steel our",8806_0.txt
fighting forces so that all advantageous positions gained by the workers,8806_0.txt
will be consolidated.,8806_0.txt
( 4) A systematic ideological campaign against white chauvinism,8806_0.txt
must be carried on among the workers as well as within the Party,8806_0.txt
ranks. There is still a tremendous underestimation,8806_0.txt
of Negro work,8806_0.txt
among some of our comrades. Up till now too little serious attention,8806_0.txt
has been given to this phase of our activities • The T.U.U.L. convention,8806_0.txt
"marks a new effort, which, however, must noww end merely in",8806_0.txt
resolutions. The large Negro delegation shows tha twe are capable of,8806_0.txt
winning the black workers to our banner if we ourselves carry on,8806_0.txt
"systematic work among them. These Negro workers, as pointed out",8806_0.txt
"by the Comintern over and over again, represent revolutionary potentialities",8806_0.txt
which it will be criminal for us to neglect for the social revolution,8806_0.txt
". We must therefore intensify our work among them, and draw",8806_0.txt
them not only into the new unions but also into the ranks of the Party.,8806_0.txt
"( 5) We must popularize our slogans of full social, political, and",8806_0.txt
economic equality for Negroes more than we have done in the past.,8806_0.txt
"The most effective means of doing this is through our press, especially",8806_0.txt
"the"" Negro Champion,"" which should be developed into the mass organ",8806_0.txt
of the Negro workers. In districts and centers where large groups of,8806_0.txt
Negroes are employed especially in the centers of the basic industries,8806_0.txt
special leaflets and bulletins dealing in a concrete way with their,8806_0.txt
everyday problems should be distributed at regular intervals. The,8806_0.txt
Negro press can also be utilized to a greater extent then some of our,8806_0.txt
comrades recognize. In order to do this the Crusader News Service,8806_0.txt
should be subsidized.,8806_0.txt
Because of the peculiar position of the Negro petty- bourgeoisie and,8806_0.txt
"intellectuals, they too, are compelled to support our slogans of equality",8806_0.txt
for the Negro workers or else expose their reactionary role before the,8806_0.txt
masses. Experience has taught that these slogans of equality mean,8806_0.txt
more to the Negro working than to the black bourgeoisie and its,8806_0.txt
"middle class hangers- on, because class they already enjoy a certain privileged",8806_0.txt

assassinated the Chief of Police in the,8817_0.txt
street- shot him to death because he was,8817_0.txt
attempting to do his duty as an officer,8817_0.txt
and arrest criminals. The murderers,8817_0.txt
were arrested and tried. The evidence,8817_0.txt
was conclusive. Not a man in the United,8817_0.txt
States but believes in his breast that the,8817_0.txt
men tried were guilty. But through fear,8817_0.txt
of their lives or for money the jury failed,8817_0.txt

executed the law. When the agent,8817_0.txt
proved dishonest and faithless the principal,8817_0.txt
acted. These are the plain facts.,8817_0.txt
Eleven of an organized band of red-,8817_0.txt
handed murderers were killed. Eight of,8817_0.txt
the eleven were American citizens- at,8817_0.txt
"least, had taken the oath to support the",8817_0.txt
Constitution and laws of the United,8817_0.txt
States and the State wherein they were,8817_0.txt

to be citizens of Italy. And thus,8817_0.txt
we have the representatives of that Gov-,8817_0.txt
ernment demanding retribution and indemnity,8817_0.txt
from the United States for this,8817_0.txt
killing. And we have thousands,8817_0.txt
of men,8817_0.txt
who have taken the oath of allegiance to,8817_0.txt
"this Government, and many editors of",8817_0.txt
Italian,8817_0.txt
"papers, frantically calling on a",8817_0.txt
foreign Government to come and avenge,8817_0.txt
their countrymen- a curious proceeding,8817_0.txt
for American citizens. Mr. Blaine is,8817_0.txt
"taking a hand in the matter, and it is",8817_0.txt
attempted to make an international matter,8817_0.txt
of it.,8817_0.txt
The Italians refer to the treaty between,8817_0.txt
"the two Governments, wherein it is provided",8817_0.txt
that the citizens of Italy shall have,8817_0.txt
the same rights and privileges and be,8817_0.txt

as American citizens. Now has,8817_0.txt

or strained in the least? Not at all. Were,8817_0.txt

had the people of New Orleans selected,8817_0.txt
the three Italian citizens from the,8817_0.txt

"As it is, it is none of Italy's business,",8817_0.txt
"none of Mr. Blaine's business, but is",8817_0.txt
a matter that concerns the city of New,8817_0.txt
Orleans and the State of Louisiana alone.,8817_0.txt
"Now these eleven men were killed, not",8817_0.txt
because they were citizens of this or any,8817_0.txt
"other country, but because they were",8817_0.txt
murderers. We have made no treaty,8817_0.txt
with any foreign nation as to how these,8817_0.txt
"States will administer the laws, only that",8817_0.txt
we will treat all alike. That's what was,8817_0.txt
done in this case.,8817_0.txt
The Mafia murderers and bandits were,8817_0.txt
hunted in Italy like wild beasts. Woes,8817_0.txt
Italy demand that the United States shall,8817_0.txt
give them license to rob and murder in,8817_0.txt
the United States? That is exactly what,8817_0.txt
"this call for vengeance means, if it means",8817_0.txt
anything. The simple fact is that Ameri-,8817_0.txt
can citizenship has been made too cheap.,8817_0.txt
The United States has become the dumping,8817_0.txt
ground for the paupers and thugs of,8817_0.txt
Europe as well as some of its honest poor.,8817_0.txt
Our courts are every day making citizens,8817_0.txt
(?) of persons who do not possess a,8817_0.txt
single qualification for citizenship. And,8817_0.txt
right here let me mention the instance of,8817_0.txt
one of our own Superior Judges- Aitken,8817_0.txt
who denied the application of a person,8817_0.txt
for citizenship because it was made plain,8817_0.txt
to him that the applicant could not and,8817_0.txt
would not make a good American citizen.,8817_0.txt
Everyone in the court- room felt that the,8817_0.txt
Judge was exactly right. And if our,8817_0.txt
Judges would reject about nine out of ten,8817_0.txt
applicants they would be doing about,8817_0.txt
right. The sooner the people of these,8817_0.txt
United States meet this question- as they,8817_0.txt
must sooner or later- of organized bands,8817_0.txt

trees near the schoolhouse he saw the,8863_0.txt
body of a man hanging from a limb,8863_0.txt
and swaying back and forth. When,8863_0.txt
the doctor told of what he had seen,8863_0.txt
"the next day it settled the matter, and",8863_0.txt
the fate of the old schoolhouse was,8863_0.txt
assured.,8863_0.txt
While there has not been anything,8863_0.txt
new discovered to account for the appearance,8863_0.txt
of the ghost or the unearthly,8863_0.txt
noises that have terrified the children,8863_0.txt
"at school, there is only one belief on",8863_0.txt
"the subject, and that is that the uncanny",8863_0.txt
object is the ghost of Amer,8863_0.txt
Green. On a walnut,8863_0.txt
tree in the vicinity,8863_0.txt
of the schoolhouse some years,8863_0.txt
ago Amer Green was strung up by,8863_0.txt
lynch law and his body left hanging,8863_0.txt
there. In view of the appearance of,8863_0.txt
the ghost so frequently and its apparent,8863_0.txt
"inability to rest, the community is",8863_0.txt
now beginning to take some stock in,8863_0.txt
Amer's dying declaration that he was,8863_0.txt
innocent of the crime for which he was,8863_0.txt
"lynched ,, and that he will never rest",8863_0.txt
in his grave until his innocence is,8863_0.txt
made plain.,8863_0.txt
Amer Green was known in the neighborhood,8863_0.txt
"as a"" terror"" and was a generally",8863_0.txt
notorious character.,8863_0.txt
He was,8863_0.txt
"an admirer of Luella Mabbit, the",8863_0.txt
"daughter of William Mabbit, a well-",8863_0.txt
to- do farmer living near Young America,8863_0.txt
", thirteen miles northeast of here.",8863_0.txt
Mabbit did not approve of the intimacy,8863_0.txt
"of his daughter with Green, and at his",8863_0.txt
command the girl wrote her admirer,8863_0.txt
a letter requesting that he abandon,8863_0.txt
his suit for her hand.,8863_0.txt
Such a request did not suit the impetuous,8863_0.txt
"nature of Green, who became",8863_0.txt
greatly enraged at the girl's letter and,8863_0.txt
made numerous threats of what he,8863_0.txt
"would do. August 19, 1886, Green, in",8863_0.txt
"company with William Walker, called",8863_0.txt
at the Mabbit house in the evening.,8863_0.txt
and asked to see Luella. Her sister,8863_0.txt
"Cynthia, now Mrs. Walker, went to",8863_0.txt
the door and told Green that Luella,8863_0.txt
had gone to bed and did not wish to,8863_0.txt
"get Jp Green raved at hearing this,",8863_0.txt
and finally. Luella got up and dressed,8863_0.txt
and she and Green went out together.,8863_0.txt
Cynthia went to bed and there was no,8863_0.txt
one else in the house who knew that,8863_0.txt
Luella and Green had gone out together,8863_0.txt
.,8863_0.txt
That was the last seen of Luella,8863_0.txt
Mabbit alive. When she did not return,8863_0.txt
"home a search was made for her,",8863_0.txt
but no trace could be found. Green,8863_0.txt
was arrested on the charge of murder,8863_0.txt
and placed in jail at Delphia. Almost,8863_0.txt
"six months afterward, on February 5,",8863_0.txt
"1887, the body of a woman W33",8863_0.txt
fished out of the rive some tailes below,8863_0.txt
"Lafayette, and some of the relatives",8863_0.txt
of the girl recognized the corpse,8863_0.txt
as that of Luella. There were doubts,8863_0.txt
"then, and always have been since, a:",8863_0.txt
to the value of the identification. When,8863_0.txt
the Coroner's jury held an inquest on,8863_0.txt
the body picked cut of the river the,8863_0.txt
verdict was that it was the body of,8863_0.txt
"Luella Babbit, and that she came to",8863_0.txt
her .nd at the hands of Green. He was,8863_0.txt
"held for the crime, but the State officials",8863_0.txt
found so much diflculty in,8863_0.txt
tracing his movements the night he,8863_0.txt
had gone out with Luella that the trial,8863_0.txt
was put off time and again in order,8863_0.txt
that they might make out a case,8863_0.txt
against him.,8863_0.txt
This delay was not understood or ap.,8863_0.txt
"preciated by the community, which",8863_0.txt
was terribly aroused over the disappearance,8863_0.txt
"of the girl, and was fearful",8863_0.txt
"that her abductor and murderer, as",8863_0.txt
"they judged Green to be, might escape",8863_0.txt
punishment on some technicality.,8863_0.txt
"It was resolved that Green, must die.",8863_0.txt
About 10 o'clock on the night of,8863_0.txt
"October 21, 1887, a mob surrounded",8863_0.txt
the jail at Delphia and called on the,8863_0.txt
sheriff for the keys. When he refused,8863_0.txt
to give them up the mob attacked the,8863_0.txt
jail with cold chisels and sledge hammers,8863_0.txt
", and socn forced an entrance.",8863_0.txt
"Green was taken out, placed in a wagon",8863_0.txt
"with a guard, and then the mob",8863_0.txt
"climbed in to their vehicles, which",8863_0.txt
"were standing around, and the procession",8863_0.txt
came up its route to Walnut,8863_0.txt
Grove.,8863_0.txt
When they got there Green was confronted,8863_0.txt
"with Mr. Mabbit, and to the",8863_0.txt
latter's question as to what he had,8863_0.txt
done with Luella swore that the girl,8863_0.txt
was alive and well and was then living,8863_0.txt
"at Fort Wayne, Tex. Mr. Mabbit",8863_0.txt
and the mob were of the opinion that,8863_0.txt
this was a lie and was told for the,8863_0.txt
"purpose of gaining time, so without",8863_0.txt
any more parley the rope that had,8863_0.txt
been brought along was placed around,8863_0.txt
Green's neck and the other end thrown,8863_0.txt
"around the limb of a tree, and in a few",8863_0.txt
moments Green was a corpse. He protested,8863_0.txt
his innocence to the last mo-,8863_0.txt
"apment, and at no time exhibited the",8863_0.txt
least trace of fear except at the expression,8863_0.txt
of a wish on the part of some,8863_0.txt
"of the mob to burn him, and then he",8863_0.txt
"begged them to"" Kill him like a man,""",8863_0.txt
and not to torture him.,8863_0.txt
In explanation of his movements,8863_0.txt
with Luella Mabbit on the night they,8863_0.txt
went away together Green said that,8863_0.txt
he and the girl had planned to elope,8863_0.txt
and had gone from the Mabbit house,8863_0.txt
"to Frankfort, where they separated,",8863_0.txt
Luella going to Indianapolis. while,8863_0.txt
Green went to Kokomo for money and,8863_0.txt
they met in Indianapolis the day following,8863_0.txt
. From there Luella had gone,8863_0.txt
"to Texas, while he had returned home",8863_0.txt
to settle up some affairs preparatory,8863_0.txt
to joining her.,8863_0.txt
In the meantime the people of Walnut,8863_0.txt
Grove are satisfied that Green's,8863_0.txt
"spirit is walking the earth, and that it",8863_0.txt
will never rest until the mystery of,8863_0.txt
Luella Mabbit's fate is effectually,8863_0.txt
cleared up. But he has driven them,8863_0.txt
out of their schoolhouse and forced,8863_0.txt
"the board to build them a new one,",8863_0.txt
and this is undoubtedly the first time,8863_0.txt

is said he is charged with having been,8870_0.txt
a party to the lynching. The police officials,8870_0.txt

he deplores the lynching of White and,8870_0.txt
its consequent reflection upon the good,8870_0.txt
name of Delaware. Judge Grubb also,8870_0.txt
explained the action of the court in refusing,8870_0.txt
to call a special session of the,8870_0.txt
grand jury for the indictment of Miss,8870_0.txt
Bishop's murderer. He says the trial,8870_0.txt
would have been attended by such public,8870_0.txt
clamor and prejudice that a fair,8870_0.txt

during the day of the contemplated attack,8870_0.txt
and thirty policemen in charge of,8870_0.txt
Chief Black and Captains Evans and,8870_0.txt
Kane went to the work house. There,8870_0.txt
were several thousand persons at the,8870_0.txt
prison at that time and the officers,8870_0.txt
were powerless against such large numbers,8870_0.txt
so they entered the building to assist,8870_0.txt
the guards in an effort to protect,8870_0.txt
the prisoner.,8870_0.txt
The leaders of the mob were cool and,8870_0.txt
determined. Warden Meserve told them,8870_0.txt
White was in cell 13 in the third story,8870_0.txt
in order to prevent unnecessary destruction,8870_0.txt
of property. He told the,8870_0.txt
leaders how to disconnect the ceil,8870_0.txt
door.,8870_0.txt
NEGRO FOUGHT FOR LIFE.,8870_0.txt
White fought desperately for his life,8870_0.txt
in the little iron cage cell and knocked,8870_0.txt
down the first man who approached,8870_0.txt
him. The leaders again showed their,8870_0.txt
"clear headedness and one of them, a",8870_0.txt
powerful man stepped forward before,8870_0.txt
anyone could strike the prisoner and,8870_0.txt
threw his arms around the frightened,8870_0.txt
"wretch, thus protecting him from violence",8870_0.txt
. The lawn in front of the prison,8870_0.txt
was a sea of faces when viewed,8870_0.txt
from the porch. White's custodian became,8870_0.txt
convinced that unless strategy,8870_0.txt
was used there would be little chance,8870_0.txt
of getting their man to the spot on,8870_0.txt
"Price's road, where it was planned that",8870_0.txt
the negro should be burned to death.,8870_0.txt
This danger was overcome by a quiet,8870_0.txt
order to extinguish lanterns or keep,8870_0.txt
them concealed. In the darkness there,8870_0.txt
was a confused rush and after this no,8870_0.txt
one seemed to know where the prisoner,8870_0.txt
was.,8870_0.txt
At the stake White's nerve seemed to,8870_0.txt
be good and he held his head up while,8870_0.txt
he addressed the crowd. He made another,8870_0.txt
confession and appealed to God,8870_0.txt
for then,8870_0.txt
mercy rope was,8870_0.txt
. A strong,8870_0.txt
brought and the negro was wrapped,8870_0.txt
in its coils from shoulders to feet. His,8870_0.txt
mouth was working while this was going,8870_0.txt
on and he seemed to be trying to,8870_0.txt
finish his statement. The crowd was in,8870_0.txt
a hurry to get through with its gruesome,8870_0.txt
task and called out for the executioners,8870_0.txt
to hasten. When the rope had,8870_0.txt
been adjusted the negro was fastened,8870_0.txt
to the stake and the torch was applied,8870_0.txt
to the straw.,8870_0.txt
The flames leaped up and licked the,8870_0.txt
man's bare hands. He was held erect,8870_0.txt
by one of the lynchers until his clothing,8870_0.txt
"was burning fairly, when he was",8870_0.txt
pushed into the middle of the fire. He,8870_0.txt
rolled about and his contortions were,8870_0.txt
"terrible, but he made no sound. Suddenly",8870_0.txt
the ropes on his legs parted and,8870_0.txt
he sprang from the fire and started to,8870_0.txt
run. A man struck him in the head,8870_0.txt
with a piece of fence rail and knocked,8870_0.txt
Willing hands threw him,8870_0.txt
him down.,8870_0.txt
again into the flames. He rolled out,8870_0.txt
"several times, but was promptly returned",8870_0.txt
. While this was going on shouts,8870_0.txt
from the,8870_0.txt
cheers and jibes went,8870_0.txt
crowd. up,8870_0.txt

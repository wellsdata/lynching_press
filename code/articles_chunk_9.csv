HISTORY OF THE CRIME.,19607_0.txt
The crime for which Bell suffered was,19607_0.txt
on the 4th of last December. J.,19607_0.txt
"committed H. Bell and his victim, F. G. Small, were",19607_0.txt
both practicing attorneys in the town of,19607_0.txt
"Harrold. Small was very popular, and last",19607_0.txt
fall he received the Republican nomination,19607_0.txt
for prosecuting attorney in Hughes county.officers,19607_0.txt
This created a jealousy between,19607_0.txt
the and Bell concocted a,19607_0.txt
"men,",19607_0.txt
scheme Small from the,19607_0.txt
to remove,19607_0.txt
town with the view of monopolizing the,19607_0.txt
law business of the district. In order to,19607_0.txt
carry out his scheme he took into his confidence,19607_0.txt
"one Ferdinand Bennett, at that time",19607_0.txt
in his employ. On the 4th of last Decem,19607_0.txt
ber Small left Harrold on his pony for,19607_0.txt
Blunt to attend a lawsuit and hearing of,19607_0.txt
this Bell and Bennett started after him in,19607_0.txt
a buggy. When they overtook Small Bell,19607_0.txt
asked him how much he would take to settle,19607_0.txt
a suit for$ 16 then pending between,19607_0.txt
them. Small told him he would settle it,19607_0.txt
for just the exact amount. Bell told him,19607_0.txt
he would give him$ 15 and Small said he,19607_0.txt
would never quarrel with a man over a dollar,19607_0.txt
and Bell asked him to get off his pony,19607_0.txt
and write out an agreement. While Small,19607_0.txt
was writing on the buggy cushion Bell,19607_0.txt
stepped up behind him and pulled out,19607_0.txt
of his overcoat pocket a small,19607_0.txt
hatchet and struck Small in the back,19607_0.txt
"of his neck, and buried the hatchet so that",19607_0.txt
it could not be seen. After pulling it out,19607_0.txt
he struck him once or twice more and Bell,19607_0.txt
and Bennett then lifted the corpse into the,19607_0.txt
buggy. After driving around for two or,19607_0.txt
three miles they came to some breaking,19607_0.txt
"four miles north of Harrold, where they",19607_0.txt
dug a hole about two feet deep with a spade,19607_0.txt
"which Bell had in the buggy, and then",19607_0.txt
chucked the body in. They drove back to,19607_0.txt
"Harrold, and on the next day Bell went to",19607_0.txt
"Huron, and to further the idea that Small",19607_0.txt

with the prisoners. Then he opened,19625_0.txt

to march out the six condemned men.,19625_0.txt
One Man Tries to Escape.,19625_0.txt
They were walked to the place for,19625_0.txt
the execution with ropes around their,19625_0.txt
necks. The mob caught them in a circle,19625_0.txt
", and there was little excitement, except",19625_0.txt
on the part of the victims. They,19625_0.txt
cursed and prayed alternately and also,19625_0.txt
kept asserting they were innocent.,19625_0.txt
When any one of them dropped back,19625_0.txt
or hesitated in the march he was driven,19625_0.txt

all together. Six ropes had been thrown,19625_0.txt

was so sure of itself that the negroes,19625_0.txt

Judge Wolfe's Just Charge,19839_0.txt
to the Grand Jury.,19839_0.txt
In his charge to the grand jury,19839_0.txt
Monday Judge J. Emmet Wolfe was,19839_0.txt
outspoken in reprobating the Pensa,19839_0.txt
cola mob which lynched the negro,19839_0.txt
Dave Alexander on the morning of,19839_0.txt
April 5th. His language was strong,19839_0.txt
and should prove effective in arousing,19839_0.txt
the jury to a sense of its obligation,19839_0.txt
to make a thorough investigation into,19839_0.txt
"the outrage, and, so far as possible,",19839_0.txt
relieve their city and county from the,19839_0.txt
stigma now resting upon them.,19839_0.txt
Judge Wolfe struck the very core,19839_0.txt
of the problem when he declared that,19839_0.txt
a mob's vengeance upon a criminal,19839_0.txt
worked comparatively but little injury,19839_0.txt
"to the victim but, by defying the",19839_0.txt
"law, did incalculable harm to the",19839_0.txt
"community. For how slight, after",19839_0.txt
"all, is the punishment inflicted by",19839_0.txt
"death. It is as natural and, in the",19839_0.txt
"last analysis, as painless to die as to",19839_0.txt
be born. The few brief moments of,19839_0.txt
suffering before unconsciousness,19839_0.txt
comes to the struggling victim are,19839_0.txt
soon passed then comes absolute re,19839_0.txt
lief from physical pain. As a matter,19839_0.txt
of fact a criminal is made to suffer,19839_0.txt
for more if left to the necessary delays,19839_0.txt
of a legal prosecution; to long,19839_0.txt
and dreary hours in a lonely cell,19839_0.txt
where he must bare his conscience,19839_0.txt
before his God; to the horrifying,19839_0.txt
words of the death sentence; then the,19839_0.txt
"death watch, the solemn procession",19839_0.txt
to the gallows and the final launch,19839_0.txt
into eternity.,19839_0.txt
But it is very different with respect,19839_0.txt
to the community. Every lawless act,19839_0.txt
brings a reproach upon it; paints it,19839_0.txt
black to the eyes of all outsiders;,19839_0.txt
gives opportunity for its enemies to,19839_0.txt

THE DOCTRINE OF JUDGE LYNCH.,19934_0.txt
"The Independent, in its issue of the",19934_0.txt
"29th of last month, contained a short",19934_0.txt
"editorial entitled"" The Remedy of",19934_0.txt
"Lynching."" The occasion for writing",19934_0.txt
the editorial was the lynching of Nell-,19934_0.txt
"ing, in Indiana, the self- confessed",19934_0.txt
murderer of Miss Ida Atkinson. The,19934_0.txt
jail in which Nelling was confined,19934_0.txt
"was broken into by a lawless mob,",19934_0.txt
and he was summarily taken from the,19934_0.txt
hands of the law and then hanged,19934_0.txt
to the limb of a tree. The Independent,19934_0.txt
characterized this deed as an act of,19934_0.txt
"murder, and called upon the authorities",19934_0.txt
of Indiana to use the utmost diligence,19934_0.txt
to bring the murderers to jus-,19934_0.txt
tice in the way that the law prescribes.,19934_0.txt
"This"" remedy for lynching"" has",19934_0.txt
brought out two responses from regular,19934_0.txt
"readers of the Independent, in both",19934_0.txt
of which the writers not only protest,19934_0.txt
"against the remedy, but denounce lawyers",19934_0.txt
", jurors and judges because crimi-",19934_0.txt
uals who ought to be hanged so often,19934_0.txt
escape the punishment they deserve.,19934_0.txt
"It is, however, necessary, in the interests",19934_0.txt
"of justice, for Judge Lynch now",19934_0.txt
and then to hold his court and supplement,19934_0.txt
the regular administration of law,19934_0.txt
and thus the more effectually teach,19934_0.txt
the criminal classes that they must,19934_0.txt
not violate the law. Nelling's case is,19934_0.txt
referred to as a pertinent illustration,19934_0.txt
of this doctrine. The men who took,19934_0.txt
him from jail and hanged him by the,19934_0.txt
"neck were not, in the judgment of",19934_0.txt
"these correspondents, murderers, but",19934_0.txt
"rather"" deserve the thanks of all good",19934_0.txt
They gave Nelling just what,19934_0.txt
11,19934_0.txt
men.,19934_0.txt
"his crime merited, but what he might",19934_0.txt
possibly have escaped but for their,19934_0.txt
timely and patriotic interference,19934_0.txt
This is the gist of what both of these,19934_0.txt
writers have to say on the subject.,19934_0.txt
"We confess to them very frankly,",19934_0.txt
"and to all others of like mind, that",19934_0.txt
we still hold the opinion already expressed,19934_0.txt
in regard to the nature of the,19934_0.txt
"act, and also as to the proper remedy",19934_0.txt
for preventing the repetition of such,19934_0.txt
acts. Murder is carefully defined by,19934_0.txt
"the laws of Indiana, as well as by",19934_0.txt
those of other States; and killing men,19934_0.txt
"by lynching, comes, beyond all ques-",19934_0.txt
"tion, within the meaning of the definition",19934_0.txt
. Such killing is deliberate and,19934_0.txt
"intentional killing, and that, too,",19934_0.txt
"without the authority of law, and indeed",19934_0.txt
", against its authority. The participants",19934_0.txt
"in the killing are, by the",19934_0.txt
"rule of law, murderers; and if the",19934_0.txt
"law is right, as we believe it is, then",19934_0.txt
every one of these participants ought,19934_0.txt
to be dealt with as the law directs.,19934_0.txt
This is what we said in the editorial,19934_0.txt
referred to; and it is what we say now,19934_0.txt
"Judge Lynch is simply a murderer, no",19934_0.txt
matter what may be the character of,19934_0.txt
the man he murders. He kills with-,19934_0.txt
out any authority for so doing; he,19934_0.txt
does it by design and intention; and,19934_0.txt
"this is murder, whether perpetrated by",19934_0.txt
a single individual or by a mob of one,19934_0.txt
hundred and fifty persons. The fact,19934_0.txt
"that a mob does the killing, and that",19934_0.txt
"the man killed is himself a murderer,",19934_0.txt
does not change the character of the,19934_0.txt
action at all. The law forbids this,19934_0.txt
"kind of killing, as it ought to do, and",19934_0.txt
as it must do in order to protect hn-,19934_0.txt
"man society, and provides a punishment",19934_0.txt
for it; and hence the only proper,19934_0.txt
way of dealing with Judge Lynch,19934_0.txt
"is to treat him as a felon, and, after",19934_0.txt
"trial and conviction, hang him by the",19934_0.txt
neck till he is dead. A few examples,19934_0.txt
of this character would put an end,19934_0.txt
alike to this doctrine and the practice,19934_0.txt
of it.,19934_0.txt
"Lynching, moreover, is the very",19934_0.txt
worst of all possible remedies for alleged,19934_0.txt
defects in the regular administration,19934_0.txt
of law. It is a thousand times,19934_0.txt
worse than the evil which it proposes,19934_0.txt
to correct. Let it be granted that,19934_0.txt
"criminals, in the process of regular",19934_0.txt
"trial, sometimes escape the punishment",19934_0.txt
which they deserve. This is undoubtedly,19934_0.txt
a fact; and yet it is far better,19934_0.txt
that they should escape than that,19934_0.txt
a mob of lynchers should take justice,19934_0.txt
into its hands and attempt maintain,19934_0.txt
law by most outrageously to violating,19934_0.txt
law. The evil in the latter case is,19934_0.txt
"immensely greater than in the former,",19934_0.txt
since it for the time being displaces,19934_0.txt
and practically repeals all law except,19934_0.txt
that which the lynchers themselves,19934_0.txt
choose to establish. It is the lawless,19934_0.txt
action of a comparatively few men-,19934_0.txt
certainly far less than the whole community,19934_0.txt
- who generally disguise them,19934_0.txt
selves that they may not be recognized,19934_0.txt
", and who, without a particle of",19934_0.txt
"authority, without the form of law,",19934_0.txt
without hearing evidence and without,19934_0.txt
giving any opportunity for a plea,19934_0.txt
"defense, seize their victim under the of",19934_0.txt
"naked law of brute force, and summarily",19934_0.txt
"put him to death, and at the",19934_0.txt
same time defy and overcome all the,19934_0.txt
agencies of law that may be called,19934_0.txt
into action for his protection against,19934_0.txt
lawless violence. It is the most abominable,19934_0.txt
"and horrible tyranny, because",19934_0.txt
"the physical force of a mass of men,",19934_0.txt
unregulated by any law but their own,19934_0.txt
"passions, is brought to bear against",19934_0.txt
the life of one man. He might,19934_0.txt
well be thrown into a den of hungry,19934_0.txt
tigers. The spectacle of Judge Lynch,19934_0.txt
executing law is not one whit above,19934_0.txt
"the lowest barbarism, where men kill",19934_0.txt
each other whenever they wish to do,19934_0.txt
"so, just as beasts of prey destroy the",19934_0.txt
lives of the animals on which they,19934_0.txt
feed.,19934_0.txt
Civilized society can never take,19934_0.txt
Judge Lynch into partnership with itself,19934_0.txt
as an auxiliary to the ends for,19934_0.txt
which it exists. It must get rid of,19934_0.txt
Judge Lynch; and the way to do so is,19934_0.txt
"not to condone his offenses, and not to",19934_0.txt
as a,19934_0.txt
him as a felon. Let Judge Lynch understand,19934_0.txt
that when he assumes to,19934_0.txt
"make and execute the law, to try",19934_0.txt
causes and hang those whom he condemns,19934_0.txt
", good citizens will not only not",19934_0.txt
"applaud him, but will use their utmost",19934_0.txt
efforts to have him brought to justice,19934_0.txt
"in the way the law prescribes, and",19934_0.txt
"then, our word for it, Judge Lynch",19934_0.txt
will stop business. We know of no,19934_0.txt
other sufficient or safe way of dealing,19934_0.txt
with him. We know of no tyrant,19934_0.txt
more to be dreaded than this selfsame,19934_0.txt
Judge Lynch. His reign is the,19934_0.txt
ruin of law and substitution of brute,19934_0.txt
force. Whatever may be the failures,19934_0.txt
of civil society in the administration,19934_0.txt

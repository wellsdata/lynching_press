attributable to the lynch law. Carefully considering the status of,90635_0.txt
the ex- slave and searching into reasons which have been given to,90635_0.txt

it can be seen without tedious investigation that his efforts have been,90635_0.txt
"thwarted, his life thrown into constant and continual jeopardy and",90635_0.txt
his property holdings intimidated by the ever- present spectre of the,90635_0.txt

"During the last election when"" the men of the night"" sought to",90635_0.txt
"exercise their right of ballot, many were murdered, some brow- beaten",90635_0.txt

ished and children thrown into panic- stricken frenzy. The lynchers,90635_0.txt
"of Florida, Georgia and Alabama hurled the fear of death with great",90635_0.txt
agony and terrible horror into the souls of black folks. The use of,90635_0.txt
the ballot is the inevitable means of political expression for American,90635_0.txt
citizens. This is denied and refused to black people. The denial and,90635_0.txt
refusal is enforced by lynchings or threats which signify the same.,90635_0.txt
The Ku Klux Klan carries its silent and sinister warning and like the,90635_0.txt
"pirate's flag, embellished with skull and bones, its emblems scream",90635_0.txt
of death and disaster to black people. It follows that unless the,90635_0.txt
evils of unmolested outlawry are corrected that the political future,90635_0.txt
of the freed man will continue in its unsatisfactory and precarious,90635_0.txt
condition.,90635_0.txt
The economic background behind lynching is discernible even,90635_0.txt
It cannot be hidden or disguised. The,90635_0.txt
to the people across the sea.,90635_0.txt
lynch law has destroyed black men for having wealth and has even,90635_0.txt
been extended to fit the case of those who sought to get it. We,90635_0.txt
know men of our race who have been lynched for having bought,90635_0.txt
comfortable homes. We know others who have been driven from,90635_0.txt
their estates and their possessions seized and confiscated. Openly,90635_0.txt
and notoriously technical slavery and practical peonage is conducted,90635_0.txt
in the south with impunity. The labor of the black man has been,90635_0.txt
made profitable not for himself but for the lynch lords. It was the,90635_0.txt
lynch law which kept many of us from leaving the south and securing,90635_0.txt
healthy employment in the essential industries of the north. Men are,90635_0.txt
still denied free ingress and egress between the separate states. The,90635_0.txt

and entirely curtails economic prowess of the dusky,90635_0.txt

Calling for a Conclave,90635_0.txt
"Reviewing the lynchings of 1920, the causes and effects, it can",90635_0.txt
be concluded without hesitation or fears for error that the great evil,90635_0.txt
that confronts the black man of America is the unmitigated outlawry,90635_0.txt
"of certain citizens living to a large extent in the south. For emphasis,",90635_0.txt
we repeat that the evil of lynching is the paramount hindrance to the,90635_0.txt

"leaders naturally offered different programs, but there is one common",90635_0.txt
"point upon which all leaders and"" would- be leaders"" can agree, and",90635_0.txt
that is that the lynch law is the Nemesis and barrier in the pathway,90635_0.txt
of their people. A new administration now stands upon the threshold,90635_0.txt
of the executive offices of the nation. It is necessary and expedient,90635_0.txt
for black people to agree upon a definite plan and program for the,90635_0.txt
destruction of their arch enemy. It is agreed that a federal law,90635_0.txt

The Lynching Commission.,90636_1.txt
Senator Medill McCormick of Illinois has introduced a bill in,90636_1.txt
"Congress providing for a"" Commission on Lynching."" Those who",90636_1.txt
are to compose the membership of this Commission are to be ap-,90636_1.txt
pointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate.,90636_1.txt
Specific task of this body is clearly defined in Section 5 of the Bill:,90636_1.txt
""" The Commission shall conduct a general inquiry into the sub-",90636_1.txt
ject of mob violence and lynching in the United States. It shall in-,90636_1.txt
clude the number of lynchings which have taken place within the,90636_1.txt
past twenty years and the causes thereof. It shall also consider and,90636_1.txt
report its conclusions in respect to the adequacy of the means now,90636_1.txt
employed for the prevention of mob violence and lynching and the,90636_1.txt
"remedies available for their avoidance."" Another significant feature",90636_1.txt
of the McCormick Commission is the fact that it will be endowed,90636_1.txt
with power to summon whomsoever it may choose to testify on the,90636_1.txt
subject of lynching.,90636_1.txt
It is almost a dead certainty that this bill will unanimously pass,90636_1.txt
both houses in Congress. Senator McCormick like many other,90636_1.txt
thinking men of the white race is beginning to realize that the lynching,90636_1.txt
evil and kindred crimes are developing the most serious problems,90636_1.txt
of the age. Perpetrators of this crime have almost invariably gone,90636_1.txt
unpunished. As a result a natural contempt for all law has been,90636_1.txt
inspired. This is especially true when the statutes do not suit their,90636_1.txt
fancy and immediate convenience. The conduct of the South during,90636_1.txt
the late war is a striking example of the growth of a disregard for,90636_1.txt
Federal Statutes. In certain districts the draft boards refused to,90636_1.txt
function. Needless millions were necessitated to carry on persuasive,90636_1.txt
propaganda. And yet hundreds of lives of Federal agents had to,90636_1.txt
be sacrificed in order to command a fair respect for the draft law.,90636_1.txt
The gravity of the lynching evil is rendered more serious by the,90636_1.txt
attitude of the American black man. He has been denied the protection,90636_1.txt
"of life. His accumulations are not secured. In fact, he has",90636_1.txt
been deprived of all the commendable objects of pursuit recognized,90636_1.txt
as essential in any satisfactory economic order. The government's,90636_1.txt
failure to take official notice of these unjust and fuedalistic practices,90636_1.txt
has caused the black man to lose confidence in the integrity of official,90636_1.txt
"America. Thousands of black men who today would be, and should",90636_1.txt
"be, productive economic factors have joined the ranks of the idle",90636_1.txt
and shiftless. A more dangerous type have concluded that justice,90636_1.txt
so far as they are concerned is conditioned upon the accuracy of their,90636_1.txt
aim and the weight of their blows. Recent racial clashes throughout,90636_1.txt
nation bear this out without need of further argument.,90636_1.txt
the This country has many titanic international questions to con-,90636_1.txt
front. The most optimistic among us do not doubt that the settlement,90636_1.txt
may require conflict. The fidelity of fifteen million cannot be,90636_1.txt
ignored in such a crisis. Unofficial organizations have collected a,90636_1.txt
lot of data on lynching. They had to take such data as was handed,90636_1.txt
to them by those who either committed the crime or were in sympathy,90636_1.txt
with it. When a Federal Commission backed up by the,90636_1.txt
Army and Navy goes into the bowels of Dixie and assures those who,90636_1.txt
have been victims of the crime that they will be immune from molestation,90636_1.txt
", new and startling disclosures will be made on the subject.",90636_1.txt
We are of the opinion that when this expose has been made and the,90636_1.txt
whole truth is placed before the American people in its nudeness,90636_1.txt
that public sentiment will be immediately organized to obliviate this,90636_1.txt
crime. Senator McCormick should be congratulated by the whole,90636_1.txt
"nation for his farsightedness. He is not only doing, the black man",90636_1.txt
"favor but the nation a service, a",90636_1.txt

A day or two later the coroner summoned,90673_0.txt
"a jury, the evidence of the cause",90673_0.txt
of the negro's death was produced and,90673_0.txt
the jury rendered the following verdict,90673_0.txt
:,90673_0.txt
""" We, the jury, find that Tom Jones",90673_0.txt
came to his death by gunshot wounds,90673_0.txt

and,90673_0.txt

have been recreant to their duty as,90673_0.txt

"wise.""",90673_0.txt
Such incidents as this nullify volumes,90673_0.txt
of sermonizing by southern papers on,90673_0.txt
the text of northern misunderstanding,90673_0.txt
and misrepresentation of southern sen-,90673_0.txt
It is,90673_0.txt
timent on the race problem.,90673_0.txt
claimed by southern citizens and newspapers,90673_0.txt
that there is no condoning of,90673_0.txt
"lynch law in the south, and that public",90673_0.txt
opinion deprecates it. The sentiment,90673_0.txt
"of the south, it is asserted, is as much",90673_0.txt
punishment of,90673_0.txt
opposed to summary,90673_0.txt
"crimes, whether committed by one race",90673_0.txt
"or the other, as the sentiment of the",90673_0.txt
north ..,90673_0.txt
Yet here is a typical case of lynch,90673_0.txt
law; no trial allowed the victim; no,90673_0.txt
opportunity to bring evidence to prove,90673_0.txt
"his innocence; he is seized, strung up",90673_0.txt
to the nearest tree and his body riddled,90673_0.txt

to their duty as good citizens,90673_0.txt
"had they done ctherwise.""",90673_0.txt
The only condition under which this,90673_0.txt
verdict is admissible is that lynch law,90673_0.txt
tends to discourage and prevent such,90673_0.txt
"crimes, where the regular and orderly",90673_0.txt
processes of justice under the law do,90673_0.txt
not. But it is admitted that the history,90673_0.txt

conclusion. Where lynchings have been,90673_0.txt

"This is the experience of the world,",90673_0.txt
and nothing has occurred to indicate,90673_0.txt
that it would be otherwise or is otherwise,90673_0.txt
in the south. The coroner's jury,90673_0.txt

less record. The voices of her sons have been heard in,90776_1.txt
the councils of their native state and they have taken prominent,90776_1.txt
part in the enactment of her laws; some of the state,90776_1.txt
were born within her limits and the decisions of her pure,90776_1.txt
and learned judges will ever adorn the court records of South,90776_1.txt
Carolina.,90776_1.txt
"On almost every battlefield of Virginia, and in",90776_1.txt
"other portions of the South, many of her best and bravest",90776_1.txt
men made their country and state ever glorious by their heroic,90776_1.txt
"deaths, a willing sacrifice to a cause they knew to be",90776_1.txt
right. Yet with all these recollections of the past its people,90776_1.txt
stood supinely and allowed this piece of barbarism to occur,90776_1.txt
. It is easy to imagine that were it possible these great,90776_1.txt
men of Abbeville's glorious past would shake off the cerements,90776_1.txt
of the tomb and rise in solemn and indignant protest,90776_1.txt
against the living for permitting such an inexcusable crime,90776_1.txt
"If anything could add to the horror of it, it would be in the",90776_1.txt
fact that the lynching took place in open daylight and that,90776_1.txt
there was not the least attempt on the part of the mob at,90776_1.txt
"concealment. If, when the sheriff first rescued the murdered",90776_1.txt
man from the hands of the mob why did he not summon,90776_1.txt
"a posse and protect the man, as he had sworn to do,",90776_1.txt
from the hands of the mob? Can any sane man be made,90776_1.txt
to believe that the sheriff really tried to protect the prisoner?,90776_1.txt
"Why did he not use his pistol and have shot, as he ought unquestionably",90776_1.txt
to have done down a few members of the mob?,90776_1.txt
"Had he done this, he would in all probability have saved",90776_1.txt
"his county from this burning disgrace, for while a mob may",90776_1.txt
"be composed of individually brave men, as a mob they are",90776_1.txt
"the veriest cowards that can be conceived of and can, as has",90776_1.txt
"been often the case, easily be cowed by one determined man.",90776_1.txt
"To make matters worse still, there is the finding of the coroner's",90776_1.txt
jury that the man came to his death at the hands of,90776_1.txt
"parties unknown. The finding should have been, at the",90776_1.txt
hands of parties whose names the jury did not wish to divulge,90776_1.txt
". If it were not such a serious matter, the taking of",90776_1.txt
"the life of a man against whom there was no indictment, the",90776_1.txt
whole affair would furnish an adequate theme for the basis,90776_1.txt
of a comic opera. Was the sheriff so overcome by fear,90776_1.txt
that he was unable to recognize any of the mob when it,90776_1.txt
came to giving his testimony before the coroner's jury or to,90776_1.txt
remember their names? He should have been put in solitary,90776_1.txt
confinement until he could freshen up his memory a,90776_1.txt
little and give in some of the names of those who composed,90776_1.txt
the mob. But the writer almost forgot to mention the fact,90776_1.txt
that the victim was guilty of the terrible crime of striking,90776_1.txt
one of his assailants with a hammer.,90776_1.txt
If the hammer had,90776_1.txt
been a powerful dynamite bomb he would have been perfectly,90776_1.txt
justified in throwing it in the midst of his assailants,90776_1.txt
when it became evident that they were determined to kill,90776_1.txt
him and take as many of them along with him as possible,90776_1.txt
for they were more deserving of death than their victim.,90776_1.txt
But while all this was going on where was the mayor of the,90776_1.txt

negro,90779_0.txt
"called"" Battleax""",90779_0.txt

it was learned that he could not have,90779_0.txt
been in the,90779_0.txt
case.,90779_0.txt
Late in the afternoon,90779_0.txt
two deputies from the sheriff's,90779_0.txt
office,90779_0.txt
arrested a,90779_0.txt
man found near the,90779_0.txt
railroad,90779_0.txt
tracks at Six Points. This,90779_0.txt
man seemed to be under the effects,90779_0.txt

needle and not from outside causes.,90779_0.txt
Entrance to the Erhardt home was,90779_0.txt
gained through a window on the west,90779_0.txt
side of the kitchen. Holes had been,90779_0.txt
punched through the frame of the,90779_0.txt
"screen, which covered the entire win-",90779_0.txt
"dow, and the hook Then the",90779_0.txt
lifted.,90779_0.txt
whole frame was removed and placed,90779_0.txt
on the ground. The chisel used in,90779_0.txt
gaining entrance was found on the,90779_0.txt
ground beneath the window.,90779_0.txt
Went to Investigate,90779_0.txt
In the kitchen of the Erhardt home,90779_0.txt
was a table which stood by the window,90779_0.txt
. Hanging on the window frame,90779_0.txt
was a collander. It is thought that the,90779_0.txt
first man to enter the window had to,90779_0.txt
Use only half the window because of,90779_0.txt
"the table, and struck the collander with",90779_0.txt
"his shoulder, knocking it to the kitchen",90779_0.txt
"floor. This alarming Mrs. Erhardt, it",90779_0.txt
is believed she arose and entered the,90779_0.txt
"kitchen, leaving her husband asleep.",90779_0.txt
As she passed through the door of the,90779_0.txt
"aitchen, it is believed one of the men",90779_0.txt
"struck her, the blow striking her on",90779_0.txt
the back of her left shoulder and,90779_0.txt
knocking her to the floor.,90779_0.txt
While in that position it is believed,90779_0.txt
the man struck her several times with,90779_0.txt
"the blunt jack, the blows landing on",90779_0.txt
"her head and forehead. Those blows,",90779_0.txt
"it seems, were not enough to make her",90779_0.txt
unconscious and she crawled to the,90779_0.txt
"wall near the door, where marks show",90779_0.txt
that a blow was struck which did not,90779_0.txt
"hit her, but smashed the wall. Pools",90779_0.txt
of blood in the center of the kitchen,90779_0.txt
and near this wall bear out the theory,90779_0.txt
that first blows struck did not render,90779_0.txt
Mrs. the Erhardt unconscious.,90779_0.txt
The attack on Mr. Erhardt is believed,90779_0.txt
to have been made while he was,90779_0.txt
asleep. He did not regain consciousness,90779_0.txt
and died without being able to,90779_0.txt

Until Albert Erhardt arrives it will,90779_0.txt
be impossible to determine the amount,90779_0.txt

anything. It is not thought by George,90779_0.txt
Erhardt that his mother had more than,90779_0.txt
$ 20 in the house at the time.,90779_0.txt
Neighbors living near the Erhardt,90779_0.txt
house stated yesterday morning that,90779_0.txt
they had heard noises early in the,90779_0.txt

sufficiently to crawl from the kitchen,90779_0.txt

The color line is drawn sharply by,90781_0.txt
lynchers in Kentucky Several weeks,90781_0.txt
ago a Frankfort Negro was lynched by,90781_0.txt
a mob for having shot a circus man.,90781_0.txt
In Trigg county a Negro boy charged,90781_0.txt
with attempted assault was lynched.|,90781_0.txt
Between the dates of these two lynchings,90781_0.txt
"Dr. Nuttall, a physician in charge",90781_0.txt
of patients at the Feeble Minded institute,90781_0.txt
"at Frankfort, was charged with",90781_0.txt
having assaulted a woman under his,90781_0.txt
care. He was allowed ample time to,90781_0.txt
"make preparations to avoid arrest, and",90781_0.txt
after a good deal of delay that might,90781_0.txt
easily have been avoided a reward was,90781_0.txt
offered for him. There was no apparent,90781_0.txt
interest upon the part of the authorities,90781_0.txt
in bringing him to trial.,90781_0.txt
The hoodlums at Frankfort and those,90781_0.txt
in Trigg county committed murder,90781_0.txt
merely for the pleasure there was in,90781_0.txt
stringing up a defenseless victim. The,90781_0.txt
three brothers of the girl in Trigg,90781_0.txt
county to whom an improper proposal,90781_0.txt
was made were guarding the Negro on,90781_0.txt
his way to jail when the mob interfered,90781_0.txt
. Their conduct under trying circumstances,90781_0.txt
was creditable. The Negro,90781_0.txt
"would, of course, have been convicted",90781_0.txt
if he had been put in jail and tried. A,90781_0.txt
Negro charged with attempted criminal,90781_0.txt
assault is not dealt tenderly with,90781_0.txt
by a jury of white men.,90781_0.txt
There is but one conclusion to be,90781_0.txt
drawn from the three cases. Attempted,90781_0.txt
criminal assault is punishable by,90781_0.txt
death without trial if the accused is,90781_0.txt
black. Shooting and wounding are punishable,90781_0.txt
by death without trial if the,90781_0.txt
accused is black. Criminal assault is,90781_0.txt
to be winked at if the accused is white,90781_0.txt
and prominent. It is difficult to decide,90781_0.txt

LYNCHING.,90882_1.txt
According to the Chicago Tribune,90882_1.txt
"of Dec. 31st, 127 persons were",90882_1.txt
mobbed and lynched in this country,90882_1.txt
during the year 1898; 122 of,90882_1.txt
these were males and five males.,90882_1.txt
Of these lynchings 118 occurred,90882_1.txt
in the south and 9 in the north;,90882_1.txt
"102 were negroes, 23 whites and",90882_1.txt
2 Indians. The alleged crimes for,90882_1.txt
which the victims were lynched,90882_1.txt
"were as follows: Theft, 6; arson,",90882_1.txt
"2; violation of contract, 1; insults,",90882_1.txt
"2; murder, 61; attempted rape, 7;",90882_1.txt

Glancing over these figures it,90882_1.txt
will be observed that seven negroes,90882_1.txt
were mobbed and lynched for attempting,90882_1.txt
to rape white women and,90882_1.txt
one was similarly dealt with upon,90882_1.txt
the theory that he was aiding his,90882_1.txt
companion to commit such a rash,90882_1.txt
"act. Therefore, out of the 102",90882_1.txt
negroes who were mobbed and,90882_1.txt
"lynched the past year, only 24 were",90882_1.txt
charged with attempting to outrage,90882_1.txt
white women. Yet those who are,90882_1.txt

negroes are lynched for. But these,90882_1.txt

Before Las Animas knew that the,90931_0.txt

been dead more than an hour.,90931_0.txt

anee at the jail and demanded of the,90931_0.txt
"sheriff that the prisoner, Leberg, be",90931_0.txt
turned over to them. The demand met,90931_0.txt
with instand refusal.,90931_0.txt
Without further words the leaders,90931_0.txt
of the mob disarmed and overpowered,90931_0.txt
"Sheriff Brown, Marshal McCune and",90931_0.txt
Undersheriff McAffee.,90931_0.txt
The three men were then gagged,90931_0.txt
"and bound, thrown into a cell and left",90931_0.txt
there while the mob began the effort,90931_0.txt
to get Leberg out of the steel cage in,90931_0.txt
which he was confined.,90931_0.txt
The work of the mob last night had,90931_0.txt
made entrance to the jail comparatively,90931_0.txt
easy. All that was left between,90931_0.txt
the mob and the prisoner was the steel,90931_0.txt
"gage, which the mob last night battered",90931_0.txt
in vain.,90931_0.txt
With the fifty men was one who was,90931_0.txt
evidently well acquainted with the,90931_0.txt
mechanism of the lock on the steel,90931_0.txt
cage. The lock last night resisted all,90931_0.txt
"efforts of the mob, but in a few minutes",90931_0.txt
tonignt the locksmith of the party,90931_0.txt
managed to break it and effect an entrance,90931_0.txt
to the cell of Leberg.,90931_0.txt
When the avengers arrived at the,90931_0.txt
ja Leberg was in bed. When he,90931_0.txt
"heard them he got up and dressed, and",90931_0.txt
when the men broke into the cell he,90931_0.txt
met them calmly and allowed the leaders,90931_0.txt
to put a rope around his neck with,90931_0.txt
out resistance.,90931_0.txt
"In thirty minutes, that is at 9:15,",90931_0.txt
"Leberg was brought out of the cell,",90931_0.txt
and the rope put around his neck. He,90931_0.txt
was then led by the mob to a telegraph,90931_0.txt
pole in the railroad yards about 150,90931_0.txt
yards from the jail.,90931_0.txt
"Without evidence of excitement, and",90931_0.txt
"with absolutely no noise, the rope was",90931_0.txt
hoisted over an arm of the pole and,90931_0.txt
Leberg was jerked twenty feet off the,90931_0.txt
ground by twenty men.,90931_0.txt
"No shots were fired at the body, and",90931_0.txt
there was absolutely no other demonstration,90931_0.txt

"Las Animas, Colo. -Before the",90931_1.txt
lynching of Leberg Thursday night,90931_1.txt
there came stories about Leberg,90931_1.txt
which made feeling more bitter. Leberg,90931_1.txt
had been employed as a grader on the,90931_1.txt
Fort Lyon storage canal and a few,90931_1.txt
days ago attempted to kill another,90931_1.txt
man with a crowbar. So incensed were,90931_1.txt
the men working in the camp at his,90931_1.txt
actions at that time that he was,90931_1.txt
driven out and toiá never to return.,90931_1.txt
Then came the stories from the,90931_1.txt
"ranch of George Purvis, where Leberg",90931_1.txt
ate supper the night of the murder. Le-,90931_1.txt
"berg went into the home of Purvis,",90931_1.txt
where he demanded and was given supper,90931_1.txt
. While at the table he was surly,90931_1.txt
and threatened to make trouble. He demanded,90931_1.txt
"lodging, but Purvis was afraid",90931_1.txt
to have the man in the house.,90931_1.txt
He offered Leberg blankets and a,90931_1.txt
"place to sleep in the barn, but this did",90931_1.txt
"not satisfy him, and he went away",90931_1.txt
muttering. Later he built a camp fire,90931_1.txt
"on the bank of the river, and then he",90931_1.txt
came back and set fire to a haystack,90931_1.txt
"which he thought belonged to Purvis,",90931_1.txt
to get revenge.,90931_1.txt
The haystack that he fired belonged,90931_1.txt
"to Lanvenmeyer, and the arrest of Le-",90931_1.txt

killing of the farmer with the,90931_1.txt
hammer which Leberg secured from,90931_1.txt
the saddle of the victim's horse. Not,90931_1.txt

from the person of the man he had,90931_1.txt
"murdered, and rode away on his victim's",90931_1.txt

When he was captured he expressed,90931_1.txt
no remore for his act and even boasted,90931_1.txt
that he had killed a great land owner,90931_1.txt
who refused to give him a place to,90931_1.txt

added to the horror of the crime and,90931_1.txt

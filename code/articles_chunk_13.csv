he was held to the April term of the,91052_0.txt

There has been some talk of lynching,91052_0.txt

There was some fear that the prisoner,91052_0.txt
might be taken from the train,91052_0.txt

An Explanation Explanation,bp21.txt
THE,bp21.txt
HE DIFFICULTY of understanding the southern lynching spirit soon,bp21.txt
disappears after one has had a better acquaintance with actual racial,bp21.txt
"onditions. For instance, in Florida recently, a moh lynched a white man",bp21.txt
for participating in a shooting feud with another white neighbor. The Negro,bp21.txt
huste suppressed. And the lynching of white business men is undoubtedly,bp21.txt
"intended to impress the colored population with the might of the mob,",bp21.txt
"Without the shadow of a doubt, just as soon as the SUB-NORMAL",bp21.txt
colored law breakers hear of the lynching of this white man they will im-,bp21.txt
mediately become normal and safe units of society. It was to overase the,bp21.txt
Negro that the Atlanta mob lynched a Jew last year. So at least southerners,bp21.txt
"have explained lynchings to us. The Georgia lynchers, we have been informed",bp21.txt
"by the ""yellow journals,"" are respectable citizens, members of the church, some",bp21.txt
"of them, and most of them leaders in business-educated and supposed to be",bp21.txt
enlightened.,bp21.txt
This class of people have been the loudest in their wail against the,bp21.txt
"Mexican bandits, who in the main are reckless dare-devils, ignorant and",bp21.txt
irresponsible. A Mexican mob is made up of nen who have during the past,bp21.txt
"few years lived in lawlessness and revolution, murder was a daily pastime.",bp21.txt
and loot and robbery regarded as the right of the victor. The Americans,bp21.txt
"murdered by these Mexican outlaws in the early stages, were where they",bp21.txt
had been warned not to be; where they had no right to be during times of,bp21.txt
stress and revolution. They had been repeatedly told by American authorities,bp21.txt
to get out of danger and stay out until conditions changed.,bp21.txt
There is quite a little difference between a Georgia mob and a Mexican,bp21.txt
"mob, in Georgia the victims are Negroes mobbed by whites, more often than",bp21.txt
"not, for no particular offense, in Mexico whites were murdered by outlaws.",bp21.txt
"The one is killed while supposedly under the protection of their own flag, in",bp21.txt
"their own country, the other is killed on foreign soil under the flag of the",bp21.txt
highwayman and the professional murderer. There must be some good people,bp21.txt
"in Georgia, but if they lift their voice in condemnation of the men who ruth-",bp21.txt
lessly kill their own fellow citizens and set at defiance the laws not only of,bp21.txt
"their state but of the nation, it is not heard beyond the confines of their own",bp21.txt
little circle.,bp21.txt
"In Mexico, even though the government is not responsible for the depre-",bp21.txt
"dations committed by outlaws, it uses every means in its power to hunt down",bp21.txt
the culprits and as promptly as they are found and caught make their punish-,bp21.txt
"mènt fit their crime. The American government, by its silence, gives encourage-",bp21.txt
ment to this form of lawlessness. Mexican bandits are afraid to come out in,bp21.txt
"the open, American mobs are hailed as ""best citizens."" This explains in a",bp21.txt

"pearance when wanted. A quarrel ensued, pistols",bp28.txt

after a mob lynched one of his relatives. After he,bp28.txt
was indicted he was granted a change of venue. In,bp28.txt
Savannah he was sentenced to be hanged. The higher,bp28.txt
court set aside the verdict and granted a new trial.,bp28.txt
On this occasion he was acquitted.,bp28.txt
"INDICTED again for the murder of Officer Brown,",bp28.txt
he was tried on Nov. 18. 1920. Again he was was,bp28.txt
"arquitted, but so strong was public sentiment against",bp28.txt
him that he was convicted of manslaughter and sen-,bp28.txt
tenced to 15 years in the penitentiary. The court of,bp28.txt

Even if congress should pass an anti-lynch-,bp31.txt

"ENERALLY SPEAKING, thoughtful observers of",bp51.txt
Anyone who has made a serious study of the,bp51.txt
American people knows they are ripe for an upheaval,bp51.txt
There exist among them a number of deep-seated and,bp51.txt
highly inflammable race and religious prejudices. This,bp51.txt
latent group hostility has recently been aggravated by,bp51.txt
incipient class friction caused by the depression. Class.,bp51.txt
unrest and group bostility tend to neutralize each,bp51.txt
"other to an extent, but at the same time they intensify",bp51.txt
"each other, resulting in a complication of smoldering",bp51.txt
discontent. So long as it remains unorganized this,bp51.txt
discontent will vent itself in sporadic and relatively,bp51.txt
"harmless outbursts, overturning a milk truck here.",bp51.txt

hapless fellow over yonder. But these spontaneous,bp51.txt
outbreaks of violence are only dark clouds scudding,bp51.txt
"before the wind, warning us that real hurricane",bp51.txt
weather is on the way.,bp51.txt
It would be a greve error for 2 social analyst to,bp51.txt
mistake last week's disorders for mere outbursts of,bp51.txt
local passion in which only the so-called lawless ele-,bp51.txt
ment participated. The disturbances brought to light,bp51.txt
a social sickness of which careful observers have long,bp51.txt
"been aware; that is, the existence of a latent, country-",bp51.txt
wide mob spirit which threatens to engulf the nation,bp51.txt
in a period of mob rule. We are faced with the dan-,bp51.txt

verdict of the court becoming the mere echo of the,bp51.txt
"clamor of the rabble. Indeed, the law itself may be-",bp51.txt
come simply the codified crotchets of the crowd.,bp51.txt
Certainly that is the lesson the tabloid pictures,bp51.txt
from California and Maryland gave the country. The,bp51.txt
pictures from the coast showed throngs of women and,bp51.txt
children looking on with interest and approval while,bp51.txt
men methodically went about the business of battering,bp51.txt
in the prison doors and dragging out the victims. The,bp51.txt
pictures from the Free State showed the citizenry,bp51.txt
turning out en masse to rescue men whom soldiers had,bp51.txt
arrested for taking part in a lynching. While the men,bp51.txt
who took part in lynchings and riots in defense of,bp51.txt
lynchers were applauded by their fellow citizens on,bp51.txt
the scene condoning editorials and letters of approba-,bp51.txt
tion appeared in newspaers in distant sections of the,bp51.txt
country. The New York Herald Tribune condemned,bp51.txt

"Sull more significant, perhaps, is the attitude of",bp51.txt
public officials towards mobs. Politicians are usually,bp51.txt

lynching law. I am in full sympathy with the more-,bp51.txt
"ment, but doubt that there is much hope of getting",bp51.txt
such a law enacted. Mass disorder is no longer sec-,bp51.txt

that prevents sheriffs and militiamen from effectively,bp51.txt
resisting lynchers is likely to prevent congressmen,bp51.txt
from making it a Federal crime.,bp51.txt
6,bp51.txt
If an anti-lynching law is passed by Congress the,bp51.txt

The citation of the existence of,bp53.txt
the Educational Equality League,bp53.txt
and its lack of racial support is,bp53.txt
made only to ask one question:,bp53.txt
Why have many of us failed to sup-,bp53.txt
port this and similar organizations,bp53.txt
that are fighting for our legal,bp53.txt
"rights, and against illegal discrim",bp53.txt
ination against and segregation of,bp53.txt
us? It certainly is not because the,bp53.txt
majority of us believe in segrega-,bp53.txt
"tion, but simply because we reason",bp53.txt
that inasmuch as the institution of,bp53.txt
segregation has become so firmly,bp53.txt
intrenched among us that it is vain,bp53.txt
"and impossible for us to abolish it,",bp53.txt
"in spite of laws to the contrary,",bp53.txt
and still others who are opposed to,bp53.txt
"the institution, do not exert them-",bp53.txt
selves in opposition thereto for the,bp53.txt
reason that they fear that it will,bp53.txt
endanger their already insecure,bp53.txt
economic security or jobs to be,bp53.txt
more explicit. But both these rea-,bp53.txt
"sons are unsound, for in the first",bp53.txt
instance,bp53.txt
any rublio institution,bp53.txt
'which is contrary to established,bp53.txt
law is illegal and therefore subject,bp53.txt
to and possible of abolition; and in,bp53.txt
the second instance very few Ne-,bp53.txt
groes have lost their jobs for con-,bp53.txt
tending for their civil and public,bp53.txt
"rights, which were bestowed on",bp53.txt
them by none other than the so-,bp53.txt
called dominant group.,bp53.txt
In deciding,bp53.txt
the,bp53.txt
question of,bp53.txt
whether Negroes should accept or,bp53.txt
"reject segregation, the arguments",bp53.txt
advanced should be based upon,bp53.txt
state law and on the merits or de-,bp53.txt
"merits of the case. For instance,",bp53.txt
in Pennsylvania the legislative act,bp53.txt
establishing a public school sys-,bp53.txt
tem did not establish a separate,bp53.txt
system for the Negro and white,bp53.txt
races. And it specifically prohibits,bp53.txt
in section 1405 of the School Code,bp53.txt
any distinction on account of race,bp53.txt
"or color. Therefore, in Pennsylva-",bp53.txt
nia there is but one way of decid-,bp53.txt
ing the school segregation issue and,bp53.txt
that is on the basis of existing,bp53.txt
laws. All other grounds for décid-,bp53.txt
ing the issue in this state must be,bp53.txt
"relegated to the future, until, at",bp53.txt
such time the Negroes decide to,bp53.txt
agitate for the repeal of present,bp53.txt
equal educational laws. So the,bp53.txt
question of segregated schools in,bp53.txt
Pennsylvania is already decided,bp53.txt
by law.,bp53.txt
Now it is well to examine at least,bp53.txt
some of the supposed merits of,bp53.txt
segregation in our schools. Pro-,bp53.txt
segregationists argue that the col-,bp53.txt
ored children fare better under Ne,bp53.txt
gro teachers. That this is true by,bp53.txt
reason of the fact that the raco,bp53.txt
teachers better understand the Ne-,bp53.txt
gro child and his needs. Although,bp53.txt
the first argument that the Negro,bp53.txt
children fare better under their,bp53.txt
own teachers is true to a certain,bp53.txt
"extent, it is also true that the Ne-",bp53.txt
gro school by virtue of its inade-,bp53.txt
quate provision and consequent in-,bp53.txt
"equality, especially as they exist in",bp53.txt
the South and must inevitably ex-,bp53.txt
ist everywhere else where the sy9-,bp53.txt
"tem of segregation is complete,",bp53.txt
cannot do otherwise than turn out,bp53.txt
an Inferiorly educated child. A,bp53.txt
very concrete example of this was,bp53.txt
a Negro child of my acquaintance,bp53.txt
who graduated from a so-called ac-,bp53.txt
credited southern high school. He,bp53.txt
applied for admission to Temple,bp53.txt
"University, but was rejected on the",bp53.txt
ground that Temple could only,bp53.txt
recognize two years of his four,bp53.txt
years high school course. The con-,bp53.txt
sequence was that he had to go,bp53.txt
back to high school for two more,bp53.txt
years! Imagine six years of high,bp53.txt
"school, which was all the result of",bp53.txt
"a segregated system of education,",bp53.txt
with in many respects under-,bp53.txt
trained and underpaid teachers.,bp53.txt
Again it sometimes happens in,bp53.txt
the segregated school that the sys-,bp53.txt
tem of school supervision is not ac-,bp53.txt
cording to the rules as rigidly en-,bp53.txt
forced as it is in the white school.,bp53.txt
There is resultantly much class,bp53.txt
"room laxity, such as passing a",bp53.txt
"child from one grade to another,",bp53.txt
"regardless of merit; and also, in",bp53.txt
many instances favoritism has too,bp53.txt
often found its way into the class,bp53.txt
"rooms of the separate school, re-",bp53.txt
sulting in the unmerited advance-,bp53.txt
ment of many of the children of,bp53.txt
the favored few. So it is clear,bp53.txt
that regardless of this better un-,bp53.txt
derstanding on the part of the Ne-,bp53.txt
gro teacher of the Negro child and,bp53.txt
"his needs, that such does not and",bp53.txt
cannot in many cases result in a,bp53.txt
race child faring better. Perhaps,bp53.txt
such would be the case if the Ne-,bp53.txt
gro teacher taught in the same,bp53.txt
school with his white associate.,bp53.txt
Then he would undoubtedly be able,bp53.txt
to communicate some of his un,bp53.txt
derstanding of the Negro child to,bp53.txt
his colleagues of the opposite,bp53.txt
group.,bp53.txt
admission,bp53.txt
evidently.,bp53.txt
schools.,bp53.txt
Another convincing example of.,bp53.txt
the handicap of the segregated,bp53.txt
school to the Negro student which,bp53.txt
comes from the birthplace of seg-,bp53.txt
"regation, the south, is one of a Ne-",bp53.txt
gro girl who graduated from a,bp53.txt
"group 1, class A, state of North",bp53.txt
"Carolina, approved high school.",bp53.txt
She graduated in the upper three-,bp53.txt
"quarters of her class, which would",bp53.txt
have entitled ber to admission,bp53.txt
without an entrance examination,bp53.txt
as was the policy in the,bp53.txt
of white students from,bp53.txt
the same standing of high,bp53.txt
At least this is what Dr. J. Henry,bp53.txt
Highsmith of the department of,bp53.txt
public instruction of the state of,bp53.txt
"North Carolina wrote to me. Hence,",bp53.txt
"segregated schools, even those that",bp53.txt
have a competent faculty of teach-,bp53.txt
"ers, but who are more or less re-",bp53.txt
"stricted, cannot be anything else in",bp53.txt
the end but a handicap to the Ne,bp53.txt
gro students.,bp53.txt
With respect to the economic ar,bp53.txt
gument for segregated schools that,bp53.txt
it affords employment to a number,bp53.txt
"of Negro teachers, this too must",bp53.txt
be conceded.,bp53.txt
But on,bp53.txt
"hand, especially in states like Penn-",bp53.txt
sylvania with equal educational,bp53.txt
"laws, the Negro teacher has the",bp53.txt
legal opportunity of teaching in,bp53.txt
"any school. However, they are not",bp53.txt

of this one opportunity of teaching,bp53.txt
"in any school. However, they are",bp53.txt

tage of this one opportunity of,bp53.txt

they are not to be blamed for tak-,bp53.txt
ing advantage of this one oppor,bp53.txt
tunity of practicing their profes-,bp53.txt
"sion even in a segregated school,",bp53.txt
when the Negro masses are doing,bp53.txt
nothing to bring about enforce-,bp53.txt
ment of the law which gives them,bp53.txt
equal teaching privileges and the,bp53.txt
opportunity to teach in any school.,bp53.txt
the other,bp53.txt
I do not,bp53.txt
In making this statement,bp53.txt
mean that Negro teachers and prin-,bp53.txt
cipals are justified in upholding the,bp53.txt
system of school segregation and,bp53.txt
justifying ita existence by baseless,bp53.txt
reasons. They should quietly and,bp53.txt
efficiently pursue their teaching,bp53.txt
without at any time attempting to,bp53.txt
hinder any fight that the com-,bp53.txt
munity may make in behalf of,bp53.txt
equal teaching opportunities for,bp53.txt
them. In the state where segrega-,bp53.txt
tion has been established by state,bp53.txt
"law, as for instance in the south,",bp53.txt
if the Negrocs in those states de-,bp53.txt
"sire mixed schools, then it should",bp53.txt
be by means of agitation for repeal,bp53.txt
of the state law which has estab-,bp53.txt
lished the segregated institution.,bp53.txt
come,bp53.txt
Still another reason of the advo-,bp53.txt
cates of separate schools is that,bp53.txt
while teachers are naturally preju,bp53.txt
diced against Negroes and that,bp53.txt
they naturally as a result must be,bp53.txt
blased and unfair in their judgment,bp53.txt
of the scholastic ratings of the Ne-,bp53.txt
"gro child. However, this may ""d",bp53.txt
"true, there is ample proof in th",bp53.txt
numerous graduations of our gir s,bp53.txt
and boys from mixed schools th .t,bp53.txt
such is not generally the case. And,bp53.txt
if competent and efficient colored,bp53.txt
teachers were teaching in the me,bp53.txt
actools such a policy would,bp53.txt
even more neglible than it is today.,bp53.txt
It is manifest that any institu-,bp53.txt
tion which has so evidently im-,bp53.txt
proved the relations between the,bp53.txt
white ard Negro races as the,bp53.txt
"mixed school system, should be re-",bp53.txt

its resultant betterment of inter-,bp53.txt
racial understanding ought to out-,bp53.txt
weigh all other considerations,bp53.txt
"whose effect is merely racial, espe-",bp53.txt
cially in a country where it is im-,bp53.txt

"peopie. And even then, if he could",bp53.txt
"so isol: te himself, he would soon",bp53.txt

races of mankind are so depend-,bp53.txt

ing stage of the world such might,bp53.txt
"have been possible, but not in this",bp53.txt

Certainly it seems to me that the,bp53.txt

Lollis and Dendy got to discussing,bp57.txt

In the midst of the construction,bp57.txt
r. Dendy received a warning. It,bp57.txt
was an anonymous letter decorated,bp57.txt
with skull and bones. It read:,bp57.txt
"You look good to us, if you build",bp57.txt

Somehow Young Dendy didn't seem!,bp57.txt

Reports of the slaying reached Val-,bp62.txt
dosta early the next morning. The,bp62.txt
first reports stated that Mrs. Smith,bp62.txt
had been raped-a charge which was,bp62.txt
never substantiated. Within a few,bp62.txt
hours a mob descended on the Old,bp62.txt

reported that the victims met their,bp62.txt

money for his subsequent work. Then,bp62.txt
one day Johnson didn't show up in,bp62.txt

he was just young and foolish. But,bp62.txt
it is possible that his youth gave him,bp62.txt
a courage which had been beaten,bp62.txt

Anyway. Sidney Johnson laid on his,bp62.txt

ords. A Negro lawyer recently went to one of Mr. Hull's county seats,bp78.txt
"to file a divorce petition. The white neighbors of Mr. Hull, incensed",bp78.txt
"over the audacity of a Negro lawyer attempting to do such a thing,",bp78.txt
ran the lawyer out of town. A white lawyer had to be hired to handle,bp78.txt

"During all of these outrages, Secretary Hull was ominous silent.",bp78.txt
Civilization was not endangered as he saw it. When a Georgia mob,bp78.txt
lynched a pregnant Negro mother and while she dangled from the end,bp78.txt
"of a rope, her unborn child was ripped from her belly by one of the",bp78.txt
lynchers and the faint cries of the child were stilled when the lynch-,bp78.txt

hear were their voices raised against Sie Dyer anti-lynching bill and,bp78.txt
all the other anti-lynching bills that followed.,bp78.txt
It is surprising how loud these southerners can boller when the,bp78.txt
shoe is pinching their foot. I deplore inhuman treatment of any per-,bp78.txt
son or race of people. It is indeed unfortunate that America has stood,bp78.txt
"for so much savagery within its own borders that, now when it cries",bp78.txt

enemies can so conveniently point to its own sins.,bp78.txt

committed any crime to justify their treatment. Neither did the thous-,bp78.txt
ands of Negroes who have been outraged both in the North and South,bp78.txt
commit any crimes to justify their lynching and burning at the stake.,bp78.txt
No doubt the Germans and Japs learned much of their horrible tech-,bp78.txt

"I hope America learns from this war that, decent treatment of",bp78.txt

stream culture that they no,bp100.txt

black readers and whether,bp100.txt
they have reacted to this,bp100.txt
coverage or lack of it by,bp100.txt

It is quite clear that its,bp100.txt
survival is in the hands of,bp100.txt
black people. They can,bp100.txt
decide whether to support,bp100.txt
black publications or,bp100.txt

that mob execution was really about social control,bp106.txt

and had little to do with crime control.,bp106.txt
Ida B. Wells (1862-1931) could easily be called,bp106.txt

"too ""uppity,"" a large white mob took the three",bp109.txt

Wells decided to launch her anti-lynching move-,bp109.txt

less than one-fifth of the victims of lynch mobs were,bp109.txt
even accused of rape by their killers. She said that,bp109.txt
"racist southern white mobs ""cry rape"" to brand their",bp109.txt
"victims as ""moral monsters"" and to place them ""be-",bp109.txt
"yond the pale of human sympathy.""",bp109.txt
She wrote that while Southern white men raped,bp109.txt
"black women and children with impunity, they con-",bp109.txt
sidered any liaison between a black man and a white,bp109.txt
woman as involuntary by definition. She pointed out,bp109.txt
that children produced by white-black relationships,bp109.txt
"were called ""mulatto” from the Spanish word for",bp109.txt
mule because racist whites believed that mixed-race,bp109.txt

The racial bias within the,bp113.txt
statistics on capital punishment,bp113.txt
speaks for itself. Although Blacks,bp113.txt
comprised about nine percent of the,bp113.txt
"U.S. population in the 1930s, almost",bp113.txt
50 percent of all prisoners who were,bp113.txt

Afro-Americans. 97.1 percent of all,bp113.txt
whites executed had been convicted,bp113.txt
for murder. Only 10 white men were,bp113.txt
executed for rape during the entire,bp113.txt
ten year period. 115 Black men were,bp113.txt
"sentenced to die for rape in the 1930s,",bp113.txt

Advocates of capital punishment,bp113.txt
found themselves on the defensive in,bp113.txt
the 1960s. Research revealed that,bp113.txt
"between 1928 and 1949, the average",bp113.txt
homicide rates in states that allowed,bp113.txt

Neither Hoover nor any social scien-,bp113.txt

tionship between capital punishment,bp113.txt
and crime deterrence. The public,bp113.txt
was told repepeatedly that capital,bp113.txt

there was a sharp division be-,bp129.txt

He visited England in 1912,bp129.txt

was that DuBois did not want,bp129.txt

-By COUNCILMAN EARL BROWN BROWN EARL COUNCILMAN,bp150.txt
1,bp150.txt
After a painstaking investigation the FSI,bp150.txt
presented Gov. J. P. Coleman of Mississippi with,bp150.txt
the list of names of the mob members who,bp150.txt
lynched Mack Parker in Poplarville a few weeks,bp150.txt
ago. The Chief Executive of the Sovereign State,bp150.txt
of Ignorance and Bigotry stuck the list in his,bp150.txt
"pocket, announced that he would give it to the",bp150.txt
grand jury when it convenes next November and,bp150.txt
then caught a plane for Washington to testify,bp150.txt
against civil rights legislation now pending in,bp150.txt
"Congress,",bp150.txt
Although Gov. Coleman had bleated boister-,bp150.txt
ously against lynching when Parker was spirited,bp150.txt
away from his jail cell by the mob and beaten,bp150.txt
and shot until he was dead. everyone knew that,bp150.txt
he was talking through his wool hat and that,bp150.txt
he really was on the side of,bp150.txt
the lynchers. If he hadn't,bp150.txt
"been, he would have ordered",bp150.txt
a grand jury convened the,bp150.txt
"second the FBI gave him, the",bp150.txt
"list of names of the lynchers,",bp150.txt
presented it to them and de-,bp150.txt
manded immediate action.,bp150.txt
He would not have ducked,bp150.txt
out to Washington to defend,bp150.txt
lynching and denounce civil,bp150.txt
rights legislation.,bp150.txt
"Parker is gone, his body is",bp150.txt
"cold and rotting, in the Mississippi earth. but",bp150.txt
Coleman is still around making it safe for fu-,bp150.txt
ture lynchers to do their dastardly deeds. Not,bp150.txt
only is Parker gone but he is almost forgotten.,bp150.txt
But as I have said before it wasn't only Parker,bp150.txt
but the entire Negro race in the U. S. was,bp150.txt
lynched when the mob struck. This is how Cole-,bp150.txt
man and his mobsters wanted it and this is how,bp150.txt
they have it. Nobody is stopping them.,bp150.txt
Killed Section 3,bp150.txt
There would be a good chance of stopping,bp150.txt
them if there were a federal law that would,bp150.txt
guarantee the security of a person from lynch-,bp150.txt
ers. Back in 1957 when a civil rights bill was in-,bp150.txt
"troduced in Congress, it included a section (num-",bp150.txt
ber 3 which empowered the federal government,bp150.txt
"to step in, investigate, take over and prosecute",bp150.txt
mobsters charged with violating the personal,bp150.txt
security of any citizen. It was aimed directly,bp150.txt
at protecting the rights of Negroes in the South.,bp150.txt
Because the Southern senators threatened to,bp150.txt
"filibuster the bill to death, the Republican and",bp150.txt
the Northern Democratic senators killed section,bp150.txt
3 and passed a weak-tea-with-milk bill which,bp150.txt
was intended to get the politicians off the hook,bp150.txt
with the Negro voters. The bill isn't worth a,bp150.txt
hill of Mississippi mud.,bp150.txt
What has made the post-mortem actions in,bp150.txt
the Mack Parker case so cynical and hypocritical,bp150.txt
is that the FBI quickly moved in when he was,bp150.txt
"lynched, thoroughly investigated the crime and",bp150.txt
"came up with the names of the killers. Yet, all",bp150.txt
"they could do, according to the Department of",bp150.txt
"Justice, was to turn over the names to the Gov.",bp150.txt
"of Mississippi, who has been one of the chief",bp150.txt
fomenters of lynching and mob violence ever,bp150.txt
since he was sworn in. He has inveighed against,bp150.txt
"school integration and for white supremacy, thus",bp150.txt
encouraging the lynchers to do their damndest.,bp150.txt
Which they have done.,bp150.txt
Civil Rights Bila,bp150.txt
Congress now has a number of civil rights,bp150.txt
bills in its hopper. The one supported by Presi-,bp150.txt
dent Eisenhower has carefully omitted a guaran-,bp150.txt
tee of personal security of the individual. So has,bp150.txt
the one slipped in by Senate Majority Leader,bp150.txt
"Lyndon Johnson. On the other hand, the Douglas-",bp150.txt
Javits-Celler bill definitely has a section about,bp150.txt
personal security of the individual citizen.,bp150.txt
In view of the Parker lynching and continu-,bp150.txt
"ous racial unrest in the South, it is mandatory",bp150.txt
that Congress pass the Douglas-Javits-Celler,bp150.txt
civil right bill.,bp150.txt
Anything less would be nothing at all. If sec-,bp150.txt
"tion three, the personal security section. had not",bp150.txt
"been deleted from the civil rights bill of '57, the",bp150.txt
U. S. Government would have been able to act,bp150.txt
in the Mack Parker case. The persons named by,bp150.txt
the FBI would have been arrested and charged,bp150.txt
with the crime of lynching. At least justice would,bp150.txt
have gotten started. This is more than what,bp150.txt
happens in similar cases.,bp150.txt
The chances of Congress passing a civil rights,bp150.txt
"bill with teeth are slim, however. The President.",bp150.txt
who has kept tongue in check during the Mack,bp150.txt
"Parker tragedy, has already declared that he is",bp150.txt

"civil rights bills, and most of the Northern Demo-",bp150.txt
crats exclaim it's a shame when a Negro is done,bp150.txt
in and let it go at that.,bp150.txt
Under the circumstances it would seem that,bp150.txt
the only way for a Negro down South to stay,bp150.txt
alive is to go into action against his tormentors,bp150.txt
himself.,bp150.txt

Needed A Federal Anti-Lynch Law A Federal Anti- Lynch Law,bp151.txt
The withdrawal of the Federal Bureau of Investigation from,bp151.txt
"the Poplarville, Miss. mob-lynch case clearly demonstrates the",bp151.txt
need for anti-lynching legislation. It is recognized that the,bp151.txt
agency did an exhaustive investigation into the death of Mack,bp151.txt
"Charles Parker, but found no evidence that federal law was",bp151.txt
violated. Undoubtedly the FBI was working in a limited area of,bp151.txt
authority. It is commendable that its findings have been made,bp151.txt
available to Gov. James H. Coleman.,bp151.txt
It is unmistakeably clear that the power of the FBI must,bp151.txt
be broadened to deal with mob violence. Congress must act,bp151.txt
speedily to give the Department of Justice the right to seek,bp151.txt
federal. indictments of those who would take the law in their,bp151.txt
own hands.,bp151.txt
It is recognized that already the FBI has moved far be.,bp151.txt
"yond the 1946 Monroc, Ga., lynching in its investigative me-",bp151.txt
thods. It has turned over the names of suspects implicated in,bp151.txt
the lynching to the governor. Mississippi could serve the cause,bp151.txt
of justice and decency by summoning a special grand jury to,bp151.txt
study the FBI's findings. It would bolster the state's sagging,bp151.txt
prestige in the United States as well as throughout the civilized,bp151.txt
world.,bp151.txt
"When four persons were lynched in Monroe, no namics",bp151.txt
were ever brought to light in the case. In this latter case iden-,bp151.txt
tity of the alleged mob leaders is known. Forthright action,bp151.txt
should be taken to bring the persons named before a grand,bp151.txt
jury and then to trial if the evidence warrants it.,bp151.txt
President Eisenhower has held a firm hand over the Poplar.,bp151.txt
"ville atrocity. He, from the outset, demanded swift actions in",bp151.txt
ferretting out the evidence and naming the guilty parties. Now,bp151.txt
"that his design has materialized, it is purely up to the state of",bp151.txt
Mississippi to take the ball to its proper goal.,bp151.txt
"Sen. Lyndon Johnson, House Speaker Sam Rayburn, GOP",bp151.txt
"leaders Charles A. Halleck and Everett M. Dirksen, we hope, will",bp151.txt
take the lead in enacting civil rights legislation to wipe out tho,bp151.txt
disgrace of Poplarville.,bp151.txt
President Eisenhower and Atty. Gen. William P. Rogers,bp151.txt
acted wisely in putting the investigative arm of the government,bp151.txt
into action to ferret out the lynch-mob. What is needed now,bp151.txt
is wider jurisdiction to handle such crimes. This can be obtained,bp151.txt
through an anti-lynch law with teeth. Lynching ought to be a,bp151.txt

Which is right? The answer lies in how,bp175.txt
but the definitions ·,bp175.txt
lynching is defined,bp175.txt
"are not, admittedly, very precise.",bp175.txt
"It does seem clear that the boy was, at",bp175.txt
"least, killed in the lynch 'spirit. He was",bp175.txt
slain because he had committed an act of,bp175.txt

or at least he most certainly would not,bp175.txt

One characteristic of lynching is that,bp175.txt
it is punishment outside established chan-,bp175.txt

Some authoritative sources,bp175.txt
say that,bp175.txt
lynching in its modern form need not be,bp175.txt
perpetrated by a mob. The Encyclopedia,bp175.txt

tralegal action for inflicting corporal,bp175.txt

A well-known sociology text (Race Re-,bp175.txt
lations by Dr. Brewton Berry) first defines,bp175.txt
lynching as 'execution by a mob without,bp175.txt
"trial . . . of an individual who is suspected,",bp175.txt
convicted or accused of a violation of laws,bp175.txt
"or mores."" But Berry goes on to say that",bp175.txt
"there are those who feel that ""lynching.",bp175.txt
has been driven underground and that,bp175.txt
certain substitutes have arisen to take its,bp175.txt
"place."" Among these, he lists ""murder by",bp175.txt

were the important people in the,bp232.txt
"courtroom, for it is they and all",bp232.txt
other Negro citizens who are often,bp232.txt

all the more because of the impeccable man,bp232.txt
and told him that he was ashamed to be a member,bp232.txt
of the same profession as the defense attorney who,bp232.txt

trial. A white man testified for the state against,bp232.txt

the things may be taken as progressive signs of the,bp232.txt
time.,bp232.txt
Another interesting point that was brought out,bp232.txt
in the trial was the amount of schooling some of,bp232.txt
the defendants had acquired. One of them could,bp232.txt
neither read nor write and two of them had been,bp232.txt
only to the second grade. It seems to be obvious,bp232.txt
that all of the defendants were not only bigoted but,bp232.txt
also utterly without education. This is significant,bp232.txt
because although the lack of education of thern,bp232.txt
Negroes is always emphasized as a reason for their,bp232.txt
"alleged wrong-doing, it is never brought out as a",bp232.txt
reason why southern whites act like beasts.,bp232.txt
"It should not be assumed, however, that educated",bp232.txt

posse of white farmers here,bp330.txt
Sunday night around midnight.,bp330.txt
Military authorities carly in the,bp330.txt
week refused to give the name of,bp330.txt
the soldier who was shot and killed,bp330.txt
by the mob of farmers but cleared,bp330.txt
the victim of a rape accusation by,bp330.txt

that he had the names of at least,bp330.txt
four farmers in the posse but on,bp330.txt
Tuesday still refused to make any,bp330.txt

Background of the lynching was,bp330.txt
a strange tale of alleged rape and,bp330.txt

to women in farm homes near the,bp330.txt
military reservation which has,bp330.txt
"about 40,000 soldiers.",bp330.txt
Killed With Shotgun,bp330.txt
The unnamed soldier victim of,bp330.txt
the mob was allegedly caught by,bp330.txt
the group making telephone calls,bp330.txt
from a white farmer's home during,bp330.txt
the owner's absence. Members of,bp330.txt
the posse claimed they called to,bp330.txt
him to come out but instead he,bp330.txt
blew out the lamp and stepped onto,bp330.txt
the porch with a club which he,bp330.txt
threw at the group.,bp330.txt
One of the mob then fired a shot-,bp330.txt
"gun, according to a member of",bp330.txt
the posse. The Negro soldier died,bp330.txt
about 15 minutes later.,bp330.txt

Etar-Times presents such a pointed observation that entirely agress,bp333.txt

defendants accused of complicity in the lynching of How-,bp333.txt

and the State of Mississippi which is not wiped out by,bp333.txt

Does anyone doubt that this Negro's rights as a,bp333.txt

for the defense waved the bloody shirt of Civil War,bp333.txt
"memories, cried out about States' rights, and a local",bp333.txt
jury acquitted the local defendants.,bp333.txt
The jury acquitted one of the accused although his,bp333.txt
"signed confession, admitting to the FBI that he had",bp333.txt
"been a member of the mob, was introduced in evidence,",bp333.txt
"and despite his failure to take the stand, in the presence",bp333.txt
"of the jury, to repudiate the confession or submit to",bp333.txt
government cross-examination.,bp333.txt
"Not Mississippi alone, but the whole United States,",bp333.txt

It is hard to believe that the marshal was greatly surprised by,bp346.txt

The whole affair is a stench to the nostrils of every law-abid-,bp346.txt

Lynch-rule can't be localized. A civilized nation can't tolerate it,bp346.txt

We may be sure that the Gobbels propaganda mill is already broad-,bp346.txt

TEXARKANA,bp350.txt
Dear Editor: I am a soldier in,bp350.txt
the United States Army. In my,bp350.txt
traveling it was necessary to get,bp350.txt
"of the troop train in Texarkana,",bp350.txt
Texas. Before leaving the train,bp350.txt
many of us Negro soldiers reviewed,bp350.txt
"the case of Willie Vinson, a Negro",bp350.txt
who was lynched by a mob of,bp350.txt
"hoodlums"" in this city last month.",bp350.txt
"Vinson, as the story goes, was ac-",bp350.txt
cused of attacking a white woman.,bp350.txt
and while awaiting trial Vinson,bp350.txt
was lynched by men who are free,bp350.txt
in Texarkana today.,bp350.txt
While at our home camp many,bp350.txt
of us soldiers had been furious to,bp350.txt
read the accounts of this crime in,bp350.txt
Texarkana. We wondered why the,bp350.txt
laws of America were not upheld,bp350.txt
in punishing these brutal killers in,bp350.txt
Texarkana.,bp350.txt
One of my fellow soldiers wrote,bp350.txt
a personal letter to the mayor of,bp350.txt
Texarkana and asked why the city,bp350.txt
officials were not doing their all for,bp350.txt
the sake of. justice. The writer,bp350.txt
pointed out that in these troubled,bp350.txt
days the life of every man-white,bp350.txt
or black-should be preserved for,bp350.txt
"the defense of America. But no,",bp350.txt
Texarkansans would rather kill,bp350.txt
than preserve.,bp350.txt
In answer to my friend's request,bp350.txt
the honorable mayor of Texarkana,bp350.txt
stated that the good citizens of his,bp350.txt
city must be protected. He made it,bp350.txt
known that there are two sets of,bp350.txt

"law of the state, which protects its",bp350.txt
"citizens; second, the law of the mob.",bp350.txt
which sees that men are punished.,bp350.txt
I wondered as my train stopped,bp350.txt

law of the state welcome us? Would,bp350.txt
the rule of the mob hang us?,bp350.txt
"Thus, as my feet touched the soll",bp350.txt

The lynching of a Negro at Quincy.,bp369.txt
"Fla, on Tuesday, occurred under cir-",bp369.txt
cumstances of more flagrant neglect by,bp369.txt
the sheriff than many similar cases of,bp369.txt
mob violence in some of the darkest,bp369.txt
years of the history of this peculiarly,bp369.txt
American crime. In most cases of,bp369.txt
"lynching, the sheriff has made much",bp369.txt
more pretense of giving his prisoner,bp369.txt
"protection, than in this instance. There",bp369.txt
were other unusual aspects of this case.,bp369.txt
While the accused man was suspected,bp369.txt
of attempted assault upon a 12-year-,bp369.txt
"old white girl, no formal charge had",bp369.txt
been placed against him. The most,bp369.txt
"extraordinary feature of the case, is",bp369.txt
that the victim was twice taken from,bp369.txt
his legal protectors.,bp369.txt
Only four masked men wrested him,bp369.txt
from the sheriff the first time. He was,bp369.txt
"taken from the jail, beaten and shot,",bp369.txt
and left for dead. The men had not,bp369.txt
done their work well. Their victim,bp369.txt
dragged himself to the home of an-,bp369.txt
other Negro near. Quincy. There he was,bp369.txt
"again picked up by the sheriff, to be",bp369.txt
taken in an unguarded ambulance to,bp369.txt
Tallahassee. News of this fact leaked,bp369.txt
"out in some mysterious way, and this",bp369.txt
time a band of masked men did their,bp369.txt
work well. The man they had con-,bp369.txt
"demned to death without trial, was",bp369.txt
killed.,bp369.txt
The people who administered this,bp369.txt
"summary execution, with horrible bru-",bp369.txt
"tality, may have been among their vic-",bp369.txt
"tim's accusers, but since no formal",bp369.txt
"charge was made, how do we know that",bp369.txt
it had any basis whatever? There is,bp369.txt
no doubt that many innocent men have,bp369.txt
been lynched.,bp369.txt
There is really little chance that we,bp369.txt
shall ever finally banish the crime of,bp369.txt
"lynching in the South, until we have",bp369.txt
done much more about the background,bp369.txt
which supplies such a favorable setting,bp369.txt
for the crime. When there is a wider,bp369.txt
realization that the Negro should have,bp369.txt
"greater opportunity to live and to work,",bp369.txt
there will be a relaxation of the pres-,bp369.txt
sure designed to hold him down. The,bp369.txt
"year 1919, when thousands of white",bp369.txt
men who had been in the military and,bp369.txt
naval services returned to seek their,bp369.txt
"jobs in the South, was the worst year",bp369.txt
in the modern history of lynching.,bp369.txt
There were 83 lynchings in the United,bp369.txt
"States that year, and 76 of the vicctims",bp369.txt
were Negroes.,bp369.txt
"Lynchings have declined, and Ne-",bp369.txt
groes have gained more political rights,bp369.txt
"than enjoyed in 1919, but we doubt",bp369.txt
"nevertheless, whether their economic",bp369.txt
condition in the South has improved.,bp369.txt
It may even be worse than it was 20 or,bp369.txt
30 years ago. The Negro has been,bp369.txt
"shoved out of the skilled trades, and",bp369.txt
pushed off the best agricultural land.,bp369.txt
Although the thought is one we should,bp369.txt

The question here has to do with,bp376.txt
the size and nature of mobs and the,bp376.txt
technique they employ in disposing,bp376.txt
of their victims. The Georgia flog-,bp376.txt
"gings were identified, we believe.",bp376.txt
"with the Ku Klux Klan, and there",bp376.txt
were some prosecutions. It was,bp376.txt
pretty well established that the flog-,bp376.txt
gings were committed by groups of,bp376.txt
people. The question is: did these,bp376.txt
groups constitute mobs? The,bp376.txt
NAACP thinks they did.,bp376.txt
1,bp376.txt
The Tennessee case was quite,bp376.txt
different in nearly all its aspects,bp376.txt
from the Georgia case. Here was,bp376.txt
a situation in which a question of,bp376.txt
civil rights was involved and there,bp376.txt
was general knowledge on the part,bp376.txt
of the mayor of Brownsville and,bp376.txt
other responsible white people in the,bp376.txt
community that certain colored men,bp376.txt
had been threatened with harm if,bp376.txt
they insisted upon the exercise of,bp376.txt
certain civil rights. The mayor had,bp376.txt
"been appealed to, according to re-",bp376.txt
"ports, and had told colored citizens",bp376.txt
that the situation was beyond his,bp376.txt
control. Groups of whites had in-,bp376.txt
timidated colored individuals. and,bp376.txt
"groups. In the end, one colored man",bp376.txt
was the victim of a gang murder.,bp376.txt
according to the evidence. Was this,bp376.txt
gang murder a lynching? When all,bp376.txt
the circumstances,bp376.txt
considered,bp376.txt

the difference is only one of tech-,bp376.txt

"So, we hold that Tuskegee is",bp376.txt
wrong on the Brownsville case and,bp376.txt

America's Fifth Lynching Fifth Lynching,bp383.txt
America's fifth lynching for 1939 has just come to light,bp383.txt
with the revelation that a Mississippt Negro was tortured to,bp383.txt
death with hot irons for the crimes of refusing to pay for a,bp383.txt
company owned shack which he did not occupy.,bp383.txt
The remarkable thing about this lynching is that it was,bp383.txt
(how reported by any of the large press associations which,bp383.txt
pride themselves on garnering all of the news.,bp383.txt
Had they done so there is no doubt that the innocent,bp383.txt
worker's attempt to stand up for his rights would have been,bp383.txt
garbled and he would have been reported as having insulted,bp383.txt
"a white woman, that despite the fact that he was a deacon",bp383.txt
in his church and obviously a law abiding citizen.,bp383.txt
Hard on the heels of this lynching comes news that the,bp383.txt
Florid brothers who lynched another Negro because of a,bp383.txt
traffic accident have been freed.,bp383.txt
Case hardened Americans will pay little attention to these,bp383.txt

that only the unified protest of thousands of voters will force,bp383.txt

be voted upon by the house and sent to the senate.,bp383.txt

"an anti-lynching law, despite the fact that the circumstances of the",bp424.txt
Duck Hill lynching prove the impotence of such laws to prevent lynch-,bp424.txt
ing. The theory of anti-lynching laws is twofold. Pecuniary penalties,bp424.txt
imposed on communities for lynchings are supposed to restrain the,bp424.txt
lynching urge. But what would a consideration like that have amounted,bp424.txt
in the case of the infuriated mob at Duck Hill. The other part of,bp424.txt
the theory of anti-lynching laws is that by transferring the investiga-,bp424.txt
lion cf lynchings and the trial of offenders to outside tribunals such as,bp424.txt
"federal courts, punishment can be had regardless of local public opinion",bp424.txt
or political pull. History is emphatic as to the fallacy of that. So far as,bp424.txt
"the South is concerned, lynching got its greatest impetus at a time when",bp424.txt
"military rule and federal force laws were in full flower, and in the",bp424.txt
nineties of the last century when the Lodge force bill was being pressed,bp424.txt
"in Congress, lynching was rampant. In northern states where there are",bp424.txt
laws providing for the recovery of damages from counties and local,bp424.txt
"communities by relatives of mob victims, there have been most atro-",bp424.txt
cious mob murders.,bp424.txt
Sincere purpose to abate lynchings is almost entirely absent from the,bp424.txt
present propaganda for a federal anti-lynching law. Back of that move-,bp424.txt
ment-as every literate adult knows-are four elements.,bp424.txt
(1) The remnant of the old Republican party machine seeking des-,bp424.txt
perately to recover the Negro vote in the northern states through which,bp424.txt
"it ruled the nation from the election of 1868, in which that vote first",bp424.txt
swung the balance.,bp424.txt
(2) The Democratic political machines in big cities bidding against,bp424.txt
the G. O. P. for the same bloc vote.,bp424.txt
(3) The Communist groups who have sought for more than 15 years,bp424.txt
to stir up racial strife North and South.,bp424.txt
(4) The strangely assorted groups of psychopaths who take a morbid,bp424.txt
interest in lynchings and in characteristic crimes that lead to lynchings.,bp424.txt
These groups include many queer fish and epicene neurotics who swim,bp424.txt
in the stagnant social pools which have collected back of some of the,bp424.txt
great foundations and other endowments set up by doddering old men,bp424.txt
and women who had more money than sense.,bp424.txt
The latter elements are not motivated at all by any desire to abate,bp424.txt
lynchings. The heavily financed propaganda against the social order of,bp424.txt
the South which was manifested in the Scottsboro case in Alabama and,bp424.txt
in the Herndon case in Atlanta are a dead giveaway as to that. An,bp424.txt
orderly court trial in the South stirs up the degenerate martyr com-,bp424.txt
plexes of these people as much as a lynching.,bp424.txt
In view of the South baiting that accompanies all the agitation for,bp424.txt
"federal anti-lynching laws, it is incumbent upon southern senators and",bp424.txt
representatives to make these facts clear upon the floors of the Houses,bp424.txt

LYNCHING AND “THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE” AND “ THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE ”,bp449.txt
(From The Arizona Daily Star) From The Arizona Daily Star),bp449.txt
After the recent lynching of two Negro boys in Texas the county,bp449.txt
attorney of the county in which the act took place justified the act,bp449.txt
"on the grounds that it ""represented the will of the people."" For",bp449.txt
"an officer of the law charged with protecting life under the law,",bp449.txt
for an official trained and educated in the need of lawful processes,bp449.txt
"in civilized life, to condone such an act is bad enough, but for him",bp449.txt
"to justify it on the spurious grounds that it ""represented the will of",bp449.txt

"fraught with future danger, that it demands an immediate challenge,",bp449.txt
and an explanation of possible consequences.,bp449.txt
"The safety of all people, not merely that of the Negroes is at",bp449.txt

"cause it ""represents the will of the people,"" it can be used to justify",bp449.txt
an infinite variety of other acts Down through the centuries of,bp449.txt
"history ""the will of the peoplé"" has been used to justify hideous and",bp449.txt
"monstrous crimes. Even Pilate surrendered Christ, because the mob",bp449.txt
"demanded it. In Germany today, ""the will of the people"" is used",bp449.txt
to excuse the cruel punishment of those who merely express different,bp449.txt
"political opinions, and to justify the shameful treatinent of another",bp449.txt

"only last May, 117 individuals were summarily executed, because",bp449.txt
they were accused of having different political beliefs than the rul-,bp449.txt
ing hierarchy. And all of these acts were done because they repre-,bp449.txt
"sented ""the will of the people.""",bp449.txt
This is a serious matter. Many of us lightly gloss over it be-,bp449.txt
cause we do not stop to think of its possible consequences-because,bp449.txt
we have not suffered. But the founders of our country and their,bp449.txt
ancestors in England knew from personal experience and personal,bp449.txt
"sufferings how ""the will of the people"" as expressed mob action,",bp449.txt
can be used to justify oppression. And it was largely from this per-,bp449.txt
sonal experience and personal knowledge that they adopted a written,bp449.txt
constitution as a basic means of protecting themselves and their pos-,bp449.txt
terity from the arbitrary action sponsored by mob rule. Mobs that,bp449.txt
"today lynch Negroes, can later be diverted to lynch other people who",bp449.txt
might dare to express independent thought.,bp449.txt
Most certainly the execution of these two Negro boys did not,bp449.txt
"""represent the will of the people."" It represented the passions of",bp449.txt
the people aroused to beast intensity. If those Texas people only,bp449.txt
realized how the precedent they established might at some time re-,bp449.txt
"turn to plague` them, to justify the act of another kind of mob in",bp449.txt
"depriving them of certain rights or even of their lives, they would",bp449.txt

"take its course. Assume that the two boys were guilty, they were en-",bp449.txt
"titled to a fair trial, and the protection of the federal constitution.",bp449.txt
The time has come when this shameful blot on American life,bp449.txt
"must be removed. When State authorities refuse to give protection,",bp449.txt
when they brazenly justify the denial of constitutional rights to the,bp449.txt
"weak and penniless, it becomes the duty of the federal government",bp449.txt
"to assert itself. When bok and daring gangsters, by kidnaping and",bp449.txt
"bank robberies, assaulted the citadels of wealth and power, the fed-",bp449.txt
eral government acted with alacrity. It raised and trained an en-,bp449.txt
tirely new force of anforcement officials. Why cannot this same ma-,bp449.txt
chinery be used to defend the constitutional rights of the weak and,bp449.txt
friendless? A few.prison terms for mob leaders would soon bring,bp449.txt
a halt to this barbaric action.,bp449.txt
The safety of all people is at stake. American principles of gov-,bp449.txt
ernment with their protection of life and property is at stake. The,bp449.txt
"beastly and hocdlum passions of a mob do not represent ""the will of",bp449.txt

The razor which Ms. Cosby,bp466.txt
claimed that she was cut with was,bp466.txt
examined under microscopic tests,bp466.txt
and it was found that there were,bp466.txt
no finger prints other than her,bp466.txt

for the alleged assailant continued,bp466.txt
in spite of the strong belief that,bp466.txt
the woman had used this story,bp466.txt
of attack for another purpose.,bp466.txt
According to Mrs. Cosby's story,bp466.txt
she was attacked around 6:15 A. M.,bp466.txt
a few minutes after her husband,bp466.txt
had left to go to work in the,bp466.txt

as being a tall mullatto. with al,bp466.txt

description. Mining authorities how,bp466.txt
ever expressed their belief in his,bp466.txt
innocence and he was released.,bp466.txt
Mrs. Cosby after being examined,bp466.txt
was not found to be,bp466.txt
raped and,bp466.txt
little confidence was placed in her,bp466.txt
story by deputies assigned to the,bp466.txt
case. Bloodhounds brought to the!,bp466.txt
scene of the alleged attack failed,bp466.txt
to get the tracks of the attacker.,bp466.txt
Approximately 350 miners who had,bp466.txt
just entered the mines to go to,bp466.txt
work came out to join in the mob,bp466.txt

MURDER IN MISSISSIPPI,bp497.txt
Again has the frequently besmirched name of Mississipppi,bp497.txt
been plunged into the muck of barbarism and savagery. With,bp497.txt
"the lynching of to Negroes near Alligator, in Bolivar county,",bp497.txt
"Friday, Mississippi again indicates that its respect for law and",bp497.txt
order is nil.,bp497.txt
The victims of mob murder were charged with having at-,bp497.txt
tempted an attack on a white woman. This may or may not,bp497.txt
have been true. The circumstances were such as to have cast,bp497.txt
doubt that there had been an attempted attack. That may come,bp497.txt
out later.,bp497.txt
But it is a fact that the mob took the two Negroes from,bp497.txt
three arred officers without a struggle. There broke down the,bp497.txt
"law. The officers had no interest, no will in stopping that mob",bp497.txt
or it would have been stopped.,bp497.txt
"For a contrast, Sheriff Newbhill of Dyer county, Tenn.,",bp497.txt
heard rumors that a mob was forming to lynch two white pris-,bp497.txt
oners accused of a really grave offense this week. Sheriff,bp497.txt
Newbill of Tennessee did not wait to find out even if the rumor,bp497.txt
were true. He took his prisoners in a fast car and brought,bp497.txt
them to Memphis to the Shelby county jail. No lynching took,bp497.txt
place. It is reasonable to believe that Sheriff Newbill would,bp497.txt
have taken the same course had his prisoners been Negrocs. And,bp497.txt
it also seems quite likely that Sherifi Newbill would not have,bp497.txt
surrendered any prisoner to a mob without a fight.,bp497.txt
As a result of the conduct of this courageous and dutiful,bp497.txt
"officer, Tennessee's escutcheon is unmarked, where it could",bp497.txt
have casily been fouled for all the world to see and shulder at.,bp497.txt
It is a well and generally known fact that almost any sort,bp497.txt
"of resistance on the part of peace officers will ſoil a moh, which",bp497.txt
"is innately cowardly Any display of determination, as has",bp497.txt
"been proved time and again by men of courage, will disperse a",bp497.txt
"mob, however blood-thirsty it may seem at the time",bp497.txt
Hence it is a natural assumption that when a peace officer,bp497.txt
allows himself to be disarmed by a mob and his prisoner taken,bp497.txt
"from him without any struggle, that either one of two things is |",bp497.txt
"true: The first is that the officer is an arrant coward, and the",bp497.txt
second that he just doesn't give a damn.,bp497.txt
There should be a national law concerning lynchings-a,bp497.txt
law which would punish every peace officer in the county in,bp497.txt
"which a lynching took place, and also render that county sub-",bp497.txt
ject to a heavy Federal penalty for allowing it. President,bp497.txt
"Roosevelt, humanitarian that he is, should foster such a law,",bp497.txt
for only with such sure protection can this nation ever emerge,bp497.txt
from the lawlessness which grips it now.,bp497.txt
Mobs are no respectors of persons. Race means nothing,bp497.txt
"to a moh, if it is allowed to have its way. Our courts, our laws.",bp497.txt
the very machinery of our civilization breaks down horribly,bp497.txt
"every time there is a lynching, and all the soft talk about the",bp497.txt
chastity of the white women cannot alter this one iota. Few,bp497.txt
"people feel that a rapist should not be punished by death, for",bp497.txt
rape is a heinous offense. But we have laws and we have,bp497.txt
"courts, and we are, allegedly, a civilized people. Whenever we",bp497.txt
"condone the work of an irresponsible inob which, after its",bp497.txt
formation secks blood-anybody's blood-then we take a hun-,bp497.txt
"dred, nay a thousand, steps backward in the progress of a sup-",bp497.txt
posedly enlightened and cultured people.,bp497.txt
"Let us have laws which will, for all time, stop this horrid",bp497.txt
"effense against human decency, and against law and order",bp497.txt
There is talk of a law which will make the sheriff of any county,bp497.txt
in Tennessee lose his job automatically once a lynching takes,bp497.txt
place in his territory. Pray God that such a law may be passed,bp497.txt
"in this State and in every state in the Union, for there are few",bp497.txt
peace officers who would not fight a mob to retain their jobs-,bp497.txt
"and if mobs are fought, they are defeated.",bp497.txt
"Shelby county believes in the orderly processes of the law,",bp497.txt
Sheby county is the home of the proposed law cited above.,bp497.txt
Shelby county citizens should be glad that they live in a district,bp497.txt
where respect for the law is high. They should rejoice that they,bp497.txt
"do not live in Bolivar county, Mississippi, where there is no such",bp497.txt
respect And they should foster in every way possible laws,bp497.txt
"that will make lynching a real crime, punishable by law, rather",bp497.txt
than a sport in which a gang of drunken hoodlums engage with-,bp497.txt
out fear in the hilarious pastime of murder.,bp497.txt

The Mississippi Senate passed a special law to,bp500.txt

conviction by the court. The House of Represen-,bp500.txt
"tatives killed the bill in Committee,",bp500.txt
"The question comes, how did the authorities",bp500.txt

"But, imagine a State Senate enacting a law so",bp500.txt

had its fun.,bp500.txt
Here is an unprejudiced report of what hap-,bp500.txt
pened: The sheriff sprang the trap. Issac Howard,bp500.txt
"plunged through the floor. Said the sheriff: ""That",bp500.txt
"bastard won't bother you any more."" Said father",bp500.txt
"of the girl, ""Hell no.""",bp500.txt
In the hall below where the body fell someone,bp500.txt
"said: ""That's Isaac Howard."" Said another, ""You",bp500.txt

later the doctor pronounced,bp500.txt
"Another spiritual began above,",bp500.txt
another body plunged through the trap. A dozen,bp500.txt

"Fickled. ""Look how long his neck is,"" one ex-",bp500.txt
"claimed. ""That's because it is broken.' explained",bp500.txt
an officer. Again the girls giggled. The doctor,bp500.txt

Thus the spectacle went on for over an hour,bp500.txt

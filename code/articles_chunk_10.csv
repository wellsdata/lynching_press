Reminiscences of Ben Hill of Georgia.,86050_0.txt
A Southern correspondent relates the following,86050_0.txt
incidents in the career of the late,86050_0.txt
Senator Ben H. Hill: In 1855 Mr. Hill declared,86050_0.txt
himself a candidate for congress in the,86050_0.txt
"Fourth Congressional District, and at an in",86050_0.txt

Mr. Hill was in reality the candidate of the,86050_0.txt
"American or"" Knownothing"" party, which",86050_0.txt
had just taken shape in Georgia. He was op.,86050_0.txt
"posed by ex- Chief Justice Hiram Warner, of",86050_0.txt
"Greenville, who ran as the nominee of the",86050_0.txt
Democratic party. The race was warm and,86050_0.txt
"closely contested, Warner winning by the",86050_0.txt
"trifling majority of 66 votes in a district which,",86050_0.txt
"prior to that time, was accustomed to roll",86050_0.txt
"up democratic majority of 2,500 votes. In",86050_0.txt
1856 Hill was placed on the electoral ticket,86050_0.txt

"that his wonderful powers on the"" hustings""",86050_0.txt

new great man who had literally laid him out,86050_0.txt
on his own stamping ground that he forth,86050_0.txt
with challenged him. In reply Hill wrote that,86050_0.txt

A MIDNIGHT,86052_0.txt
"HERMANN, MO., June 5.- The city was",86052_0.txt
thrown into a state of intense excitement,86052_0.txt
shortly after midnight this morning by,86052_0.txt
"the lynching of Whitney, the murderer of",86052_0.txt
young Barcher. The mob numbered 200.,86052_0.txt
"They surrounded the jail, guards being",86052_0.txt
stationed with drawn revolvers to keep,86052_0.txt
back the curious crowd which was attracted,86052_0.txt
by the noise in beating in the jail doors.,86052_0.txt
"The jailer refused to surrender the keys,",86052_0.txt
when axes where brought,86052_0.txt
. Whitney,86052_0.txt
sup,86052_0.txt
"posed the purpose of the assault, and",86052_0.txt
crouched in his cell floor and prayed,86052_0.txt
fervently. His voice could be heard out,86052_0.txt
side. The jailer was forced to lead the,86052_0.txt
"way to Whitney's cell, which was then",86052_0.txt
forced open; a long rope the men had,86052_0.txt
brought with them was put around the,86052_0.txt
waist of the half fainting doomed man. He,86052_0.txt
fell on his knees when once in the open,86052_0.txt
air and asked leave to pray again. This,86052_0.txt
"was granted, but as he continued his appeals",86052_0.txt
"to heaven too long, he was jerked to",86052_0.txt
his feet and dragged through town into a,86052_0.txt
"dense woods that covers the bluff, a dozen",86052_0.txt
of the lynching party warning the crowd,86052_0.txt
"not to follow, and intimidating them by a",86052_0.txt
display of revolvers. It was expected the,86052_0.txt
court would hold a special session to try,86052_0.txt
"the accused, but when it was announced",86052_0.txt
yesterday that the trial would go over to,86052_0.txt
"the fall term, the indignation was general,",86052_0.txt
and threats of lynching were made. It,86052_0.txt
was quite an orderly mob in its behavior.,86052_0.txt
In the absence of the conventional masks.,86052_0.txt
many of the lynchers were recognized.,86052_0.txt
The last seen of Whitney he was being,86052_0.txt
taken into the wood by the lyuchers. Ere,86052_0.txt
this he is dead.,86052_0.txt
When the woods were reached the prisoner,86052_0.txt
was handed over to a dozen masked,86052_0.txt
men. He said his real named was Fisher,86052_0.txt
and not Whitney; that his parents lived in,86052_0.txt
Virginia. He did not know whether he,86052_0.txt
"killed Burchard or not, as he and his partner",86052_0.txt
", whose name was Collier, fired five",86052_0.txt
shots each. He then shook hands with a,86052_0.txt
"part of the mob, bidding them good bye,",86052_0.txt
after which he was strung to a tree. The,86052_0.txt

Ellis was at Gleason's house when the latter,86054_0.txt
left for Rutland. Gleason owes Ellis money.,86054_0.txt

that the lock had been broken.,86079_0.txt
Coleman was dragged forth and lynched,86079_0.txt

"and a farmer named Barney Britt, who",86155_0.txt
had served together in the 19th regiment.,86155_0.txt
Yesterday morning they met upon the,86155_0.txt
streets and some violent language passed,86155_0.txt
between them. In the afternoon they,86155_0.txt
"met again, and Spain went to his residence",86155_0.txt
", procured his revolver, and shot",86155_0.txt
Britt dead. The murderer was at once,86155_0.txt
"arrested. A mob soon( 3 gathered, and",86155_0.txt
threatened summary punishment. They,86155_0.txt
"were baulked for a time by the officers,",86155_0.txt

To the Editor of The Star:,86162_0.txt
I wonder how many people know that the,86162_0.txt
proposed antilynching legislation provides for,86162_0.txt
the payments of large sums of money by the,86162_0.txt
taxpayers to the heirs of persons lynched.,86162_0.txt
"The result of such legislation would be, in",86162_0.txt
"many cases, to richly reward accessories after",86162_0.txt
"the fact, in some of the most heinous crimes",86162_0.txt
imaginable.,86162_0.txt
It is well known that in many rape cases the,86162_0.txt
"criminals have been protected by relatives, who",86162_0.txt
have fed them while hiding out and who have,86162_0.txt
lied to the officers of the law as to their knowledge,86162_0.txt
of their whereabouts. If such criminals,86162_0.txt
were captured and lynched the very relatives,86162_0.txt
who had tried to thwart the law would be en,86162_0.txt
titled to receive from the county in which the,86162_0.txt
lynching occurred sums of money ranging,86162_0.txt
into thousands of dollars. up,86162_0.txt
If the groups that are pressing for the enactment,86162_0.txt
of this legislation were half as much,86162_0.txt
concerned over the fact that two small girls,86162_0.txt
recently were dragged from their bicycles in,86162_0.txt

"protecting the criminals, there would be much",86162_0.txt
"better feeling between the races, and ours",86162_0.txt
would be a much safer community in which to,86162_0.txt
live. If Congress yields to the anti- lynching,86162_0.txt
"proposal, it will have no cause to complain if",86162_0.txt
crime gets totally out of hand. It already nearly,86162_0.txt

Monday after the sewers had been closed;,86217_0.txt
the bottom referred to is the lowest place,86217_0.txt

the reduced rate of postage had made but,86217_0.txt
very little difference in the receipts of the,86217_0.txt
office during this first quarter. He believes,86217_0.txt
"that, at the end of the year, if not sooner,",86217_0.txt
the receipts purely from local business will,86217_0.txt
be as much as they were before the reduc,86217_0.txt

"makes no change in the postal law, reduc",86217_0.txt
the amount of receipts necessary to en,86217_0.txt
title a community to such a system. The,86217_0.txt
reason why the reduction in postage has,86217_0.txt
had so little effect upon the receipts of the,86217_0.txt
office here is that there has been an increase,86217_0.txt
in the demand for stamps of the larger,86217_0.txt
denomination. Business men who do,86217_0.txt
much of their advertising with circulars,86217_0.txt

promptly into the waste basket without,86217_0.txt

in allowing lawless elements,86261_1.txt
to believe themselves free to lynch,86261_1.txt
and burn Negroes without fear of,86261_1.txt
swift and certain punishment. Your,86261_1.txt
State cannot sit back and say as you,86261_1.txt
have in the past that your laws are,86261_1.txt
inadequate to punish lynchers. We,86261_1.txt
implore you in the name of our common,86261_1.txt
country to exhaust every resource,86261_1.txt
"of law, money and patriotic endeavor",86261_1.txt
to stem the peril which these burnings,86261_1.txt

to the country as a whole lest such,86261_1.txt
outrages be regarded as an attack by,86261_1.txt
the white elements of our population,86261_1.txt
upon the Colored. I need not point,86261_1.txt
out to you the patriotic duty owed by,86261_1.txt
every American in such a crisis as,86261_1.txt

THE MOB SPIRIT AND THE LAW,86293_0.txt
Recent dispatches from various parts of the,86293_0.txt
United States indicate an increasing tendency,86293_0.txt
to resort to mob law for the purpose of wreaking,86293_0.txt
summary vengeance on a prisoner who is,86293_0.txt
either awaiting trial or under sentence of death,86293_0.txt
for some serious crime.,86293_0.txt
This manifestation of a lawless spirit is not,86293_0.txt
confined to any special section of the country.,86293_0.txt
It has asserted itself of late in communities,86293_0.txt
long noted for the law- abiding character of,86293_0.txt
"their people, and, it is therefore all the more to",86293_0.txt
be reprehended. One of the latest instances,86293_0.txt
is reported from an old- fashioned Massachu,86293_0.txt
setts town where the authorities were compelled,86293_0.txt
to resort to extraordinary precautions,86293_0.txt
to prevent a mob from breaking jail and lynching,86293_0.txt
three culprits charged with grave crimes.,86293_0.txt
In the Massachusetts case the prisoners were,86293_0.txt
"in jail awaiting trial, and it was safe to assume",86293_0.txt
that the courts would deal with them according,86293_0.txt
to their deserts. But the impatient mob,86293_0.txt
"wanted vengeance, ont justice, and was eager",86293_0.txt
to subordinate the ordinary processes of civilization,86293_0.txt
to its own primitive and savage notions,86293_0.txt
of right.,86293_0.txt
It can not be too emphatically asserted that,86293_0.txt

An inquest was held on the body and,86371_1.txt
the negro was arrested. As the officer,86371_1.txt

he was overpowered about three- fourths,86371_1.txt

The sheriff and nis deputies were,86372_0.txt

The rope used was so long that the,86372_0.txt
length of the drop given him caused,86372_0.txt

News has been received of a lynching,86372_1.txt
"at Newcastle, Wyo., last Tuesday",86372_1.txt
night. The mob is claimed to have,86372_1.txt
been composed cf ranchers from,86372_1.txt
Gillette and vicinity and the victim,86372_1.txt
"of its vengeance was W. C. Clifton,",86372_1.txt
"who according to his own confession,",86372_1.txt
was a double murderer.,86372_1.txt
Clifton was awaiting trial for the,86372_1.txt
"killing of John W. Church and wife,",86372_1.txt
who lived on a ranch about 75 miles,86372_1.txt
southwest of Newcastle.,86372_1.txt
The last time the couple were seen,86372_1.txt
"alive was March 14, last. April 7",86372_1.txt
"Clifton, whose ranch adjoined theirs,",86372_1.txt
was arrested on suspicion of having,86372_1.txt
murdered them and several days after,86372_1.txt
ward he made a confession in which,86372_1.txt
he admitted that he killed Church,86372_1.txt
"and his wife, but claimed that it was",86372_1.txt
done in self defense. He told where,86372_1.txt
he had concealed the bodies and they,86372_1.txt
were found at the place indicated.,86372_1.txt
In relating the occurrences that ended,86372_1.txt
in the murder he said that he had,86372_1.txt
given Church a bili of sale covering,86372_1.txt
personal property to secure payment,86372_1.txt
of$ 600 which Church had advanced,86372_1.txt
him. He claimed that he repaid,86372_1.txt
Church and had obtained return of,86372_1.txt
"the bill of sale, but Mrs. Church had",86372_1.txt
threatened him with a revolver and,86372_1.txt
demanded that he give the bill back.,86372_1.txt
He admitted that he shot the woman,86372_1.txt
and then being attacked by the,86372_1.txt
husband shot and killed him also.,86372_1.txt
"story was not believed, as Mrs.",86372_1.txt
"His Church was a delicate, little woman",86372_1.txt
General's office shows that there is no,86373_0.txt
excuse for these lynchings on the ground,86373_0.txt
that murderers or other criminals escape,86373_0.txt
"through the law. During the year, twenty",86373_0.txt
three prisoners have been tried for capita!,86373_0.txt
offences and condemned to death; and in,86373_0.txt
only two cases have there been commutations,86373_0.txt
. In the last twenty months there,86373_0.txt
have been eighty- five prisoners condemned,86373_0.txt
to death or life imprisonment in Texas.,86373_0.txt

Governors in endeavoring to suppress,86373_0.txt
lynelings. It is a far more difficult task,86373_0.txt
"than it may seem, and the anti- lynching",86373_0.txt
accomplished far lees,86373_0.txt
Governors have,86373_0.txt
"than was expected, although they have",86373_0.txt
worked earnest in this cause.,86373_0.txt
No one could have been more earnest in,86373_0.txt
his efforts to break up lyneling in Missis-,86373_0.txt
sippi than Gov. Longino. He has discussed,86373_0.txt
it in every message to the Legislature,86373_0.txt
. He himself has gone to the county,86373_0.txt
seat when a lynching was expected. He,86373_0.txt
has ordered out troops whenever necessary,86373_0.txt
and has upheld and supported the Judges,86373_0.txt
in their opposition to mobs.,86373_0.txt
He did all in his power to secure action,86373_0.txt
by the Crand Juries against lynchers and,86373_0.txt
has worked in every possible way to stop,86373_0.txt
Yet he has at best saved,86373_0.txt
the disgrace.,86373_0.txt
"four or five tives, while that horrible ed",86373_0.txt
dition to lynching burning at the stake,86373_0.txt
"proviously unknown in Mississippi, has",86373_0.txt
finally invaded the State and was the fear,86373_0.txt
ure of the recent Corinth lynching.,86373_0.txt
Theas who oppose lynching call attention,86373_0.txt
"to the fact that it is progressive, going",86373_0.txt
through an evolution of horrors. When,86373_0.txt
the mob first began this work in Mississippi,86373_0.txt
the lynching was done by a small body of,86373_0.txt
"men, well organized, masked and on horse",86373_0.txt
"back, who rode to the jail in the middle of",86373_0.txt
the night and compelled the Sheriff to,86373_0.txt
surrender the prisoner. He was taken to,86373_0.txt
the nearest tree and hanged.,86373_0.txt
"The next chang, a needlessly brutal",86373_0.txt
"one, was after hanging the negro to have",86373_0.txt
every momb r of the mob fira a rifle,86373_0.txt
or pistol at the body This practice has,86373_0.txt
"been kept up sine, with the result that the",86373_0.txt
bodies of lynched negroes to- day- nt lenst,86373_0.txt
been burned- sre,86373_0.txt
scare ly distinguisable fot as those of human,86373_0.txt
The more conservative citizens pleaded,86373_1.txt
"for a plain hanging"" and were regarded",86373_1.txt
as milksops for so doing.,86373_1.txt
No one seemed to plead law and order,86373_1.txt
for the trial and legal execution of the,86373_1.txt
criminal. The mob even took possession,86373_1.txt
"of the telegraph station, refused to allow",86373_1.txt
the Sheriff to telegraph to the Governor,86373_1.txt
"for troops, and refused to allow any word",86373_1.txt
of the lynching to go out until the work,86373_1.txt
was completed. It armed itself to resist,86373_1.txt
any troops that might be sent to the scene,86373_1.txt
to maintain the law.,86373_1.txt
It has been found that when burn ing,86373_1.txt
at the stake is once introduced as an incident,86373_1.txt
"to lynching, it is generally kept up.",86373_1.txt
The evil influence of the Corinth burning,86373_1.txt
was well shown in the very next lynching,86373_1.txt
"in Mississippi, at Darling, on All Saints",86373_1.txt
"Day, Nov. 1, when the negro victim was",86373_1.txt
burned at the stake.,86373_1.txt
"It will be seen, therefore, that lynchings",86373_1.txt
are going through an evolution which makes,86373_1.txt
them worse. The increased boldness of,86373_1.txt
the lyn hers wes well shown in the Hemp,86373_1.txt
"stead: air, where, for the first time, a pris",86373_1.txt

the fact that he is tackling a difficult problem,86373_1.txt
which may prove too much for the,86373_1.txt

to the conclusion that a negro,86402_0.txt
criminal is in just as much danger of,86402_0.txt
being lynched in the North as in the,86402_0.txt
South. This statement is based upon,86402_0.txt
the comments of some of the Northern,86402_0.txt
papers on the recent lynching in,86402_0.txt
"Springfield, 0. In these comments it",86402_0.txt
is admitted that the lynchings are,86402_0.txt
based upon race hostility. White men,86402_0.txt
not,86402_0.txt
who commit similar crimes are,86402_0.txt
lynched.,86402_0.txt
that,86402_0.txt
And it is a safe proposition,86402_0.txt
white men in the North are just as,86402_0.txt
ready to lynch a negro as white men,86402_0.txt
in the South are. On Sunday a most,86402_0.txt
took place at,86402_0.txt
outrageous lynching,86402_0.txt
"Springfield, O. And the authorities",86402_0.txt
were not nearly so active and efficient,86402_0.txt
in their efforts to prevent the,86402_0.txt
outrage as is generally the case when,86402_0.txt
lynching is threatened in a Southern,86402_0.txt
state a.,86402_0.txt
Yesterday an attempt was made to,86402_0.txt
"lynch a negro at Murphysboro, Ill. It",86402_0.txt
was charged that he had attempted,86402_0.txt
to assault a woman. The officers dis,86402_0.txt
played more courage than was shown,86402_0.txt
"by the officers at Springfield, and the",86402_0.txt
mob dispersed. We have said,86402_0.txt
many,86402_0.txt
"times, and the foregoing cases justify",86402_0.txt
"us in repeating it, that the race",86402_0.txt
feeling at the North is just as strong,86402_0.txt
"as it is in the South, and that a negro",86402_0.txt
charged with a heinous offense is in,86402_0.txt
just as much danger of being lynched,86402_0.txt
in one section as in the other.,86402_0.txt
The,86402_0.txt
only reason more negroes are lynched,86402_0.txt
in the South than in the North is that,86402_0.txt
there are many times more negroes in,86402_0.txt
the South and they commit more offenses,86402_0.txt
of the kind that arouse the mob,86402_0.txt
spirit.,86402_0.txt
There is a steadily increasing negro,86402_0.txt
"population in many parts of the North,",86402_0.txt
and it is noticeable that wherever the,86402_0.txt
negro population is increasing in that,86402_0.txt
section the number of lynchings is,86402_0.txt
"increasing. Indeed, it is not too much",86402_0.txt
to say that if the percentage of the,86402_0.txt
negro population in the North were as,86402_0.txt
large as it is in the South there would,86402_0.txt
be more lynchings there than there,86402_0.txt
are here.,86402_0.txt
20.20.3.7.,86402_0.txt
The Northern people have it in their,86402_0.txt
"minds, however, that negroes are lynched",86402_0.txt
only in the South. It is about time,86402_0.txt
they admitted to themselves the truth.,86402_0.txt
The race feeling is even more strongly,86402_0.txt
developed among them than among,86402_0.txt
the people of the South. There will,86402_0.txt
be a steady increase in the number,86402_0.txt
"of negro lynchings in the North, and",86402_0.txt
the Northern people might as well,86402_0.txt
"admit now as later on, that they are",86402_0.txt
not in a position to condemn the people,86402_0.txt
of the South for lynching negroes.,86402_0.txt
Here in the South the press takes every,86402_0.txt
opportunity to condemn lynchings and,86402_0.txt
to urge that the law be permitted to,86402_0.txt
take its course. Almost without exception,86402_0.txt
"officers of the law, from the",86402_0.txt
"governors down to the sheriffs,",86402_0.txt
use,86402_0.txt
their utmost endeavors to prevent and,86402_0.txt
check lynchings. The Northern people,86402_0.txt
are having frequent opportunities,86402_0.txt
to prove they can do more to put a,86402_0.txt
stop to lynchings. The South,86402_0.txt
will give negro them credit for all they do.,86402_0.txt
SINCE several negroes were lynched and one,86403_0.txt
"burnt at the stake in the South during the past week,",86403_0.txt
the Northern press has been rather severe in ridiculing,86403_0.txt
the prevailing code of morals below the Mason and,86403_0.txt
Dixon line. The South has its shortcomings. So,86403_0.txt
has the North. It is incomprehensible to the South-,86403_0.txt
ern man's sense of justice when we sentence a man,86403_0.txt
to prison for five years who has only stolen a few,86403_0.txt
"dollars, and then give the man who has stolen two",86403_0.txt
hundred thousand a similar sentence. They cannot,86403_0.txt
"understand this. But then, there is a large number",86403_0.txt
of people who do not live in the South who,86403_0.txt
to comprehend this procedure. fail,86403_0.txt

"which determined to lynch him, approached",86407_0.txt

men within the past few weeks and,86407_0.txt
of this latest outrage,86407_0.txt
the news,86407_0.txt
caused intense excitement. Early in,86407_0.txt
the evening crowds gathered in the,86407_0.txt
streets. he crowd was,86407_0.txt
down- town,86407_0.txt
harangued by several speakers who,86407_0.txt
urged them to take the life of the negro,86407_0.txt
if he could be found and in a,86407_0.txt
time the entire crowd was on,86407_0.txt
the short march for the jail.,86407_0.txt
man they were seeking was not in the,86407_1.txt
jail and never had been brought there,86407_1.txt
He offered to let anybody whom he,86407_1.txt
personally knew pass through the jaii,86407_1.txt
to satisfy the crowd of the truth of his,86407_1.txt
statement. About forty men walked,86407_1.txt
"through the corridors, some of them",86407_1.txt
returning and assuring the members,86407_1.txt
of the mob that the man was not,86407_1.txt
"there. While several men, including",86407_1.txt
"Hoyle and Lyons, were still in the",86407_1.txt
"jail, a portion of the crowd seized a",86407_1.txt
telephone pole that had been blown,86407_1.txt
down in the recent storm and smashed,86407_1.txt
in the jail door and almost instantly,86407_1.txt
a shot came from a revolver in the,86407_1.txt
hands of a man standing in the gate.,86407_1.txt
At once the members of the mob,86407_1.txt
commenced a fusillade. Not more,86407_1.txt
than a dozen men took part in the firing,86407_1.txt
and as the shots rang out there,86407_1.txt
was a stampede on the part of the,86407_1.txt
crowd for shelter. The mob was,86407_1.txt
widely scattered and in a few seconds,86407_1.txt
"Alderman I yons, who had been on the",86407_1.txt
"inside of the jail, came out and, holding",86407_1.txt
"up his hand, from which the blood",86407_1.txt
"was streaming, announced that he had",86407_1.txt
been shot and that Hoyle had received,86407_1.txt

things are rapidly coming to pass these days. Last week it was Georgia,86470_0.txt

necessary.,86470_0.txt
A sheriff in Georgia prevented the lynching of a Negro at the expense,86470_0.txt
of the life of one of the would- be lynchers. Now comes the Governor of,86470_0.txt
Oklahoma who has found mob law so abhorrent during his short tenure,86470_0.txt
of office that he threatens to place the whole state under martial law for,86470_0.txt
the remaining three years of his term unless mob lawlessness ceases at,86470_0.txt
once.,86470_0.txt
The Oklahoma mob like all other mobs had reached the place where,86470_0.txt
it found ready victims in the white race and even descended to the level,86470_0.txt
of whipping children. Like its operations against the black brother in,86470_0.txt
"years past, and not so long ago either, a motive was not always needed to",86470_0.txt
start the mob on its way. Oklahoma mobs were of the mood that some,86470_0.txt
body had to be whipped just as it has followed its other bent that some,86470_0.txt
body had to be lynched. In overstepping the color line the mistake was,86470_0.txt
fatal. The Governor came forth in his majesty and power.,86470_0.txt

"a woman recognized to be that of Mrs. Ford,",86556_1.txt
who was identified by her husband who soon,86556_1.txt
arrived. He remarked that it was his trunk,86556_1.txt
"and wheelbarrow, but requested that it remained",86556_1.txt

revealed that one leg had been chopped off,86556_1.txt

house An immense,86556_1.txt
. throng,86556_1.txt
of people from,86556_1.txt
Laconia and adjoining towns visited the,86556_1.txt
scene during the day. Mrs. Ruddy's life being,86556_1.txt
"uncertain her deposition was taken, which",86556_1.txt
subsequently was as follows: All went to,86556_1.txt
bed about 9 o'clock. At 11 o'clock Samon,86556_1.txt
"came into the front room, went to the win",86556_1.txt
"dow, pulled the curtain one side and",86556_1.txt
looked out. He said he was,86556_1.txt
nervous and,86556_1.txt
could not sleep. She got up and made him,86556_1.txt
a cup of tea and went back to bed. At 4,86556_1.txt
o'clock Samon came into the front room,86556_1.txt
"again, looked out the window and went back",86556_1.txt
into the kitchen. My husband and I got up.,86556_1.txt
He went into the kitchen also. I soon heard,86556_1.txt
"a fall, and going out found my husband hanging",86556_1.txt
over a chair with his arms down. Samon,86556_1.txt
started for me and struck at me with a,86556_1.txt
"hatchet, striking me on the head. I grabbed",86556_1.txt
"his arm, but he struck me and threw me",86556_1.txt
on,86556_1.txt
the floor. He then went into the front room,86556_1.txt
and killed the baby. The baby was crying,86556_1.txt
quite loud. While he was there I tried to,86556_1.txt
"unlock the door, but he was back and struck",86556_1.txt
"me on the head again, knocking me down. I",86556_1.txt
laid perfectly quiet. He then went back into,86556_1.txt
"the front room, got the baby and had come",86556_1.txt
back pouring feathers and straw over us and,86556_1.txt
going out. I got up and went to the front,86556_1.txt
"window, tried to get it up but could not.",86556_1.txt
I,86556_1.txt
then broke a pane of glass and jumped,86556_1.txt
"through. He was very nervous, walking in",86556_1.txt
the kitchen nearly all night. I did not know,86556_1.txt
but the trunk was all right.,86556_1.txt
The coroner's inquest was that the persons,86556_1.txt
came to their death by the hands of Thomas,86556_1.txt
Samon. Where she jumped through the,86556_1.txt
front window and outside were spattered,86556_1.txt
"with bood. Suspicion being against Ford,",86556_1.txt
"husband of the murdered woman, that he",86556_1.txt
"might be implicated in the affair, he was arrested",86556_1.txt
early this morning and still remains,86556_1.txt
in custody. He shows evidence of guilt. He,86556_1.txt
called,86556_1.txt
at neighbor's house,86556_1.txt
last,86556_1.txt
and,86556_1.txt
"evening, leaving the",86556_1.txt
family,86556_1.txt
"bible,",86556_1.txt
remarking that his wife had,86556_1.txt
"gone away with another man, and wished",86556_1.txt
"that they should keep the bible till called for,",86556_1.txt
and if his wife should come and attempt to,86556_1.txt
sell the household goods to immediately let,86556_1.txt

Mrs. Ruddy's injuries consisted of a cut,86556_1.txt
"nearly severing the left wrist, cutting off the",86556_1.txt
"finger and ugly wounds upon the face, neck and",86556_1.txt
back. At Ford's and Samon's there was,86556_1.txt
"no evidence of the murder of Mrs. Ford, yet",86556_1.txt
it is thought that her death was accidental at,86556_1.txt
"the hands of Samon, and that wishing to conceal",86556_1.txt
the body he took it down stairs in a,86556_1.txt
"trunk and thence to Ruddy's and thinking,",86556_1.txt
"perhaps, that he could carry it from the",86556_1.txt
house during the night. Ruddy refused to,86556_1.txt
aid him. When the struggle commenced at,86556_1.txt
five o'clock in the morning another tenant of,86556_1.txt
the Ford and Samon house heard,86556_1.txt
and afterwards loud words which soon rapping sub- 1,86556_1.txt
sided. Friday Mrs. Ford informed her husband,86556_1.txt
that he need not return from Lake Village,86556_1.txt
"that night, a request which he seemed",86556_1.txt
ready to comply with. The supposition is,86556_1.txt
that Mrs. Ford died from strangulation or,86556_1.txt
"being drugged, as she frequently indulged in",86556_1.txt
strong drink. The murderer was captured,86556_1.txt
at two o'clock this afternoon a short distance,86556_1.txt
from Plymouth village on the main road,86556_1.txt
"from Laconia, about 30 miles from the scene",86556_1.txt

"thing to be proud of. In 1918, sixty- two persons were",86579_0.txt
"assassinated in this way, fifty- eight of them being",86579_0.txt
"Negroes and five of them women. Of the total, six",86579_0.txt
teen were killed because they were accused of crimes,86579_0.txt
against women. Fourteen were accused of complicity,86579_0.txt
"in murder, seven of murder, and six of using",86579_0.txt
threats to murder. The total was an increase of,86579_0.txt
"twenty- four over 1917, and all but three of the out",86579_0.txt
rages were perpetrated in southern states.,86579_0.txt
These figures give every American something to,86579_0.txt
"think about. In the beginning, lynching was theoretically",86579_0.txt
resorted to in the south as a retaliation for,86579_0.txt

to indicate that in the districts where nearly,86579_0.txt
all the killings occurred. lynch law is bearing its,86579_0.txt
natural fruit. What was once excused as an extra,86579_0.txt
ordinary proceeding to prevent the commission of a,86579_0.txt
peculiarly heinous offense has become a convenient,86579_0.txt
medium for the gratification of savage revengefulness,86579_0.txt
and barbarous impulse. It has grown to be one of,86579_0.txt
the diversions of the population and obviously is not,86579_0.txt
resorted to in the great majority of cases because,86579_0.txt
there is any feeling that the law will lag or inflict in,86579_0.txt
"adequate penalties, but because the populace prefers",86579_0.txt
to take the law into its own hands.,86579_0.txt
The whole nation is concerned in this condition be,86579_0.txt

are at stake. As long as the lynching bee persists as,86579_0.txt

Nethaway's theatrical and spectacular,86819_0.txt

bringing the lynchers to justice. We,86821_0.txt
believe that such a meeting as this,86821_0.txt
and such action as was taken is unprecedented,86821_0.txt
in the Southland. The,86821_0.txt

RIOT AT CENTREVILLE.- Threatened,86834_0.txt
Lynch Law. We learn that they have had,86834_0.txt
quite a serious disturbance this week in the,86834_0.txt
"usually quiet town of Centreville, Md. It",86834_0.txt
will be remembered that on the 9th of Sep,86834_0.txt
tember last Mr. Wm. H. Porter was brutally,86834_0.txt
murdered on the highway in that county,86834_0.txt
", and that David Seeney, a slave of Mr.",86834_0.txt
"Charles McAllister, was soon after arrested,",86834_0.txt
charged with the perpetration of the deed.,86834_0.txt
A week or two ago he was tried before the,86834_0.txt
"circuit court of Queen Anne's county, and",86834_0.txt
from the evidence elicited the opinion pretty,86834_0.txt
generally prevailed that he would be convicted,86834_0.txt
of murder in the first degree. To,86834_0.txt
"the great surprise, however, of those who",86834_0.txt
"looked for such a verdict, the jury found",86834_0.txt
him guilty only of murder in the second degree,86834_0.txt
", thus sending him to the penitentiary",86834_0.txt
instead of the gallows. The jury of course,86834_0.txt
did not escape immediate censure from the,86834_0.txt
"disappointed, nor was the public feeling in",86834_0.txt
relation to the murder permitted to calm,86834_0.txt
"down. On the contrary, the indignation",86834_0.txt

for the private individuals now to,86963_0.txt
plunder companies that have never done,86963_0.txt
them any harm.,86963_0.txt
THE LEADER has heretofore shown,86963_0.txt
that the cattle companies contribute enormously,86963_0.txt
to the taxable wealth in all the,86963_0.txt
counties of the territory. They pay taxes,86963_0.txt
to a county government for protection and,86963_0.txt
their property should be held as sacred as,86963_0.txt
the property of any private individual.,86963_0.txt
There is no doubt that on the Sweetwater,86963_0.txt
and elsewhere there are men who make a,86963_0.txt
business of stealing cattle. It is an open,86963_0.txt
secret as to who they are in several localities,86963_0.txt
. Assassination of men who are opposed,86963_0.txt
to these rustling practices has been,86963_0.txt
attempted and very many men have been,86963_0.txt
intimidated through threats that their,86963_0.txt
lives would be taken.,86963_0.txt
Dishonestly whether practised by corporations,86963_0.txt
"or individuals, should not be",86963_0.txt
upheld or even countenanced in any,86963_0.txt
county of Wyoming territory. A calf or,86963_0.txt
yearling stolen from a corporation is no,86963_0.txt
less a crime than though it were stolen,86963_0.txt
from an individual. This fact seems to,86963_0.txt
have been lost sight of by jurors who,86963_0.txt
have failed to convict on evidence as plain,86963_0.txt
as day. Lawlessness of any sort is not,86963_0.txt

admission into the Union as a state and,86963_0.txt
the sooner it is suppressed by the strong,86963_0.txt
arm of the law the better it will be for,86963_0.txt
all concerned.,86963_0.txt
Lynch law is rarely justifiable though,86963_0.txt
we have known cases where it was. The,86963_0.txt
trouble with it is that like justice it is,86963_0.txt

Saturday night at the scene of the tragedy.,86968_0.txt
It was a terrible sight which the jurymen,86968_0.txt

road were the bodies of Ripley Johnson,86968_0.txt
"and Mitchell Adams, charged with the",86968_0.txt
murder of Heffernan. On the opposite,86968_0.txt
side were the six bodies of the negroes,86968_0.txt

young Robert Martin. They were tied to,86968_0.txt
trees to the roadside( backs to the sap,86968_0.txt

yet in that brief space of time all the,86970_0.txt

"Georgia, against a mob bent on",87050_0.txt
lynching a negro contrasts strikingly,87050_0.txt
with the course followed in many,87050_0.txt
instances by other peace officers.,87050_0.txt
"At Columbia, Missouri, recently the",87050_0.txt
Sheriff meekly stood aside and let,87050_0.txt
"a mob break into the jail, explaining",87050_0.txt
afterward that he could not have,87050_0.txt
stopped the lynchers and would only,87050_0.txt
have caused needless injury to some,87050_0.txt
of them.,87050_0.txt
"The Savannah officer, though he",87050_0.txt
"had an enraged crowd to deal with,",87050_0.txt
stood his ground. He first had a,87050_0.txt
"fire hose turned on the mob, but",87050_0.txt
this only brought a rain of bricks.,87050_0.txt
He then held the mob at bay until,87050_0.txt
State troops came and mounted,87050_0.txt
machine guns around the jail. The,87050_0.txt
mob did not care to charge under,87050_0.txt
these circumstances.,87050_0.txt
In the annual report of lynchings,87050_0.txt
made by Tuskegee Institute it was,87050_0.txt
recorded that during the last year,87050_0.txt
law officers prevented lynchings in,87050_0.txt
"fifty- eight instances, either by strategy",87050_0.txt
or by force. In four cases they,87050_0.txt
used arms. It probably is,87050_0.txt
not,87050_0.txt
merely a coincidence that in the,87050_0.txt
same year the number of lynchings,87050_0.txt
dropped.,87050_0.txt
Southern sheriffs,87050_0.txt
who resist,87050_0.txt
lynchers do more to hold this evil,87050_0.txt
in check than any single law could,87050_0.txt
do. It is of course their duty to do,87050_0.txt
"so, even at great personal risk, and",87050_0.txt
fortunately there is evidence that,87050_0.txt
the stubbornness of sheriffs in this,87050_0.txt
respect is growing. Any community,87050_0.txt
that desires to do so can stop lynchings,87050_0.txt

movement set in toward the,87054_0.txt
court house.,87054_0.txt

As Martin was dragged through the,87054_0.txt

table and grabbed a large butcher knife,87054_0.txt
"hanging there, with which he wounded",87054_0.txt
two of the leaders of the mob. One,87054_0.txt
"was hurt on the knee, but neither was",87054_0.txt
seriously injured. The knife was wrested,87054_0.txt
from the man's hand and he was,87054_0.txt

to hoist the man up. Someone,87054_0.txt
"climbed the post to the lamp bracket,",87054_0.txt
when the rope was passed over it and,87054_0.txt
a hundred willing hands seized the noose,87054_0.txt
ends and began to draw the negro upward,87054_0.txt
. The rope had been knotted,87054_0.txt
"around his neck, with the knot on the",87054_0.txt
"left side, but at the first tightning of",87054_0.txt
the cord the knotFslipped to the back,87054_0.txt
of the head and Martin hung with his,87054_0.txt
face to the pole. Before the negro had,87054_0.txt
been drawn up the man on the pole had,87054_0.txt
slipped down. An attempt was made,87054_0.txt
to tie the rope to the post and suspend,87054_0.txt
"the body in midair, but the loop refused",87054_0.txt
to hold and the body slid down.,87054_0.txt
"There was a shout to haul him up again,",87054_0.txt

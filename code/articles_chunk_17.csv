The fact that the governor urged Captain,89075_0.txt
"Hay to hurry his report, for his telegram",89075_0.txt
"amounted to that, indicates how",89075_0.txt
vigorously he has determined to act. He,89075_0.txt
will see that everything in his power is,89075_0.txt

United States' Part.,89075_0.txt
It is expected that the United States,89075_0.txt
officials will proceed on the supposition,89075_0.txt
that the action of the mob was in violation,89075_0.txt
of section 5508 of the revised statutes,89075_0.txt
"of the United States, which make it a",89075_0.txt
penalty to form a conspiracy against any,89075_0.txt

further for the punishment of any who,89075_0.txt
"may, by conspiracy, cause the injury of",89075_0.txt

"States, from the northern district of",89075_0.txt

such custody was liable to heavy punishment,89075_0.txt

The supposition is that the United Staes,89075_0.txt

The powers of the state executive are,89075_0.txt
limited in cases of this kind to the punishment,89075_0.txt

"false to their duties. He can, if he thinks",89075_0.txt

any county. It is also within his power,89075_0.txt
to order the courtmartial of any member,89075_0.txt
of the citizen soldiery who fails in,89075_0.txt
his duty. Beyond this he can go no further,89075_0.txt
than to advise with the officials of,89075_0.txt
"the judicial system, and others who may",89075_0.txt
"have, by virtue of the statute, power to",89075_0.txt
punish those who violate any of the laws,89075_0.txt
of the state.,89075_0.txt
In following out these regulations the,89075_0.txt
governor at once ordered Sheriff Rogers,89075_0.txt
and Captain Hay to report all they knew,89075_0.txt
of the lynching. They were to give in,89075_0.txt

"to ascertain, in the case of the sheriff, if",89075_0.txt
"possible, names of members of the mob.",89075_0.txt
In addition to this the governor wrote,89075_0.txt
Judge Speake that he hoped he would,89075_0.txt
proceed as vigorously as possibly in the,89075_0.txt
investigation of the mob and suggested,89075_0.txt
that he call a special session of the,89075_0.txt

"ready to give them to the press, further",89075_0.txt
than to say that he will do everything,89075_0.txt
the laws give him power to do to have,89075_0.txt
the whole matter sifted to the bottom,89075_0.txt

He is waiting the report of Captain,89075_0.txt

Sheriff Rogers which he will not make,89075_0.txt
"public, in which that official gives his",89075_0.txt

that the killing of M. G. Candee near,89075_0.txt
"Choctaw Bluff, in at county, last week",89075_0.txt
is likely to cause a great deal of trouble.,89075_0.txt

now attracting no little attention in,89076_0.txt

The broad question raised in it relates,89076_0.txt
to the fourteenth amendment. A,89076_0.txt
member of the mob that lynched Hor-,89076_0.txt
ace Maples was indicted by a federal,89076_0.txt

offense for which he was indicted is,89076_0.txt
"one against the state of Alabama, not",89076_0.txt
the United States.,89076_0.txt
The contention on the one side is,89076_0.txt
"that, as Horace Maples was a citizen",89076_0.txt
of the United States and was in jail,89076_0.txt
"awiting trial, he could not be deprived",89076_0.txt
"of life without the formality of a trial,",89076_0.txt

of that mob can be punished under,89076_0.txt

murder of a prisoner practically held,89120_0.txt
in the county jail as a witness- a prisoner,89120_0.txt
that a grand jury had practically,89120_0.txt
said was an innocent man. Mr. Jelks,89120_0.txt
has also said that he was ashamed of,89120_0.txt
the action of the mob. But mere expressions,89120_0.txt
and resolutions will accomplish,89120_0.txt
nothing. The mob spirit cannot,89120_0.txt

MUCH STUDY OF,89121_0.txt
HUNTSVILLE CASE,89121_0.txt
Lawyers Deeply Interested in,89121_0.txt
Judge Jones' Charge.,89121_0.txt
A BIG QUESTION RAISED,89121_0.txt
Those Who Agree With Judge Jones,89121_0.txt
Say His Charge Was Made in,89121_0.txt
the Best Interests of,89121_0.txt
the State.,89121_0.txt
In view of the recent widespread discussion,89121_0.txt
of the charge delivered to a federal,89121_0.txt
grand jury at Huntsville by Judge,89121_0.txt
"Thomas G. Jones, in which he held that",89121_0.txt
the mob at that place had violated the,89121_0.txt
"thirteenth amendment to the constitution,",89121_0.txt
and were liable to indictment by a grand,89121_0.txt
"jury in the United States court, many",89121_0.txt
lawyers have given the question much,89121_0.txt
study but as yet there is considerable,89121_0.txt
difference of opinion as to the correctness,89121_0.txt
of the rather unique position.,89121_0.txt
For fear that Judge Jones might be,89121_0.txt
put in a false light before the people of,89121_0.txt
his state some of his friends say that,89121_0.txt
"he is eminently correct in his opinion,",89121_0.txt
and that he delivered the charge for the,89121_0.txt
welfare of the state. They say that he,89121_0.txt
"regrets that he is unable, on account of",89121_0.txt
"his judicial position, to answer some of",89121_0.txt
the attacks on him made in political,89121_0.txt
speeches.,89121_0.txt
Case of Horace Maples.,89121_0.txt
It will be remembered that Judge Jones,89121_0.txt
"took the position that Horace Maples, a",89121_0.txt
"negro, was lynched by a mob of white",89121_0.txt
"men, and calls attention to the fact that",89121_0.txt
"if he had been a white man, it is likely",89121_0.txt
that the law would have been allowed to,89121_0.txt
take its course. If the mob lynched Maples,89121_0.txt
"simply because he was a negro, it is argued",89121_0.txt
that the members thereof violated,89121_0.txt
the thirteenth amendment to the United,89121_0.txt
"States constitution, and are therefore liable",89121_0.txt
to indictment by federal grand juries. In,89121_0.txt
"other words, it is a novel idea of reaching",89121_0.txt
such crimes through the United States,89121_0.txt
"courts, which have heretofore been",89121_0.txt
deemed practically Impossible.,89121_0.txt
Lawyers who agree with the position,89121_0.txt
taken by Judge Jones give their views,89121_0.txt
in substance as follows:,89121_0.txt
Substance of Views.,89121_0.txt
The case of a citizen being taken out,89121_0.txt
"of the hands of the state, which is trying",89121_0.txt
"to afford him due process of law, when",89121_0.txt
"accused of crime, and putting him to",89121_0.txt
"death to prevent his having the right,",89121_0.txt
differs in a constitutional sense and consequence,89121_0.txt
from any other act of mob violence,89121_0.txt
. The citizen had a right or immunity,89121_0.txt
under the constitution to have the,89121_0.txt
"state afford him that protection, and",89121_0.txt
when men conspire to prevent the citizen,89121_0.txt
from being afforded that right they come,89121_0.txt
within section 5508 of the revised statutes,89121_0.txt
for depriving a citizen of the right secured,89121_0.txt
him by the constitution of the,89121_0.txt
United to States.,89121_0.txt
"The kuklux, as many will recall, when",89121_0.txt
they started out were inspired by good,89121_0.txt
"purposes, though effected illegally, but",89121_0.txt
they became plagues to the people and,89121_0.txt
bands of murderers. Finally in Harvey,89121_0.txt
"vs. United States, 106, U. S., the supreme",89121_0.txt
court held the statute about going in,89121_0.txt
"disguise on highways, etc., to be unconstitutional",89121_0.txt
", since it was so broad that it",89121_0.txt
covered assaults to deprive of rights dependent,89121_0.txt
"purely on state laws, as well as",89121_0.txt
those derived directly from the constitutions,89121_0.txt
. They never so intermingled that,89121_0.txt
the courts could not separate them.,89121_0.txt
Supreme Court Reasons.,89121_0.txt
One of the reasons given by the supreme,89121_0.txt
court for holding that the statute was,89121_0.txt
not justified by the Thirteenth amendment,89121_0.txt
"was that under it a"" mob of whites",89121_0.txt
could be indicted for injury to a white,89121_0.txt
"man"" or"" a mob of negroes for injury to",89121_0.txt
"a negro,"" etc. That difficulty does not",89121_0.txt
"arise in the Huntsville cases, nor was the",89121_0.txt
"question presented in any of the cases,",89121_0.txt
whether hanging a man when the state,89121_0.txt
"was trying to protect him, on accusation",89121_0.txt
"of crime, to prevent him having the process",89121_0.txt
"of law, fell within section 5508. The",89121_0.txt
supreme court was careful to state that,89121_0.txt
that was not the case they were deciding.,89121_0.txt
Every lawyer who has studied or knows,89121_0.txt
anything about the jurisprudence of the,89121_0.txt
United States knows that congress has,89121_0.txt
by no means exhausted its power to protect,89121_0.txt
the right of American citizens and,89121_0.txt
every Alabamian is made a citizen of the,89121_0.txt
United States as to matter or which the,89121_0.txt
constitution of the United States provides,89121_0.txt
. Some of the best judges and lawyers,89121_0.txt
in the United States have no doubt,89121_0.txt
that the supreme court will hold that the,89121_0.txt
"present legislation section 5508, covers the",89121_0.txt
case of taking a man from the authorl-,89121_0.txt
ties and putting him to death to prevent,89121_0.txt
"his having a trial, regardless of any",89121_0.txt
question of race- because it deprives him,89121_0.txt
of the enjoyment of an immunity- the,89121_0.txt
constitution confers upon him es a citizen,89121_0.txt
of the United States. Much interesting,89121_0.txt

to help the negro in every way to secure,89124_0.txt
his rights whatever they may be. Turning,89124_0.txt

"Gadsden Bar association, composed of all",89132_0.txt
"the lawyers in the city, held a meeting",89132_0.txt
at the court house this afternoon for the,89132_0.txt
purpose of condemning yesterday's lynching,89132_0.txt
. Strong resolutions denouncing the,89132_0.txt
"murder of Richardson, condemning mob",89132_0.txt
spirit and promising loyalty to the governor,89132_0.txt
were passed by unanimous vote. Ringing,89132_0.txt
speeches were made by Judge J. A.,89132_0.txt
"Billbro, A. E. Goodhue, W. J. Boykin and",89132_0.txt
others.,89132_0.txt
When the committee presented resolutions,89132_0.txt
"the committee chairman. O. R. Hood,",89132_0.txt
"moved their adoption, and made a short",89132_0.txt
talk along the line of the sentiment they,89132_0.txt
"expressed. The last two paragraphs, however",89132_0.txt
", were not in the original draft, and",89132_0.txt
were submitted as amendments by Judge,89132_0.txt
Billbro and accepted and adopted. It was,89132_0.txt
stated and generally understood that the,89132_0.txt
resolutions as to loyalty to the governor,89132_0.txt
had no reference as to his action in the,89132_0.txt
Johnson case since the bar itself differed,89132_0.txt
"on that point, and more particularly because",89132_0.txt
that was not part of the business,89132_0.txt
"of the meeting, nor did it properly enter",89132_0.txt
"into the proceedings of the meeting, according",89132_0.txt
to expressions of the speakers.,89132_0.txt
Members of Bar Indignant.,89132_0.txt
"Members of the Gadsden bar, especially",89132_0.txt
"those who were heard, were indignant",89132_0.txt
that the county should have been outraged,89132_0.txt
"by the murder of Richardson, and there",89132_0.txt
finally crept in a criticism of officers who,89132_0.txt
surrendered to the mob. Mr. Goodhue was,89132_0.txt
frank and open in the statement that he,89132_0.txt
desired to press an investigation as to,89132_0.txt
"whether the sheriff, police or any officer",89132_0.txt
was remiss in his duty. He said that it,89132_0.txt
should be known what the sheriff did from,89132_0.txt
the time of the assault on the jail up to,89132_0.txt
the next morning at 7 o'clock. It should be,89132_0.txt
"brought out, he said, why the sheriff did",89132_0.txt
"not give the alarm, ring the fire bell or",89132_0.txt
something of the sort. The same applied,89132_0.txt
to policemen who did not give the alarm,89132_0.txt
so that the lynchers might be either prevented,89132_0.txt
from committing the crime or else,89132_0.txt
be detected and identified. Mr. Goodhue,89132_0.txt
said that he wished the sheriff had been,89132_0.txt
"present to note his assertion, that the",89132_0.txt
sheriff and his deputies ought not to speak,89132_0.txt
of the lynching in a light manner and,89132_0.txt
"should feel that they, too, had been outraged",89132_0.txt
.,89132_0.txt
Fed by Agitators.,89132_0.txt
Judge Billbro stated that the mob spirit,89132_0.txt
"existed; that it was fed by agitators, and",89132_0.txt
that everyone who added fuel to the,89132_0.txt
flame was guilty as an accomplice in the,89132_0.txt
lynching of Bunk Richardson. He did not,89132_0.txt
charge or even intimate that an officer,89132_0.txt
"had been derelict in his duty, but he said",89132_0.txt
the law required the sheriff to protect,89132_0.txt
prisoners even up to the point of giving,89132_0.txt
his own life to do so.,89132_0.txt
Boykin Explains Attitude.,89132_0.txt
Mr. Boykin explained and justified his,89132_0.txt
connection with the Johnson se. He,89132_0.txt
said that it had been brought to him,89132_0.txt
that statements had been made that,89132_0.txt
some negro organizations had sent in,89132_0.txt
money and paid him to take the stand,89132_0.txt
he did. This he indignantly denied and,89132_0.txt
explained that he saw Johnson only once,89132_0.txt
and never spoke to him or had any communication,89132_0.txt
with him at any time. The,89132_0.txt
Rev. J. W. Newman' and the Rev. H. C.,89132_0.txt
Kegley were called upon and approved,89132_0.txt
of the sentiment of the meeting as did,89132_0.txt
"Mayor Smith. E. W. Whipps, president",89132_0.txt
"of the Commercial club, was called upon",89132_0.txt
to convene that body at once to take action,89132_0.txt
"on the lynching, and agreed to",89132_0.txt
do so.,89132_0.txt
There can be no question that the people,89132_0.txt
of Gadsden are stirred up over this,89132_0.txt
matter. They are determined to have the,89132_0.txt
outside world understand the true sentiment,89132_0.txt
of the community and it was particularly,89132_0.txt
stated that the unalterable determination,89132_0.txt
of the Gadsden bar to uphold,89132_0.txt
the law should be understood in,89132_0.txt
Etowah county itself. The meeting of the,89132_0.txt
bar association was the initiative movement,89132_0.txt
of the civic and judicial bodies of,89132_0.txt

of the oath they had taken. Particular,89134_1.txt
"stress was laid upon crime, murder",89134_1.txt
in particular. He said that he believed,89134_1.txt
that the failure to bring the perpetrators,89134_1.txt
of lynching to justice was the,89134_1.txt
"cause of so much crime in this county,",89134_1.txt

.,89134_1.txt
to instruct each succeeding grand jury,89134_1.txt
to investigate this lynching until the,89134_1.txt

attention to gambling and asked that,89134_1.txt

on as strict a line as the regular election,89134_1.txt

and jumped out of the building into,89148_0.txt

He was chased down and a rope thrown,89148_0.txt
"around his neck, and he was quickly",89148_0.txt
Lulled up to the county court house.,89148_0.txt
There was an immense crowd the,89148_0.txt

"course to hold up their hands, about",89148_0.txt

"moment, but the men with the rope pulled",89148_0.txt

Early in the evening the mob was kept,89148_0.txt
from the streets leading to the jail by,89148_0.txt
sentries. The guard lines were rushed at,89148_0.txt
9 o'clock and the jail doors were broken,89148_0.txt
in. In making promiscuous fires to smoke,89148_0.txt
out the sheriff and the militia company,89148_0.txt
the jail caught fire. The fire department,89148_0.txt
was turned back with a volley of pistol,89148_0.txt
shots. During the excitement Maples,89148_0.txt

Fully half of the crowd disapproved the,89148_0.txt
"lynching, but nothing could be done to",89148_0.txt
save the negro without endangering the,89148_0.txt
lives of scores of people. In a manner,89148_0.txt
"calmn and deliberate for a mob, the",89148_0.txt
guilty negro was swung up. The crowd,89148_0.txt
was cleared away and several volleys of,89148_0.txt
shots were fired into his body.,89148_0.txt
Additional military companies were ordered,89148_0.txt
"here tonight, but the lack of train",89148_0.txt
equipment prevented them from taking,89148_0.txt
specials and reaching here when needed.,89148_0.txt
The action of United States Judge Shelby,89148_0.txt
may add complications to the lynching,89148_0.txt
and cause an unexpected hand to be taken,89148_0.txt
by the government. He ordered several,89148_0.txt

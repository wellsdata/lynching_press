Negro Lynched in Alabama
SCOTTBORO, Ala., June 30.- A
mob of fifty marched from Larkin-
ville last night and took Andrew
Diggs, colored, from jail and thence
to the woods to be lynched.
Diggs had been arrested for assaulting
Miss Alma Smith, white, at
Larkinville Sunday night and brought
here for safe keeping.
Sheriff Austin resisted the mob with
his life until he was shot down and
the keys taken from him.
The sheriff seized two pistols when
the mob arrived and mounting the
stairs, said he would kill any one who
attempted to come up.
The threat was met with a volley
when the sheriff emptied his revolvers

leg and the other in his right arm.
The daughter of the sheriff ran to
her father and was at once covered
by a pistol in the hands of a member
of the mob and made to deliver the
keys to the cell in which the negro
was locked up.
One of the masked men summoned a
doctor who responded promptly and
dressed the wounds of the sheriff,
which are not dangerous.
When the negro was secured he was
taken to the wods and hanged. The
negro made a confession to the brother
of the young lady and others who
visited the jail after his capture.
A dispatch from Stevenson says
Governor Jenks has been notified of
the lynching and asked to order an investigation
.
Five memebrs of the mob were re
and it is thought they will

Ponchatoula, La., Sept. 23.- Four
negroes were lynched here last night
who were suspected of burglarizing
Heldfelder,
the residence of Henry
whese home is in Tangipahoa parish.
It is said there had been an epidemic
of burglaries in the lower section of
Tangipahoa parish of late. A vigilance
committee was long ago formed for the
purpose of acting when the opportunity
presented itself. The opportunity came
yesterday when Heldfelder reported
that his residence had been entered
the night before and robbed of$ 250 in
cash. As soon as the facts were
known the authorities acted with
promptness, arresting fourteen suspects
during the day. These were con
fined in the small jail. During the day
there was suppressed excitement and
it was evident that some of the negroes
would be severely dealt with. Last
night the doors of the jail were broken
open and the four negroes who had
been selected by the mob as the most
guilty, were taken out and hanged to
the limbs of a large oak tree which
stands near the jail. The people of
Ponchatoula, both white and black, deplore
the action of the mob, and both
in mass meeting appointed a law
races and order committee.

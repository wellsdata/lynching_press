UKIAH, CAL., Oct. 1.- News reached
here to- day of the lynching of Alfred, alias
" Jack," Littlefield of Round Valley, Sun
day evening. Both the lynching and the
murder which led up to it occurred just
across the line in Trinity County.
While J. M. Vinton, a resident of Covelo,
was driving some cattle along the highway.
on Saturday he was suddenly confronted
by Littlefield, who stepped out from be
hind a tree and commenced shooting at
him. Vinton fell and making sure that
his victim was either dead or fatally
wounded Littlefield filed. A young man
in the employ of Vinton immediately notified
the Sheriff of Trinity County, who was
soon on Littlefield's trail, and had over
taken him a short distance from the scene
of the shooting.
A party of ranchers, to the number of
about twenty- five, who heard of the affair at
once took it upon themselves to punish Lit
tlefield for his latest crime as well as for
many others he was suspected of. They
started after the Sheriff and his prisoner.
When they approached Littlefield he
sprang from his horse and made a break
for the brush. Then the reports from a
score of Winchesters rang out and" Jack"
Littlefield's career of outlawry was at an
end.
The lynching party rode up, and after
all preliminaries had been arranged, passed
a rope around the neck of the corpse and
hung it to the limb of a tree, from which
place it was soon after recovered by the
Coroner.
Vinton, the victim of Littlefield, died
last night at the house of Tom Hayden, on
Red Mountain, to which place he had
crawled on his hands and knees after be
ing shot. Vinton was known as a" bad

a ship, on which he was second mate, for
some trouble he had with one of the crew.
He went to Humboldt County, where he
was known as Clark Mellville. When he
came to this county some eight years ago
he resumed his right name. He was in the
employ of George White, the cattle king,
and a partner to some extent in his business
affairs, sharing that position with
John Rohrbough.
Littlefield was a rider in the employ of
Ves Palmer. The mob of lynchers consisted
of about twenty- five men heavily
masked, and over the heads of the horses
they were riding were drawn grain sacks
so as to complete the disguise. It is
claimed that Littlefield was only wounded
by the vigilantes' volley, and that he really
died by strangulation.
The shooting of Vinton and the lynching
of Littlefield is, in the opinion of many,
the signal for an outbreak between the
White and anti- White factions, and it is
hardly possible that trouble can be
averted. Under- sheriff Hendy and several
deputies are now at Round Valley,
ready to quell any disturbance that may
arise.
Littlefield was, at the next term of the
Superior Court, to be tried on the charge
of grand larceny, he having stolen some
cattle. He was also at the same term of
court to be the prosecuting witness in the
case of the people vs. Joseph Gregory, in
which the defendant was charged
having attempted to kill Littlefield. with

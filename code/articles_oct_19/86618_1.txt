Branded" Shame, Disgrace"
Chronicle in an edi
The Marion
torial today said the lynching was
a shame and disgrace and" struck
at the foundation of society."
It continues in part:
" When the sheriff and the police
rasisted the
last Thursday night
mob, they not only were seeking to
defend the young culprits from
death. A greater and more sacred
obligation rested upon them. They
were there to defend the good name
and honor of their city and state
and their nation. Men gladly die
for this cause. It is squarely up to
the officers of the law to enforce the
law against lynching. The lynchers
went into the matter with their eyes
- they must now face the con
open sequence of their act."

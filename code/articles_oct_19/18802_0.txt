" A man named Riley, a miner, was
killed this morning in Winnemucca,
by a faro dealer by the name of Connors
. The man was gambling at a
faro table in Elite saloon and lost
about$ 210, and when he was all in he
asked the dealer to let him have$ 10
On being refused, it is said, he at
tempted to reach for the money on the
table, and as he did so, Connors shot
him through the heart, killing him instantly
. The look- out kicked Connors
in the face and he was otherwise bad
used up by the crowd before the
officers
arrived. and succeeded
ir
landing him behind the bars. The
murdered man was under the influence
of liquor at the time he was killed
Feeling is at a high tension, and it is
not improbable that if the officers of
the law had not arrived in time the
murderer would have been lynched.

LYNCH LAW IN CALIFORNIA.
A correspondent of the Nantucket Inquirer,
at the diggings, says
" To give you an idea of the sway Judge
Lynch has in this country, I will give you a
little description of a case on Rattle Snake Creek
three days ago. A man had stolen$ 600 from
his partners, and was caught with the money
about him. He could not deny the theft, and a
jury was soon empannelled to pass sentence,
which was done as follows: That he should
receive sixty lashes on his bare back, on two
successive days; that his head should be shaved,
his ears cropped, and the letter T be branded on
his forehead, and that notice shall be given him
to quit the mines within forty- eight hours, under
the penalty of death. Rather a severe sentence
, but it was put into execution to the
letter." very

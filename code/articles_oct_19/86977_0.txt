Eloped With a Negro.
INDEPENDENCE, Mo., April 17.- Mrs.
J. A. Houston, the wife of a prominent
farmer, residing near this city, eloped
with the hired hand, a negro by the name
of Dick Black, yesterday. Black had been
employed on the farm by the husband of
the woman with whom he eloped. Mrs.
Houston with her husband and family of
grown- up children, resided on the farm,
which is one of the best in Jackson
county. Several years ago she went off
with a hired man and the guilty pair were
caught in St. Louis by the irate husband,
who afterwards condoned the offense.
This last escapade has caused excitement
to run high in the settlement against the
negro, who, if caught, will be lynched.
Mr. Houston, the husband, will file an
for divorce. All parties concerned
application are highly connected.

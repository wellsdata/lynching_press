Bartlett's Boundary Commission.
This body is happily defunct, the cheif,
Mr. Bartlett, having been at last succeed
by Mr. Campbell, of Texas. Some$ 400,
000 have already been expended in the business
, and still the work is only begun ---
probably all that was peformed under Bart.
lett having to be gone over again.
Bartlett was wholly unfitted for such an
enterprise, and his unfitness was made manifest
as much by the character of a good
portion of the company that he organized
and took with him as by the manner in which
he managed the Survey. It is singular
how he could have gathered together such
a gang as a were.
Five were hung at Socero for lawlessness,
. under sentence of Lynch law, administered
by other members of the commission; one
was murdered at San Antonio by a fellow
. member; one was shot by another member,
between San Antonio and El Paso; one committed
suicide, and two or three were
dered in broils at or near El Paso. mur

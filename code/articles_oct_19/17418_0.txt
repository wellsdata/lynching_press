GREAT EXCITEMENT IN KANSAS!
Governor Robinson in the hands
of the Border Ruflians !!
More Lynch Law and more Hanging !!!
WHETHER the Governor is now to be
hung or not is uncertain, but one thing is certain
that our large stock of WALL PAPERS have not
escaped hanging, but are" pin'd to the wall," and to
meet the demands ofendidrade ritment. Our patterns
another large
are new and beautiful and the prices but a small ad
cance from the manufacturers. Those in want will
call soon while the assortment is good.

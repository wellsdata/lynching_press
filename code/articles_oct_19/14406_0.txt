SHOT COLORED WOMEN!
Shreveport, La., July 21- Joe Pem
berton, Negro, was taken from the
Bossier Parish jail, at Benton, by a
mob early today and hanged to a tree
in Black Bayou swamp, two miles
from Benton, according to reports
reaching here tonight. Pemberton
had been arrested and jailed Tuesday
night following the shooting of
two Negresses.
That a mob of white men lynched
a colored man for shooting two colored
women indicates that they either had
great interest in the women or were
else so blood- thirsty that they gladly
seized the for killing
some one without opportunity risk to themselves.

The Progress of Lynch Law ---
Another Lynching Affair.
We are indebted to Mr. J. D. Brown of
New York Bar, for the first particulars of
a recent case of lynching at Oregon Bar,
,
of on the North Fork of the American River:
On Tuesday last, a fellow named Bill
to Harding was arrested for attempting to steal
a horse from Messrs. Blinn& Moffat. It
in appears that Hardin made an attempt to
an- steal the horse about twelve o'clock the
the night previous, and was caught in the act.
Accordingly, the next morning a Court
was
was organized by the appointment of a jury
ma- of twelve men, and one gentleman as cou
his sel for the prisoner. The evidence was of
the most conclusive character, Hardin hav
the ing been detected in the act. The jury
and found the prisoner guilty, and sentenced him
to receive fifty lashes, have one half his head
shaved, and to be banished from the Bar,
Paul never to return. The sentence was imme
port diately carried out .--[ Sacramento

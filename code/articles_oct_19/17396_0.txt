Abolitionism in our Very Midst -- Startling Events
-Summary Vengeance? Our community was
scited yesterday by the announcement that
greatly
political meeting would be held at the African

only sought a good opportunity in order to strike
them a deadly blow. Great curiosity was manifested
to hear him, and the church was crowded.
Many of our slaves were present. Wise's apeech
was in his usual vehement style. It was profess
edly in defense of the South, and an attack upon
the North, but the design of it could not be over

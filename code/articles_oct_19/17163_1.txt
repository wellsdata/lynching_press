Worthy of Lynch Law.
Hill, the father of the child pretended to
be charmed by snakes, is now in this neighborhood
with his disgusting display. If Lit-
tlefield came near being mobbed in New
York for the exhibition of the wax statuary
of Dr. Parkman and Professor Webster, we
cannot see what will save this Hill from a

that the constant fear of punishment gives
the poor little creature that unearthly aspect
she constatly presents. A father who endeavors
to make profit from the prostitution
of a child's intellect in such a debasing and
revolting manner, deserves no sympathy
from any quarter, no matter what punishment
may be inflicted upon him. The
wretch should not be permitted to pollute
the city with his.- Boston Times.

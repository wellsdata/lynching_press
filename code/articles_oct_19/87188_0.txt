From an Appeal Correspondent.]
LACONIA, DESHA COUNTY, ARK., May 6.- I
venture to send you the particulars of a murder that
occurred at this place on Saturday night last, the
third instant. de Farri, a negro who has restaed
in this neighborhood for several years, was drinking
around town all day, and left for home about nine
o'clock. At eleven o'clock his neighbors heard him
shouting for everybody to come in, as his dear wife
was dead. Before that they had heard shots fired by
him, or at least in his house. hnt so that
was usual
not to
at
they did
a much notice. Upon geing in they
found his wife dead upon the floor, and the brute
lying over her and calling her endearing names. A
warrant was immediately procured for his arrest,
and an inquest was held on the body on Sunday,
the jury bringing in the verdict," That the deceased
came to her death by two pistol shots fired by
Jet Farris." Yesterday( Monday) they buried the
woman, and the prisoner was allowed to attend the
funeral handcuffed. His examination before the
squire was to have come off to- day; but last night,
as he was under guard at Buck's saloon, a party of
masked and disguised men overpowered the guards,
run him off about two hundred yards to a sycamore
tree, where his body was found this morning. An
othar inquest was held- verdict:" That the deceased
came to his death by hanging; said hanging being
done by a party of unknown men." Th nurderer
was considered a very dangerous man, this being his
third or fourth murder; one was shooting Tom
-, out on the Shepard place, in 18-. Every
thing is very quiet here; no excitement at all, con
gidering the circumstances. It is supposed, in fact
known that the colored people did the lynching.
The body of the was buried at the foot of
the tree whereon murderer he was hung. INKPOT.

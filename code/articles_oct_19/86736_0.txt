TENDER MERCIES OF SLAVERY. Five
slaves recently attempted to escape from servitude
at Petersburg, Virginia, in the schooner
Kezian, Captain Wm. Baylis, of Brandy
wine, Delaware. Some of the negroes be
SCO.ing missed a steamer was sent in pursuit of
the vessel, and she was brought back to
Petersburg, the negroes on board and Capt.
Baylis and the Mate Simpkins under arrest
The woman was found concealed in the
midst of a lot of bacon under the cabin flour,
cand the four nien secreted in the cargo of
wheat. When the prisoners were landed the
mob attempted to lynch them, and the threatened
violence was arrested with much dif
icuity. Capt. Baylis was tried in the Circuit
Court on the 10th and was sentenced by
Judge Nash to the Peditentiary for forty
years, for the terrible crime of aiding his
fellow men in escaping from life- long servitude
. Simpkins, the mate, will probably
share the same fate, het oras sa behese
The humane laws of Virginia not only
confiscate the vessel on which staves at
tempt to scape, but subjects the Captain
and mate to fines of$ 500 each, and imprisonment
from three to ten years on each indictment
. Capt. Baylis was sentenced for
eight years each on five indictments. He
is about 45, and Simpkins 35. Both have
families, and belong to Wilmington, Dela-

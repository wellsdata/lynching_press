A special messenger arrived here this
morning from Platte, thirty miles below
here, with special information that Doy and
his son, who were arrested near Topeka
some weeks since, on a charge of running
off negroes were executed by a lynching
,
committee last night. The messenger tells
me that the crowd mustered more than three
hundred strong, and attacked the jail, taking
the prisoners, and then forced the son to
drive the cart out on the ridge about two
miles from the city, where they were hung
to a tree. The old man begged very hard
for his life but they would not hear him.
The son was hung first. There is a great
deal of excitement in Platte in consequence,
and much trouble is feared. The excuse, or
rather the reason why this course was ta
ken, was
cleared by the coult which was to sit there
to- morrow morning. It would be obliged
to clear them, because it was not the proper
district to try hem in, and the citizens had
declared they should not go out of Platte
,
county
,.

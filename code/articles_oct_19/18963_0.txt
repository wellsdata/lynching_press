the mountain tops of Massachusetts does
not cause him to change his mind as to the
treatment he should accord the colored man.
In the U. S. senate when Pitchfork Tillman
was accused of killing the colored men of
the south he replied," Yes, we lynch them
and burn them at the stake, and what are
you going to do about it?" The question of
right to vote should not worry the colored
citizens one half as much as the question
of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
.,
Go to Mississippi Dr. Cannon and instead
of fighting for suffrage with hot air lay in
wait for the next lynching bee and with
your gatlin' gun on your shoulder quietly
make your way to the scene of the human
holacust and at the proper time, pray for a
second to the Almighty God in words like
these:" Dear Lord, I commend my spirit to
Thee. I am about to sacrifice my life in
defense of the black folk, not only here, but
throughout the south and as I am about to
do may others likewise do, when such attacks
as this are practiced on colored citizens. Give
me the sertngth of Sampson and the accuracy
of David and I will sell my life
dearly." And then unannounced get as
near to the center of the scene of the lynch
ing as possible and begin operation. There
is no doubt but that you will die an awful
death, but death is onl ydeath, and if you
succeed in taking with you a score or more
of the lynchers you will put the fear of
God in the hearts of the cowardly whelps
lynching bees will be less frequent there
and after and will cease to be holiday occassions.
And as you will have done in Mississippi
let another do in Georgia, Alabama, Florida,
and wherever the colored man is lynched as
a pastime, and the lynching disease will
gradually abate. No, not by organized ef
fort, but by individual effort. Let some
colored man conclude at every lynching bee
that life is not worth living and that others
may enjoy life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness he going to sell himself dearly
at this lynching is party.

THE LEAVENWORTH HORROR.
The brutal lynching of the negro Fred
Alexander by a mob in Leavenworth is
indefensible. Even though it were ad
Alexander guilty of
mitted that was
the crimes of which he was suspected
still the outrage can not be palliated;
that Alexander asserted his innocence of
the murder in the face of certain death
adds to the horror of the case.
People goaded to frenzy by outrages
upon their homes sometimes commit acts
which their sober second judgment
would condemn and this is undoubtedly
true in this case. The agony of the
negro as he writhed burning at the
stake will not prevent future acts of
violence and at the same time it brutalized
every person connected with the
lynching.
There is one line which marks the difference
between civilized beings and
savages, and that is a respect for the
the
laws. In
rules of society known as
days of most brutal savagery nothing
more filendish ever occurred than the
burning of the negro at Leavenworth.
The spirit that derives joy from human
suffering is a savage one, and has no
place in a civilized community. It was
enough for the rude and
coarse
bad
American Indians of a century ago, but
how much worse it becomes when it
develops among the most enlightened
people of the most enlightened nation on
earth.
It is a mistake to assume that the
death penalty will put a stop to mob violence
. The death penalty is in force in
Ohio and it has not been long since a
scene similar to that enacted in Leaven
worth was enacted in the city of Akrou
which contains about the same population
as Topeka. In this case the vigilance
of the officers prevented the lynch
ing but it was not until several unof
fending citizens had been shot.
The condemnation of the acts of the
mob by the legislature reflects the true
sentiment of the people of Kansas.
There are very few who will justify the
acts of the mob. It is a disgrace to the
state and to the advanced civilization
marks the beginning of the
which Twentieth century.

Murder and Lynch Law in Wisconsin.
There has been for sometime a violent feud ex
sting in Wisconsin between two parties in relation
to a claim of about 40 acres of land. About a
year ago, it resulted in the death of P. S. Furman,
at the hands, it is alleged, of Fred'k. Cartwright,
who had been in jail until a couple of weeks ago,
when he was released on bail, and returned to his
family, in the neighborhood of the disputed land,
known as the" Indian Land." On Saturday night
after his arrival home, about 60 men surrounded
his residence, a log house, and some three or four
of the leaders entered and inquired of the fami
y for Cartwright. His wife replied that she did
not know where he was; npon this they opened
the door leading up stairs and saw Cart
wright standing at the head thereof, armed
with a musket. Cartwright
first spoke, ordering
them to come no further, but not heeding
him they rushed up and Cartwright fired, killing
two of the party- James Langdon, who leaves a
wife and child, and a Mr. Troop, both of middle age;
and then being sensible that further resistance
was useless surrendered himself into the hands of
an officer with the assurance of protection; thence
he was removed to a Justice's office for examination
. He was, however, soon after forcibly taken
from the officers, tied hand and foot, and but a
short distance from the place where he was
ed and suspended by the neck until dead. seiz

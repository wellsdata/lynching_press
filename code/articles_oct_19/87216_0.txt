Miss Martin, victim of the beastly as-
sault made by Dennis Deboer, died at Minonk,
III., on Sunday, Oct. 26. Sunday night a large
erowd of armed men appeared at the jail and
demanded Deboer's person. They soon learned,
however, that he had set fire to the jail build
ing the day before, and that it had been so
badly damaged by fire that he, with other
prisoners was removed to Peoria for safe
,
keeping. This alone saved his life. The funeral
service of Miss Martin was generally
attended and was most impressive and touch
ing.-

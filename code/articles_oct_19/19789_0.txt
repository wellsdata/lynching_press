The Murderer Lynched.
Causes the Death of his Wife
CHICAGO, August 21.- A cold blooded
murder followed by swift and terrible
punishment is reported at Oling, Illinois
on Saturday last. Jefferson White,
a farmer, quarreled
who was at work with a threshing ma-
chine on White's farm. White had
sometime ago killed Kountz's dog and
threatened Kountz's life, and some words
passed in relation thereto, when White
jumped on his horse and rode to his
home and took his shotgun, and, After
shooting off a load of bird shot
that was in it, reloaded it
with buck- shot, and, returning to the
field where Kountz was, rode up to him,
and- placing the gun' so near him
that, when discharged, it burned his
clothing- fired into his body, killing
him instantly. The murderer then rode
into Olney, and after consulting a law-
year, gave himself up to the sheriff, and
was placed in jail. In the meantime,
Kountz's wife, to whom he had been married
less than a year, prostrated by her
affliction, was prematurely confined,
and died' Monday night. On the same
night between two and four
armed men rode up to the jail in hundred Olney,
and, overpowering the guards, burst in
the doors, took White out, and hanged
him to a tree in the court- house yard,
and satisfying themselves that
he was after dead, they rode quietly away.

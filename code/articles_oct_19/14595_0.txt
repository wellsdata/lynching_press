ATTEMPTED OUTRAGE IN ANNE ARUN
DEL- Annapolis, June 14.- While the
coroner's jury was hearing testimony
the lynch-
day to
jail to
county as
at the
-
ing of the negro Sims for an outrage
on Miss Jackson officer Jubb arrived at
the prison with William Thomas, colored
, charged with attempting an out
Stinchcomb,
rage upon Miss Henrietta
a white lady, living in the third district
of this county. It is stated that yester
day about sundown Miss Stinehcomb
was passing through a piece of woods
on her way home from visiting a neighbor
, when Thomas grasped her, but
she escaped and was pursued by him.
Thomas once made a similar attempt
upon a little white girl about fourteen
years old, but was not arrested for it.
The prisoner is about twenty- five years
old. This so soon
after the Odenton outrage and the subsequent
lynching of Sims, has created
a profound sensation here. Sheriff
Carr fears another demonstration by
lynchers, and State's Attorney Revell
has ordered hira to use the whole body
of the county as a possc to prevent
another exhibition of lynch law.-.

The New York Express, with reference to the appal
society
state California
ling of in, remarks:
The progress of Lynch Law in all parts of California
will again arrest the attention of our readers; and
that the executions which take place by authority of
" We the People," under the directions of the Vigilance
Committees, are in order, after due deliberation, by
in will also attention.
The California Journals run over with" murders,"
thefts,"" robberies,"" executions," and other such interesting
items; and the omnipresence of Colt's six bar.
iel revolvers, on almost all trying occasions, is another
singular item in the extraordinary history of this extra-
ordinary State We have not rcom to dwell these
. upon
events; but read and wonder
,.
The execution of one Stewart, in San Francisco, for
an accumulation of crimes, was resisted by" A Law
and Order Party" outside, which, by the way, has the
look to us of sympathizers with the Stewarts, and characters
of his school; and what is more important, by the
Judge of the Court of Sessions, whose charge to the
Grand Jury we give, and also by the Mayor of the
city.
The San Francisco Courier, defending the Vigilance
Committee of that city, says:
" These things, as lovers of Justice, they must do un
til our courts and public authoriti, s shall discharge their
duty and secure the public confidence Before he le-
.
gislators and men in public places began to plunder
before some of our courts, or certain interested lavers
the way the of
ders, there were no MURDERERS THIEVES AND
INCENDIARIES IN CALIFORNIA. We al
to the people of California if this statement be not correct
. The rogues in office are in some measure responsible
before God and the people for all the INNOCENT
BLOOD tha has been shed in this State- for all the
property that has heen sacrificed by burglars and incendiaries
These fellows would never have
menced their criminal career so freely, so boidly, if
they had not found that the course of justice in our judicial
tribunals might be controlled by money, and instead
the courts becoming a terror to all evil doers, became
of THEIR EOLE FRIEND AND PROTECTOR."

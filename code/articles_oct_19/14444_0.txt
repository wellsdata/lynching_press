WICHITA FALLS, TEX., Feb. 26.- The
two men who murdered Cashier Dorsey of
the City National Bank here vesterday and
then looted the bank were captured this
morning. To- night they were taken from
the jail by a mob and lynched to a tele
graph pole.
The robbers, Foster Crawford and the
Kid, alias Younger Lewis, were captured
by posses of rangers under command of
Captain W. J. McDonald in a thicket six
teen miles from Wichita Falls. When
called upon to surrender they replied:
" We will surrender under the condition
that you give us protection against any
mob violence."
Captain McDonald's reply was:" We
will bore a hole through you if you do not
surrender, but I will endeavor to the best
of my ability to protect you."
The outlaws surrendered, and the rangers
reached Wichita Falls with the prisoners
at 4 o'clock this morning. When the town
was reached it was found to be in a state
of uproar, and many threats were made,
the mob crying:" We will lynch them!
Give them a taste of Tyler; that's what
they deserve!" But they finally reached
the jail and landed their prisoners in
safety.
Shortly afterward a crowd of well- armed
men gathered and repaired to the jail,
where they remained discussing the situation
and
swearing vengeance on the
prisoners.
When daylight came the entire population
of Wichita Falls had assembled in the
vicinity of the jail, each man bringing a
Weape. Those who could not boast of a
Winchester had some sort of firearm concealed
on their persons, judging from the
appearance of their pockets.
At 8:30 J. A. Kemp. president of
the looted bank, and at least twenty men
were admitted to the jail. Identification
was instantaneous and undeniable. District
Judge George E. Miller at this juncture
appeared on the streets in a buggy
and drove from group to group pleading
with them to do nothing rash and allow
the law to take its course.
Suddenly the report was heard on all
sides that the rangers were going to slip
the outlaws off to Fort Worth. In the
twinkling of an eye, hundreds of Winchesters
appeared on the scene and the mob at
once made an assault on the jail. After
some moments they succeeded in securing
an entrance, and taking the prisoners from
the jail, proceeded with them to the bank
in which Dorsey was killed, where a pile of
inflammable material was ready to be converted
into a bonfire to light up the scene.
Two telegraph poles were selected and
two ropes thrown over them, in the ends
of which loops had been made, which
were placed around the necks of the men
and the word given to pull In instant
. an
the two men were swinging beneath earth
and sky.
Loud cries of" Riddle them!" was the
signal for the firing to commence. The
bodies were riddled with bullets left
swinging. and

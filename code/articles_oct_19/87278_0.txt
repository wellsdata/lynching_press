A MOB HELD AT BAY.
Frederick Kriselmeyer Saved From
the Vengeance of a Mob in
Brooklyn by Police.
HAD SHOT HIS WIFE AND STEPDAUGHTER
The Latter Thought to Be Fatally
Wounded, But Mrs. Kriselmeyer
Will Probably Recover- The Murderous
Deeds Were Prompted by
Jealousy.
-
New York, July 21.- Only by draw
ing their revolvers and threatening to
shoot to kill did several Brooklyn po
lice prevent a mob from wreaking
vengeance on Frederick Kriselmeyer
after he had shot his wife and his
stepdaughter. Up to the doors of the
Hamburg Avenue police station, the
clamoring mob went crying" lynch
him," and it was necessary to call out
the reserves. Kriselmeyer was SO
badly beaten before the policemen res
cued him that it was necessary to call
an ambulance.
Although he is 60 years old, Krisel
meyer was driven to the shooting by
jealousy of his wife, whom he married
three years ago, and who is 54
years old. She owns the house in
which they lived, and in the station
house he asserted that she had been
receiving the attentions of a wealthy
butcher for some months, and that
saw her and her daughter with
he this man just before the shooting.
In the hospital, suffering from three
bullet wounds, his wife said, in reply
to his assertions, that he was crazy.
The shooting followed a quarrel, durIng
which Kriselmeyer was reminded
that he did not own the house. The
wife probably will recover, but it is
thought the daughter is fatally
wounded.
Returning from the house after the
shooting, Kriselmeyer was surrounded
by neighbors, who beat him down.
He escaped, but was again surround
ed, a policeman finally reached his
side, and revolver in hand, held the
mob back until aid was secured.
The crowd followed, however, until
the had been safely locked
up. prisoner

DISGRACEFUL.- The Oskaloosa Times,
from political motives, we should judge, has
been endeavoring to prejudice the public
mind against Mr. Brown, editor of the Her-
ald, since the unfortunate shooting affair in
which he was concerned, on the 4th of Au-
gust last.
True to its border ruffian and
mob- law instincts, it was not satisfied to
wait for a fair investigation of the case before
deciding upon the guilt of Mr. Brown
and even since his acquittal has been inflain
ing the prejudices of its peculiar class of
readers and by implication if not by direct
council urging the application of lynch law.
In its last issue we observe the proceedings
of what to have been indigna
purports an-
tion meeting of citizens. The resolutions
adopted acquiesce in the lynching of Casteel
and others, and breathe vengeance against
Mr. Brown, if he does not leave the county
The officers of the meeting were Democrat,
and all the speakers who condemned Mr.
Brown were also members of that party.
We suggest to the good citizens of Malaska
that their county is liable to be disgraced it
these resolutions and demonstrations are
suffered to go to the world uncontradicted
and unrebuked. We cannot believe that the
Grand Jury would have discharged Mr.
Brown it he had been guilty of the
made against him. charge

DRIVE OUT BAD ONES.
Evansville, Ind., Jan. 28- The
cities and towns along the Ohio river
have begun a crusade against negroes.
The entire trouble dates back to the
lynchings of the negrues at Rockport
and Booneville for the murder of the
white barber, Simmons, at Rockport,
one night last month. The board of
safety of this city has ordered the
dolice to arrest all strange negroes and
bring them before the city police
judge. If they cannot give any reason
for being here they will be sentenced
to the rock pile
The object of this
order is to rid the town of an
noxious class of negroes. ob

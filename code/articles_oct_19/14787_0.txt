THE WASHINGTON RIOT.- The Stanton Spec Corner
tator, in an able and considerate article on this the
subject has the following paragraph which is Hill
worthy of thought and attention: land
One fact connected with the Washington house
is full of alarm for the future- a majority
riot of the mob is said to have been boys
One fact connected with the Washington
riot is full of alarm for the future- a majority
of the mob is said to have been boys under
eighteen years of age. The mob which hung
the negroes in Louisville a few weeks ago was
partially composed of the same material, and
whenever a riot occurs we have the same ro-
ports. And these are to be the men who in a
short time will have control of the country!-
Where are the fathers, and mothers of the
land that their children thus run wild? Pa-
rental authority must be called into exercise
or there will be little hope for the Republic
, and less for the miserable youths
selves." them

Judge Chisholm, of Kemper county,
Mississippi, was butchered by a mob who
charged that he had instigated the murder
ot one A short time a
named Walter Riley was arrested, tried
and convicted for the murder of Gully.
There is no doubt that he committed the
crime. He confessed as much and within
a week he has suffered the extreme penalty
of the law. The men who had butch
ered Chisholm" labored" with Riley faith
fully, attempting to persuade him to state
that he was moved to the commission of
the crime by Chisholm. Reprieves were
granted him from time to time, and it is
alleged the promise of a commutation of
his sentence was given him conditioned on
his implicating the dead Republican. Riley
protested from the first that Chisholm was
in no way concerned and in that state
ment he persisted to the last, notwithstand
reing that as he waited on the gallows for
the adjustment of the noose the very mob
that mnrdered Chisholm were permitted
to cross question him and endeavor by en
treaty and threat to commit him to some
denunciation of Chisholm that might be
taken as palliation for his public murder.
Riley died declaring that Chisholma had
nothing to do with the killing of Gully
directly or indirectly. The butchers of
Chsholm are therefore without comfort

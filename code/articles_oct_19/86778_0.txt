brother George had been talking about"
him. He went to his brother's house and
told his wife that she must go to Miss
Church's, as that lady was sick .. He asked
for a hammer and she gave it to him.
Wallace and his brother's wife and her little
child started to Church's, and as Mrs.
Wallace was climbing the fence he struck
twice with the hammer on the head, which
killed her. He then picked up the child,
which was crying, and struck it against a
stone. Death immediately followed. He
then went back and told Miss Church to
get him something to eat, and as she star
ted out he struck her several times with

then went home and slept over night, and
gave the alarm next morning in order to
screen himself. He stated that his broth
er and wife had been talking about him,
and his wife and he had determined to
kill the woman His reason for killing
Miss Church is that he was afraid she
would find out what he had done. All this
he confessed after he was arrested on suspicion
and confined in Black's Hotel preparatory
to being committed to jail. He
spent Saturday night praying and crying.
About 2 o'clock in the morning twenty- five
men into the hotel. They approached
the first guard and demanded admittance:
He refused and they drew their pistols and
fired several shots in the air, and the man
ran off. Entering the front door noisily
they began knocking off the lamp chimneys
with their pistol barrels, and as the
wind was blowing strong the lamps were
soon extinguished and the place was in
utter darkness. The mob then began
firing in the ceiling and shouting as if
they were so many devils. They fired
about in such a reckless manner that several
of their party were slightly wounded.
When Wallace heard the uproar he began
sobbing and praying, and as the door of
his room opened and the first of the lynch
ers made his appearance he sprang behinb
one of the guards and screamed," My God
don't kill; save me, save me.!" The mod
laughed at his cries, and after knocking the
guard down and trampling on him, they
threw Wallace on his back and began to
tie his arms. Again he screamed in agony
as great drops of perspiration rolled down
his face:" Don't murder, don't kill me!
For God's sake give me time to pray.

quarter of a mile. He vainly tried to re
and stand but whenever
gain his feet up,
he did so the mob would pull the rope
suddenly and jerk him on his back. After
going nearly a mile below Littleton they
stopped and hung the body to a tree. It
is supposed, of course, that Wallace was
dead by this time. At six o'clock he was
found dangling from a limb of an apple
tree, alongside of the railroad, his feet
about three feet from the ground. When
the early passenger trains on the Balti-
more and Ouio passed the place there was
great commotion among those on board,
and the trains slackened their speed in or

the lynchers' work. When the body was
examined, the spine and neck were found
to be broken, and the body horribly

was at once summoned, and they returned
a verdict to effect that he came to his
death by hanging the at the hands of unknown
persons.
The following letter was found in his
pocket, written to his wife:
" Mrs. Mary Wallace, from a husband

tell the reason I did it, only through the
hatred I had against George for the way
he talked about you when we were stay

you after we went back to your father's.

Henry Villars, more or less, and was drink

away. If I live to get to jail I will write
to you and tell you all I have to say.

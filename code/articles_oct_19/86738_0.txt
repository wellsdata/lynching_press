Five slaves recently attempted to escape
from servitude at Petersburg, Virginia, in
the schooner Keziah, Captain Wm. Baylis,
of Brandywine, Delaware. Some of the
negroes being missed a stranger was sent
in pursuit of the vessel, and she was brought
back to Petersburg, the negroes on board
and Capt. Baylis and the Mate Simpkins
under arrest. The woman was found concealed
in the midst of a lot of bacon under
the cabin floor, and the four men secreted
in the cargo of wheat. When the prison
ers were landed the mob attempted to lynch
them, and the threatened violence was ar
rested with much difficulty. Capt. Baylis
was tried in the Circuit Court on the 10th
and was sentenced by Judge Nash to the
Penitentiary for forty years, for the terrible
crime of aiding his fellow- men in escaping
from life- long servitude. Simpkins, the
mate, will probably share the same fate.
The humane laws of Virginia not only
confiscate the vessel on which slaves at
tempt to escape, but subjects the Captain
and mate to fines of$ 500 each and impri√©
from three to ten years on each indictment
. Capt. Baylis was sentenced for
eight years each on five indictments. He
is about 45, and Simpkins 35. Both have
families, and belong to Wilmington,

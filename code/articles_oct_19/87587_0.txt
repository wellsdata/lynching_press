A GREAT VILLIAN. The man John B. Har
din lately hung by lynch law, in Milton, Fla
with a negro, for murder, confessed the crime
and said he richly deserved death, for he had
been a villian all his life. He had twenty
wives living, and had killed sixteen men. and
regreted that he was not permitted to live long
enough to kill four more. Repentence and
remorse were strangers to him. He said his
father and brother were both
ote bags hung.d

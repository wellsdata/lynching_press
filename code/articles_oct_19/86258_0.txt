SPEAKER CLARK
SHARES HONORS
Says Wife of Sheriff Really Prevented
Missouri Mob From Hanging
Negro Murderer.
BOWLING GREEN, Mo., Oct. 8. ----
Speaker Champ Clark, who prevented
the lynching of a negro by a mob,
declines to bear the honors alone,
and declares that the wife of the sher
iff in whose charge the prisoner was
confined, is entitled to the honor of
having saved the state of Missouri
from bearing the stain of another
lynching.
Speaker Clark states that the wife
of the sheriff parleyed with the lead
ers of the mob until he could summon
help and lead the rescuers against
the mob. The mob threatened to give
battle to the rescuers but were persuaded
by his eloquence to let the
negro, who is accused of murder se
cure a fair trial.,

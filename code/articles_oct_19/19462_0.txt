. MARCHING ON HUNTSVILLE.
Serious Trouble Apprehended From
a Moh of Lynchers.
Montgomery, Ala., June 11.- Gov. Johns
ton received a telegram tonight from the
sheriff of Madison county, saying that
he has information that a mob from
Decatur was marching to Huntsville to
lynch the negroes under arrest there for
assaulting a child.
The sheriff wired that he had arranged
with the circuit judge to hold a special
term of court next week to try the negro,
and this action had appeared to appease
the mob to such an extent that he had relieved
the Birmingham troops froin duty.
Before they could leave the city, however,
the report that large re- enforcements were
en route from Decatur reached the sheriff's
ear and he ordered the Birmingham companies
on duty again.
Governor Johnston wired the sheriff to
protect the prisoners at all hazards. The
dispatch from Huntsville says the situation
there at 10 o'clock- tonight is still
ominous.
If the mob the jail a bloody
fight is bound attacks to ensue.

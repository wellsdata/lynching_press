NEW ORLEANS, La., May 6.- The States
Bays:" The report of the grand jury brings
to light a number of startling facts, all more
or less directly concerning the assassination
of the late superintendent of police of this
city, the miscarriage of justice in the prosecution
of the murderers and the subsequent
lynching of the latter in the parish prison.
Naturally the grand jury could indict no one,
or no number of those concerned in this business

The Times- Democrat says:" The grand
jury has given the proper return in the par.
ish prison lynching, a return that will meet
with the approval of the entire people, not of
New Orleans alone, but of the country. The

not guilty, a finding of" well done," had long
since been returned as to the men whose acts
suppressed the Mafia and gave a warning to
the criminals of Europe that they would
no welcome in this country." find

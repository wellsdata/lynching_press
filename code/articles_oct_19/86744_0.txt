A Another account states, that one of the
counterfeiters was arrested by the people of
Bellevue, and that the man on board of the
Flora was under the charge of an officer, to
put him in jail in some place where he would
be safe from the excited populace of Bellevue.
Just about seventeen years ago last Saturday
, if we remember rightly, the" Great
Lynching" took place at Bellevue, when ten
fifteen persons were killed. We are sorry
or to hear new violence.

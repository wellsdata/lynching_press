NEBRASKA MOB LYNCHES A MAN.
Hangs Laborer Who Killed Farmer
and Wife Last Spring.
Omaha, Neb
. Loris Higgins
,
who murdered W. L. Copple. a
farmer, and his wife, near Rosalie,
Neb., May 12, was lynched at Boneroft
Monday. Sheriff Young of Thurston
county came to Omaha Sunday night
to get his prisoner, who had been in
the Douglas county jail here since his
capture, and took him to Bancroft on
a train which arrived there about
eight o'clock in the morning. Twenty
men took Higgins from the sheriff
hauled him off in a dray and hung him
to a tree.
When the sheriff left for Omaha
Sunday he was accosted by citizens at
Bancroft, who asked him what he
would do if they should attempt to
Iyach Higgins.
" Shoot the first man who tries it,"
he said.
" Well, we just wanted to know.
Chances are you will have some shoot-
ing to do."
Higgins' crime was a wanton one.
He had worked on the Copple farm
and had some trivial dispute with, Mr.
Copple. Anger over this is the only
suggestion of a reason for the murder
of the farmer and his wife. He killed
both in the barnyard with a gun. He
was a young man, and after his arrest
became radically religious participating
in every service held at the jail.-

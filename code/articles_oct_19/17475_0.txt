IS DISGUSTED
WITH LYNCHERS
Objects to the Manner in
Which They Used
Their Pistols.
Baltimore, March 31.- Sheriff Andrew
Kinhart of Harford county, who under
wont such a disagreeable experience Mon
day night when the negro Harris was tak
en froin the jail at Belair and lynched,
was at the County Clerk's office, Towson,
yesterday, attending to some business.
He is very much put out at the action of
the inob which did the hanging. He said
he would not have felt so indignant had
the mob confined its assault to the jai
building, but he considered it a crimol,
for its members to fire 17 shots into his
private residence. All of the shots except
two went through the transom over the
door. One went through the door and
one went through the window of the room
occupied by his daughter, passing just over
her head. The Shoriff had with him the
ball that came near killing his daughter,
Sheriff Kinhart said that a jail could eas
ily be built to keep prisoners in, but it
was a very hard thing to erect a building
that would keep a mub out. It would be
an easy thing now for a mob to get in the
jail, he says, and thore is no outside door
to the building, the onelbattered in by the
mob not having yot been replaced. Ho
said he did not know what the negro Har.
ris said after the mob got hold of him, and
he asserted he would not believe any one
in the mob on oath. He said the negro
Black, in Baltimoro jail, accused of assaulting
Miss Jessie Bradfore near Aber
deen, would be allowed to remain in the
Baltimore jail and would not be to
Belair for trial. taken

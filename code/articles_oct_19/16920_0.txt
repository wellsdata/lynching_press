GAGLIANO IS BOUND
OVER WITHOUT BAIL
Italian Is Held for Sensational
Lynching of
at Bessemer Negro
Louis Gagliano, who was charged with
killing John Chandler, a negro, on the
streets of Bessemer two weeks ago, was
bound over without bail to await the ac
tion of the grand jury by Judge I. H.
Benners of the court of common pleas
yesterday morning.
The killing occurred while the negro
was in custody of the officers of the law.
who were taking him to the county jail
in Birmingham. Chandler had been held
by the coroner on a charge of having
killed Charles Gagliano, an Italian mer
chant of Bessemer, who was foully murdered
at his place of business on the Fri
day preceding the tragedy at Bessemer.
While the deputies and the prisoner
were waiting for the car to convey them
to Birmingham, the funeral procession of
the murdered man, which was attended
by a large number of his countrymen,
passed along the street where the officers
and their charge stood waiting.
As the funeral procession passed some
of the attendants recognized the prisoner,
and breaking ranks a perfect fusilade of
shots was fired at the negro who feil
,
dead in his tracks. The deputy in charge,
who himself was shot in the leg, held
Louis Gagliano and charged him with
having fired the shots that killed Chandler
. The affair created intense excitement
in Bessemer as it happened on a Sunday
afternoon in broad daylight. There have
been six other arrests made charging implication
in the affair. These cases were
transferred to the Bessemer courts, where
the accused will be given a hearing this
week.
It is stated that habeas corpus proceed
ings will be instituted this week by Ross
& Goodwyn, attorneys for the defendant,
seeking to secure his release on bond.

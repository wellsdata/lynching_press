BY WHAT RIGHT?
The newspapers report the recent
lynching of a negro soldier in Georgia
because he refused to remove his uniform
that his murders thought he had
worn too long. There is a federal
statute that protects the uniform and
its wearer from abuse. Regardless of
the fact that the colored divisions
performed some of the most heroic
fighting of the war, and their numbers
are entitled to some consideration
on that account, why should not
the war department be governed by
the law and take steps to avenge the
of this man?

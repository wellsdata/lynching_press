SHERIFF SHIPP FILES
HIS ANSWER.
His Attorney Takes Position That
Johnson Case Was Not Appealable
To the Supreme Court.
Washington, Oct. 17. SUpreme
court of the United States to
day, the Hon. Judson Harmon filed
the answer of Sheriff Shipp of ilam
ilton county, Tennessee, and nine
deputies to the charge of contempt
laid by the supreme court in connection
with the lyncing in Chattanooga
last March of a negro named Ed
Johnson after the court had granted
an appeal in his case. He takes the
position that Johnson's case was poti
appealable, and that therefore the su-
court was without jurisdiction.
but that if the court had jurisdiction,
Shipp and his subordinates were not
guilty, as they exercised due diligence
to pervent the lynching. Shipp was
in the court room, but none of his
deputies were present.
The seventeen other defendants in
the case charged with participation
in the lynching, also filed their answers
through attorneys, denying the
act charged and asking to be dis
charged from custody. One of the
alleged lynchers was present in per
son.
The court took the matter under ad-
visement.
Among those in attendance is Judge
McReynolds, of the criminal court of
Hamilton county, where Johnson, the
negro, who was lynched, was tried
and convicted.
Judge McReynolds said that the im-
ression that the people of Chattan
nooga condemned Sheriff Shipp andrie
were doubtful as to Johnson's guilt,
was wrong, and, on the contrary, the
stood
voters of Hamilton county
considered the
sheriff. He
with the
e- election of Sheriff Shipp by a ma
ority of fifteen hundred as conclusive
evidence of how he stood in the com-
munity.
Judge McReynolds said that when
he heard of threats against Johnson
he telephoned the sheriff to go to
the jail, and he was there in ten min-
ntes afterward, but was seized and
held as soon as he arrived. The fact
that Johnson had been in the jail for
a week without any demonstration
against him was evidence to Judge
McReynolds that the sheriff anticipated
no trouble and had no reason to
do so.
The judge also emphatically denied
that the mob jeered at the name of
Justice Harlan, of the supreme court,
nor was there any notice pinned on
Johnson's back addressed to Justice
Harlan. Judge McReynolds is a
friend of Shipp, and will assist
him warm to the extent of his ability.

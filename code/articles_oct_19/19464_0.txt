Hempstead, Tex., Oct. 21.- After be
ing tried with legal form and procedure
for criminal assault and murder,
and given the death penalty in each
case, Jim Wesley and Reddick Barton,
negroes, were late this afternoon taken
from the authorities and lynched in
the public square by an infuriated mob.
The district judge asked the Govern
or for troops to accompany the negroes
here from jail at Houston, where they
were safe. At the request of a large
number of citizens of Hempstead who
signed a written promise to aid the authorities
in preventing any mob law,
it is said Judge Thompson countermanded
his request and the troops
not accompany the negroes. did
Barton was first tried. He pleaded
guilty to criminal assault and then to
the murder of Mrs. Susan Lewis, aged
63, Sunday, Oct. 12. The juries in each
case, on which were several negroes,
promptly returned verdicts assessing
the death penalty.
Broke in the Court Room,
During the afternoon Wesley was put
on trial. He pleaded guilty to assault
and then to the murder charge, but
while the second trial was going on a
Imob broke into the courtroom and at
tempted to take him, having learned
that the sheriff had finally asked for
troops.
The mob was dispersed and the trial
proceeded, the state putting through
its testimony hurriedly and in corroboration
of the plea of guilty. Both
juries assessed the death penalty.
The officers of the court sat about the
room awaiting the coming of the
troops, when there was a sudden move
ment on the part of several men in the
room, the sheriff was overpowered and
Wesley was taken of by the
mob and hurried away possession.
Hanged in Public Square.
Another portion of the mob attack
ed the jail and Barton was surrender
ed to them without a struggle. The
two prisoners were hustled to the public
square and there executed by
hanging.
Neither of them had been sentenced
and District Judge Thompson had positively
refused to permit them to waive
the thirty days of grace allowed them
by law. It was the general desire that
they die quickly.
They are hanging to- night to the
arm of a telephone pole, where only
last month a negro murderer had been
strung up by a mob.
The town is quiet to- night. Sheriff
Lipscomb was badly hurt about the
back by the rough treatment of the
mob. During the first rush a shot was
accidentally fired and Sheriff Sparks
of Lee county, was wounded in the
stomach, though not seriously hurt.
The governor was informed of the
lynching, but has yet had nothing
say. to

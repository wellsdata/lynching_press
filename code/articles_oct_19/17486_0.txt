BAKERSVILLE, N. C., Jan. 4.- Twenty
two men were killed in a battle between
officers and a mob that attacked the jail
here last night for the purpose of lynch
ing Calvin Snipes, who had murdered
Isaac Osborne last August.
The battle was one of the bloodiest in
the south since the war, armed and deter
mined men facing each other, one party
to uphold the law and the other to take
the dispensation, of justice into its own
hands. For two days the mob has been
gathering and the authorities had timely
warning of its purpose, and prepared to
resist. The leaders of the mob were
known and made little effort to conceal
their identity. All of Monday night
squads of 20 and 30 hung round the little
back woods prison to prevent the murderer
from being spirited away. On Tuesday
the sheriff warned the mob to disperse,
promising that justice should be fully
satisfied when the trial came on. He declared
that the prisoner would be protected
until that time with all the power of
oid North State. the

WIGGINS, Miss., June 22 .-( AP)
A 25- year- old negro identified by
officers as R. D. McGee, accused of
attempting to attack the 11- year
old daughter of a white farmer,
was lynched Saturday two miles
east of Wiggins by a mob of white
men estimated at between 200 and
400 men.
Seized From Bed
The alleged attack upon the
White girl occurred Friday after
noon and a posse of citizens which
formed into an infuriated mob in
Stone county seized the negro from
his bed Friday night at his home
near Wiggins and carried him into
the woods.
There McGee was hidden away
from the officers and it was declared
that he was identified by
the white girl and also by a negro
girl who said she had seen him
" hanging around."
One eye witness quoted the negro
as admitting that he had beaten
the white girl and as saying that
he did not know why he did it ex
cept that" I must have been crazy."
The child was reported attacked
while picking blackberries in a
pasture near her home. She bore
bruises on her face and neck.
Hanged From Tree
The mob hanged the negro from
a woodland tree Saturday morning
between 8 and 9 o'clock and
riddled his body with bullets. They
left the body hanging and dis-
persed.
Sheriff J. A. Simpson, of Stone
county, said Saturday that the mob
had successfully hidden the hunt
ed man from him and his officers
during the night and that he had
not had McGee in his custody.
The scene of the lynching was
in one of the remote rural sections
south Mississippi. No ar
rests had of been made at last reports.

A PARALLEL CASE
Farmhand Near Elgin Was Lynched
Eighteen Years Ago
The Pender tragedy culminating. in
the Higgins lynching at Bancroft has
a striking parallel in north Nebraska
history of eighteen years ago. Last
July this parallel murder of the eighties
was pointed out in The News but
at that time Pender people scouted the
idea that their own double tragedy
would end in the punishment of the
murderer still further call to mind the
shooting of the Clarks near Elgin and
the lynching of Nicolas Foley.
It was on June 19, 1889, that Mr. and
Mrs. Pomeroy Clark of Elgin were
shot in their bed room. Nicholas Fo
ley, who shot the Clarks, was like Higgins
employed as a farmhand by the
husband and wife who were his victims
.
Angered because the Clarks objected
to his attentions to Mrs. Clark's sister,
young Foley stole into Clark's room
and shot the husband. He rushed
down stairs only to return later in the
night with a ladder. Climbing the lad-
der he shot and instantly killed Mrs.
Clark.
Foley was captured near Burwell
after a chase that again paralleled
Higgins' flight across the country
When Deputy Sheriff Beckwith with
his prisoner were four miles east of
Elgin on their way to Neligh they were
overpowered by a mob.
Foley was
taken from the officer and lynched.
He was hanged from a high
over Cedar Creek. bridge

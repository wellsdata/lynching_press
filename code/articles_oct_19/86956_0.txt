unable make
the
hid. This led to the killing. Mrs. Drake
attempted to shoot Grandstaff and he
killed her in the presence of two children.

their throats.
At a late hour to- night 1,000 determined
men surrounded the jail but the
authorities refused to give up the prison-

down and the officers were overpowered.
An hour was spent in breaking down the
steel cage and then the
with desperate fury against the mob that
sought to enter. The struggle did not
last long and he was taken out, bound
hand and foot, led to the porch below and
there preparations were made to hang
him. A rope was placed around his neck
and the prisoner asked what he had to
say.
He protested his innocence, but it was
known that he had made a full confession

The scene at the jail was horrible. The
prisoner was covered with blood, having
been terribly mangled while the steel cage
was being battered down.
At 12:45 a. m. the mob hung the prisoner
to a tree in front of the court house,
and let him down to see if he would con

confession to the lynchers and after some
time they strung up again. When

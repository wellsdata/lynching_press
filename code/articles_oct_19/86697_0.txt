Marianna.- Deputy Sheriff Mark
Yarbrough was shot and killed by
two negroes, Arthus Jones and John
Collins, in front of his home, a half-
mile northwest of Marianna. The negroes
were arrested by Sheriff M. H.
Ford and are said to have confessed.
Collins was arrested soon after the
shooting and Jones was brought in
later. After the arrival
of each
crowds
gathered and threats
of
lynching were made and only the
firm attitude of Sheriff Ford and his
announcement that he intended
to
protect his prisoners at all hazards
prevented the crowd from wreaking
summary vengeance on the two negroes
.
It is said that the negroes had been
in Marianna and had been drinking
heavily. As they came opposite Dep.
uty Yarbrough's house on their way
home they are said to have been cursing
and making a disturbance. The
officer secured his shotgun and, go
ing to the road, told the negroes that
unless they ceased making a disturbance
he would arrest them. It is said
that the
negroes, without saying a
word, opened fire on the deputy with
automatic pistols, firing 12 shots at
him. He was shot twice through the
arm and once through the body. He
was taken into the house and died
in a short time.
Sheriff Ford was notified and at
once started a search for the assassins
. He found the negro Jones, who
was wounded, Deputy Yarbrough hav.
ing shot him after the negroes opened
fire on him.
Jones declared that he
had been robbed and shot by a man
unknown to him while returning
home. After being lodged in jail,
however, Jones is said to have
cated Collins. impli

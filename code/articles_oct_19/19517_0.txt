Georgia proposes to make lynching
odious; accordingly a jury has convicted
a negro of complicity in the
lynching of another negro and sentenced
him to ten years in the peni-
tentiary. It is not related that any
steps have been taken to convict the
participants in other lynchings, but
perhaps we ought to be content
a beginning has been made. that

of the opinion that there is a great deal of cow-
ardice in the Perry's -- ask the British soldier
if he has any particular reason for supposing
the Gansevoorts a very run- away race.
Let any English officer, whose tastes run that
way, try the mettle of McKenzie with an equal
or superior number of men and guns. As to
Lynch Law," it were as well for British soldiers
and British sailors to but little about
say
it. It was Lynchlaw at the Nore, we suppose
Lynch Law when Lord Camelford shot his
majesty's Lieutenant dead, for refusing to obey
his order of questionable legality. We have
thein Lynch law ourselves at different
given times. Hull dispensed a little of that code
upon the Guerrier on a certain occasion. Bain-
bridge lynched the Java most abominably, and
Biddle and Jones and several others have been
guilty of very irregular proceedings" towards
British subjects, we acknowledge, and we
do not wonder at any little complaisance like
that of the British journalists. As to the hon-
or of the American Navy in connexion with
the Somers, Stewart Jones and Dallas have
passed upon it, and that answers our purpose,
without any particular reference to the opinion
of United Service Journal."

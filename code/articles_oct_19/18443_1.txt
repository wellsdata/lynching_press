WORDS OF COMMENDATION,
Goldsboro, N. C., August 27.
( Correspondence of The Messenger.)
Members of the jury of inquest, who
heard the evidence over the remains
of the negro Tom Jones, who had been
lynched for an assault upon a white
lady, are receiving personal letters
from
strangers through the country
commending them for approving the
action of the citizens in lynching the
negro. The verdict of that jury is the
most novel and unique ever
and is approved by everybody recorded so far.

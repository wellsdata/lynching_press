Near Rendeville, Ohio, Saturday night, Peter
Clifford was called to his door by two men and
shot. He fell dying into his wife's arms, say-
ing the," The Hickeys have killed me." The
Hickeys, four in number, and Joe Reddy, their
brother- in- law, were arrested. Sunday night
Richard Hickey and Reddy were taken from
jail by a mob and Hickey was hanged. Reddy
,
was up, but the rope broke, and he was
spared strung for trial.

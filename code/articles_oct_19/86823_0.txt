Firmly Courageous Action.
( Philadelphia, Pa., Press)
The South in general and Kentucky
in particular should be grateful for
Governor Morrow's firmly courageous
action. In using the militia to disperse
an armed mob bent on lynching
a Negro prisoner he has struck a blow
at lynch law which will long be remembered
and which should have
salutary effect in effacing it altogether
. The South needs more executives
his stamp of conscientious-
ness and of fearlessness.

THE Osage City( Kansas) Savings
Bank suspended on the 28th, owing to complications
with the Danford Caldwell and
Hunnewell banks, which closed their doors
a few days previous. Danford, owner of
the latter institutions, and Smith, his cashier
, were arrested and taken to Wellington,
upon charges of receiving deposits after they
knew their banks to be insolvent. Some
hours later a party of men from Caldwell
took the two bankers by force from the officers
with the avowed intention of taking
them back to Caldwell and compelling them
disgorge. There was some apprehension
to that they might be lynched.

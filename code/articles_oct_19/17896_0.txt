Thos. Pebley returned last night
from Mobile where he went Thursday
on legal business .. Mr. Pebley was
in Mobile yesterday at the time the
two negroes were lynched just north
of the city and he says the excite
nient was quite general for a time, al
though the colored population itself
did not seem to share much of it. Mr.
Pebley says that, outside of consider
able metal roofling which is still in
streets, Mobile does not show
the much sign of the recent storm.

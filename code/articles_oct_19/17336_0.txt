Finally, as if to crown the triumphs of the year.
Americans have actually sailed through the isthmus
connecting the two continents of the New World, and,
while Englishmen have been doubting and grudging
, Yankees have stepped in and won the day. So
we think. on the whole, that we may afford to shake
hands and exchange congratulations, after which
we must learn as much from each other as we can.
As for yachts, we have no doubt that by next August
every vessel of the Cowes squadron will be trimmed
to the very image of the America: there is no doubt
that our farmers will reap by machinery, and the revolver
, we fear, is too attractive an embodiment of
personal power to be overlooked by European mis
chief- makers. We trust. however, that we may borrow
the lines of the America, and even the use of
Mr. Colt's patent without being seduced into institutions
" of Lynch, law and homicide.

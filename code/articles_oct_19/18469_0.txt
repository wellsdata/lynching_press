Mob Law in Virginia.
The governor of Virgania yesterday
made a feeble attempt to save his
state from the disgrace of a resort to
mob law by preventing the lynching
of a negro who was charged with the
murder of two white men. But his excellency
seems to have lacked the necessary
backbone to carry out his good
intention, for he allowed the troops to
be withdrawn in the face of warning
as to what was certain to follow. As
a result the negro was speedily taken
from jail, hung to a tree and his body
riddled with bullets by an infuriated
mab of" good citizens." Then, to add
to the horrors of the affair a mob of
colored citizens assembled and lynch-
with the
ed a white man who was
negro when the murders were committed
. There seems to be no doubt
that the vicitms of these mobs were
guilty and deserved their fate, but
that does not excuse the mobs nor remove
the disgrace from the state.
These lynchings are object lessons in
crime, and they have the effect of destroying
popular respect for law,
which will some day bear fruit in
ways little expected by those who are
for them.- Columbus Dis-

SPICER WILL APPEAL
TO SUPREME COURTA
FOR ANOTHER TRIAL
Covington Planter Was
Given Life Term for Mur
der of Wife to Collect
Insurance
Montgomery, January 17 .-( Special)
Sam Spicer, the Covington county farmer,
will appeal to the supreme court next
week to give him another chance to prove
that he did not kill his wife and place the
crime on a negro whom he had employed.
Spicer was convicted and given a life sentence
, but appealed and has been in the
Montgomery county jail pending disposition
of his case in the high court.
At the same time Spicer's case is submitted
the state will ask the supreme
court to reverse the Covington county
criminal court in its ruling that Spicer
should be allowed bail.
Soon after Spicer was arrested he entered
habeas corpus proceedings and the
lower court ordered him released on bond.
The state appealed and this prevented
Spicer's release, until the original case
had been tried.
To make sure that there could be no
hitch by which Spicer could obtain his
liberty in the event the supreme court
reversed the original case and remanded
it back to the lower court for trial, the
state appealed from the court's ruling
in the habeas corpus case.
Spicer was charged with killing his wife,
so he could collect insurance on her life.
He claimed a negro named Green murdered
Mrs. Spicer and a mob lynched the
negro later. One of the allegations of
the state was that Spicer was a member
of the mob and fired the shot which took
the negro's life.
Cases from the fourth division, composed
of the counties of Barbour, Bullock,
Coffee, Covington, Crenshaw, Dale, Geneva
, Henry, Houston and Pike, will be
by the supreme court next
considered week.

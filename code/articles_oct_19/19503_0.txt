NEGRO ESCAPES LYNCHING
Pennsylvania Officers Take No
in Case. Risks
POST HEAVY GUARD ABOUT JAIL
He Had Committed Murder While
Resisting Arrest and Iron
Workers Were Much
Excited.
EASTON, Pa .. Aug. 27.- There was much
excitement about the county jail at 3
o'clock this morning due to a rumor from
South Bethlehem that a party of deter
mined iron workers had left that borough
in an automobile to come to the county
seat and take Wm. Handy, a South Caro-
lina negro, from jail and lynch him. The
negro was arrested several hours earller
for the murder at South Bethlehem last
night of Policeman Shuman. Warden Collins
took no chances, and aroused and
armed all the deputies and trusties, put
the double bars on all the entrances to the
prison and had the entire police force stationed
around the jail. The prisoner was
taken from his cell and hidden in a remote
corner of the prison. After waiting until
dawn for the arrival of the supposed lynch
ers the officers were dismissed. Policeman
Shuman had heard of a negro insulting
women in a lonely section of South Beth
lehem and went to that quarter to make
an investigation. He found Handy and
when he attempted to place him under ar
rest the negro opened fire. Two bullets
entered the policeman's bodyl and he died
a block from the place where he was
shot. Policeman McCue found Handy in a
board yard and jumped upon him before
he could get his revolver, which had
been reloaded, into action. A crowd of
men surrounded the prisoner and he
was badly beaten. He was rushed to jail
in an automobile. Today Handy pretends
to be ignorant of the happenings of
night. last

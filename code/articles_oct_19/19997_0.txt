Robert Berrier, a young white man who
last week murdered his mother- in- law at
Lexington, N. C., was taken from jail there
by a masked mob and lynched. He was taken
to an oak tree at the outskirts of the town to
a limb of which a rope was adjusted, Berrier
placed on a horse and the rope tied about his
neck. After making a request that his child
should be looked after, the horse was snatch
from under him and his body left hanging
ed between heaven and earth.

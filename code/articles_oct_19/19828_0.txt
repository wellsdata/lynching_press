It is the duty of the grand jury of
Habersham county, and the solicitor
general of that circuit, to go to work and
find out who were the ringleaders in the
lynching of Policeman Carter's murderers.
There were 200 men in the mob, it is re
ported, and some one in that crowd will be
sure to" leak" information enough to base
an inquiry upon. Let the investigation be
begun at once and pushed to its lawful
conclusion. Lynchings are growing too
common The practice must be stopped,
and at once..

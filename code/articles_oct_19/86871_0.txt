LYNCHING.
Reference was made in these columns
a few days ago to the encouraging
decrease in the number of
lynchings, as shown by the statist: es
for 1907. The decrease is in itself
cause for congratulation. But a
a
more careful examinat on of the tabulated
statement reveals some facts
that should bring us to serious
thought. It appears that the crime
usually associated with lynching in
the public mind had comparatively
small place among the causes of this
type of lawlessness in the last year.
If the statement from which we get
information be correct, many lynch
ings were not the result of rape;
some were for such comparatively
trivial things as non- payment of
debt and fighting. And at least two
persons, one of whom was a woman,
were lynched for no other reason
than that they were related to the
real criminal.
There is terrible significance in
such facts. The logical and necessary
result of defiance of law is appearing
; the wrath of the mob that
was once believed to be the avenger
is becom
of the wrongs of women,
ing a wild and senseless menace to
all constituted authority. Such result
was ana is inevitable. The law
has, in the final analysis, but one
guarantee of authority; it lies in a
certain attitude of respect and obedience
in the mind of the individual
citizen. Destroy this attitude at
any point in any man, and all law
in some degree, loses is regnancy
over him. Arouse him sufficiently
and he will disregard law. A mob
of such men knows no law or justice
save the law of brute force and the
justice of senseless wrath. Before
reach'ng a criminal to wreak its
vengeance upon him, the mob must
trample upon the authority of the
state. The law is the most outraged
victim.
It is useless to repeat here the
opinions so often given as to methods
of preventing such dangerous
and humiliating occurrences. But
it might be worth while to call attention
to the fact that the casual
expressions of opinion by men who
have not been and would not be in
such mobs, have much to do with these
things. One frequently hears good
law- abiding men excuse lynching on
the ground that it is the result of
the Southerners' determination to
avenge the wrong of their women.

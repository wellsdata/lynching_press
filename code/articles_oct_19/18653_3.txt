Hunt for Leaders.
At police headquarters it was
stated that they had not yet arrested
any of the leaders of the riot,
but were making every effort to
apprehend them.
The county's court house build-
ing, one of the finest structures in
the city, was badly damaged both
by the fire and by attacks upon it
by the mob. Practically every win
dow in the place was smashed by
bullets or stones during the attacks
by the rioters before the
lynching of the negro occurred.
Pistols and other firearms were
used freely during the fight by
ficers and rioters. 01-

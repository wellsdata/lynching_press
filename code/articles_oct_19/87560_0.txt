[ From the San Francisco Herald, June 11.]
We give, elsewhere, a report of the lynching of Jenkins
, by the citizens, at 2 o'clock this morning. We
have barely space to say that he was tried by a jury of
the highest respectability, and was unquestionably guilty
of the crime for which he was condemned. The ex
ample was terrible; but if it have the effect of riding
us of the thieves who iniest our city, and of the incendiaries
and assassins by whom the lives of our citizens
are nightly threatened, we shall not regard the punish
ment as too severe. There is reason to believe that
the unfortunate man was of the most character
. hardened

COURT POSTPONES
TRIAL OF LYNCHERS
Sheffield, Ala., Feb. 10.- The special
term of circuit court for Colbert
county convened at the sourt house
in Tuscumbia this morning at 9
o'clock, Judge J. J. Curtis, presiding.
A great crowd of people were in attendance
, expecting to hear the trial
of Frank Dillard and Jeff Jenkins,
who had been indicted in connection
with the lynching of the Negroes in
Sheffield several weeks ago. At 11:30
the cases had not been called on account
of the absence of Attorney
General Tate. Counsel A. H.
Car-
michael made a plea in the interest of
the defendants, in which he stated he
thought the defendants were entitled
to bond or a trial. In the absence
of the attorney general Curtis
adjourned the court for Judge two weeks.

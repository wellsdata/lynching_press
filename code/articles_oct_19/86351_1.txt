YOUNG NEGROES
WERE DESPERATE
Kill Sheriff and Two Deputies
Before Being Captured and
Lynched by Mob.
Harrisburg, Miss., Sept. 29 .-
Walter and William Jones, mu
lato brothers, while drink- crazed,
began shooting up the town and
when Sheriff Hammett went to
arrest them he was shot dead.
Deputies attempted to apprchend
the men and a pitched battle fol
lowed in which the negroes kifl
ed two of the deputies and mor
tally wounded six other whites.
Guardsmen were rushed to the
scene to arrest the murderers
and to keep them from being
lynched, but arrived too late. The
mob had captured the men and
lynched them, after riddling their
bodies with builcts. The broth-
ers made desperate stand
against capture, although they
were surrounded by hundreds of
whites. Both of the Jones beysing
were under twenty years of age.
The governor has been requested
to send state troops to the city
to prevent a race riot, as the
whites are enraged over the killing
the sheriff and two depu-
ties. of

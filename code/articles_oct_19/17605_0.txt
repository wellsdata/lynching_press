A Shameful Story.
Writing of the Carrollton lynch
ing, the Times- Democrat corres
condent says:" They made these
speeches to the mob before it reach
led the jail; they made them again on
the way to the jail; they even put
their arms around the necks of the
mob's leaders and implored them to
halt. Judge Stevens and Mr. Hill
appealed to them as tenderly as a
mother would entreat her wayward
children.
Steadily the mob kept on its way
to the jail."
To this the Vicksburg Herald
adds:" What a spectacle have we
here! The officer in whom the law
lodges the power of sitting in judg.
ment when the question is life and
death, the District Attorney who
has taken his oath to stand up for
the state against crime, with" their is
arms around the neck" of a leader
of lawlessness" imploring him toy
halt." Not a word of command or
demand the
menace- no upon
Sheriff to do his duty! The surrender
of the law, the emblem of state
hood by their sworn and paid defenders
, was complete and absolute.
I
And to complete the shameful
farce the corroner's inquest was
held and a verdict of death by par
ties unknown rendered, where the
Judge, the District Attorney and
dozens of leading citizens knew
them; and ought to have gone be
that jury and named and de
fore nounced them. Poor Mississippi!

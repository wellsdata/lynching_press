AT St. Martinsville, Louisiana, three hundred
men took Joseph E. Jenkins, who murdered
his brother- in- law, Raphael Castille, a few
nights before, to the place of the murder, near
Breaux Bridge, and hanged him. On the way
from St. Martinsville they came across a colored
man, Eugene Azar, who killed a young man
January last, and Azar was hanged on the same
tree with Jenkins. The Governor offers a
reward of$ 2,000 the arrest and conviction of
the persons engaged for in the lynching.

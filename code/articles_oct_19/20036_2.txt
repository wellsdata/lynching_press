UNDER ARREST.
OMAHA, NEB., Oct. 10, 11 P. M.- Seven
members of the mob which lynched the
negro rapist last night are under arrest,
charged with murder in the first degree.
County Attorney Mahoney refused to allow
the release of the prisoners on bail,
and by 7 o'clock
to- night a large
crowd surrounded the county jail and
threatened that if the prisoners were not
given their liberty the jail would be at
tacked and the men liberated, The men
under arrest are Ed Neuschalfer, Patrick
Oheine, John Fritz, R. G. Bloom, H. H.
Brandis, Ed Fitzgerald and Joseph O'Donx
chue. Bloom is manager for S. P. Morse&
Co., the largest dry goods company in the
city, and O'Donohue is a captain of police.
Oheine was a delegate to the democratic
county convention and was arrested while
the convention was in session. County Attorney
Mahoney sent word that the men
would not be released under any circumstances
and the crowd at once began to
lay plans for attacking jail. The crowd
now is pretty quiet and the looks ugly.

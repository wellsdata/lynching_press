Mississippi Masons Avenge the Death of a
Brother Mason.
GREENWOOD, MISS., Sept. 25 .-- A negro
named Henry Taylor killed another on the
Tallahassee river about two months ago.
At that time an attempt was made by the
colored Masons to lynch him, but they
were prevented, a Mr. Stannoll taking
Taylor into his house and protecting him.
then both Taylor and his
wife have disappeared. One day
last week& body was found in
the river, which proved to be that of Tay
lor, and it is thought that the colored
Masons made away with him and his
wile. George Evans, who was hanged
here Jaly 2 by a negro mob, was sup
posed to have been lynched by colored
Masous because he had killed one of their
members. The feeling is getting to be
strong that the colored Mazons take an
oath in secret organizations to
avenge the their death of a brother Mason.

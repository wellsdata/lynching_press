"who live in the vicinity of Alexandria,",14387_0.txt
seven miles from Anniston and the scene,14387_0.txt
of the crime.,14387_0.txt
The story of how a negro entered the,14387_0.txt
home of John Williams is harrowing.,14387_0.txt
Williams is a farmer and has a farm in,14387_0.txt
"the famous Alexandria valley, near the",14387_0.txt
town of Alexandria. Wednesday afternoon,14387_0.txt
a negro went to the house and ask-,14387_0.txt
"ed Mrs. Williams for something to eat,",14387_0.txt
Mr. Williams being away at the time.,14387_0.txt
Mrs. Williams was the only one in the,14387_0.txt
"house, with the exception of a 2- year- old",14387_0.txt
"baby, who clung to its mother as she",14387_0.txt
went to the kitchen to get the negro,14387_0.txt
food. The negro followed the woman,14387_0.txt
"into the kitchen, when he grabbed a flat",14387_0.txt
iron and wielding it aloft brought it,14387_0.txt
"down upon the woman's head, crushing",14387_0.txt
the skull and rendering his victim unconscious,14387_0.txt
. Blood splattered in every direction,14387_0.txt

Posse Made Search.,14387_0.txt
A posse was soon formed and a search,14387_0.txt
made. One was suspected and,14387_0.txt
negro,14387_0.txt
"taken to the Williams home, where Mrs.",14387_0.txt
"Williams, after she regained consciousness",14387_0.txt

Physicians consider the condition of the,14387_0.txt
woman as very dangerous. At times she,14387_0.txt
"is conscious, and at others she lapses into",14387_0.txt
an unconscious state.,14387_0.txt
Thursday the negro Baker was suspected,14387_0.txt
", as it was said he had been near the",14387_0.txt
house on the day the crime was committed,14387_0.txt
. He was taken in charge by a,14387_0.txt
searching party and carried to the Wil-,14387_0.txt
liams home. The doctors stated that Mrs.,14387_0.txt
Williams was in a sane and conscious,14387_0.txt
state and the negro was taken before,14387_0.txt
her for identification. She could not say,14387_0.txt
"he was the party, but did not say he was",14387_0.txt
"not, so Friday morning the crowd took",14387_0.txt
Baker to Anniston. A crowd immediately,14387_0.txt
"collected and there was talk of lynching,",14387_0.txt
but the sheriff and prominent citizens,14387_0.txt
mounted a buggy in front of the county,14387_0.txt
jail and urged reason and patience. Upon,14387_0.txt
a promise that he would keep the negro,14387_0.txt
in jail here the crowd turned him over,14387_0.txt
to the sheriff. The crowd dispersed and,14387_0.txt
those who lived at Alexandria went,14387_0.txt
"home. In a few hours, however, a large",14387_0.txt
number of excited men gathered in front,14387_0.txt
"of the jail, and some in the party declared",14387_0.txt
they would override the sheriff and,14387_0.txt
"his deputies, and take the negro from",14387_0.txt
his cell.,14387_0.txt
Sheriff Woodruff immediately wired,14387_0.txt
"Governor Jelks, asking him to give him",14387_0.txt
authority to order out the troops. This,14387_0.txt
"was done, the governor in replying saying",14387_0.txt
that he would hold Sheriff Woodruff,14387_0.txt

The soldiers will probably be here until,14387_0.txt
"Monday, but further developments",14387_0.txt
must decide what steps will be taken.,14387_0.txt
Many people here are inclined to think,14387_0.txt
Baker is the wrong man. He was seen,14387_0.txt
today in his cell and admitted passing,14387_0.txt
"the Williams home on Wednesday, but",14387_0.txt

that a mob gathered here to try to lynch,14387_0.txt
"a man, especially as he had not even",14387_0.txt
been identified. The crowd was made,14387_0.txt
"up of the rougher element of the town, it",14387_0.txt
"is said, and some of them became excited",14387_0.txt

"of the Italian embassy here, on his personal",14745_0.txt
investigation of the recent brach of,14745_0.txt
"Sve Italians at Tallulah, La.",14745_0.txt
The report presents the affair in a serious,14745_0.txt
"light. As a whole, the Italian authoritie",14745_0.txt
view the matter of the lynching as one of,14745_0.txt
unusual atrocity and without the mitigating,14745_0.txt
circumstances which had been urg-,14745_0.txt
in the previous affairs of this kind.,14745_0.txt
In describing the first affray which led up,14745_0.txt
"to the Irnching, Marquin Romano's report",14745_0.txt
states that Dr. Hodges was the first to,14745_0.txt
"draw his weapon, and that not until he had",14745_0.txt
fired one shot and was about to fire the,14745_0.txt
"second one at Charles Defatta, who was at",14745_0.txt
"that time prostrate on the ground, did the",14745_0.txt
"brother, Joe Difatta, fire his shotgun from",14745_0.txt
"the store near by. This last shot, it is",14745_0.txt
"polated out, was in defense of the fallen",14745_0.txt
brother and was pot a wanton attack up,14745_0.txt
on Dr. Hodgen,14745_0.txt
The circumstances ing to the affair,14745_0.txt
are described in detail. According to,14745_0.txt
"this account, Charles Difatta was alone",14745_0.txt
when Dr. Hodges passed. There is no effort,14745_0.txt
made in the report to obscure the fact,14745_0.txt
that Chas. Difatta made the first offensive,14745_0.txt
overture. But it is contended that this,14745_0.txt
was not accompanied by the use of firearms,14745_0.txt
or even a movement to Craw them.,14745_0.txt
"It is said, however, that Charles Difatta",14745_0.txt
upbraided Dr. Hodges in an offensive way,14745_0.txt
"for having killed an animal, and accompanied",14745_0.txt
"this by a blow of the fist. Then,",14745_0.txt
"it is stated, Dr. Hodges shot at Difatta.",14745_0.txt
Whether or not the shot took effect it was,14745_0.txt
not possible for the Italian authorities to,14745_0.txt
"learn, as the bodies of the men, after being",14745_0.txt
"lynched, were disfigured and disposed of.",14745_0.txt
"But at all events, it is stated that Charles",14745_0.txt
Difatta was on the ground following the,14745_0.txt
shot from Dr. Hodges' weapon.,14745_0.txt
At this point Joe Difatta made his appearance,14745_0.txt
", and seeing his brother down and",14745_0.txt
"a second shot about to be fired, shot at Dr.",14745_0.txt
Hodges.,14745_0.txt
Then followed the lynching of these two,14745_0.txt
"Italians, Joe Difatta and Charles Difatta,",14745_0.txt
The mob took them before they had been,14745_0.txt
arrested.,14745_0.txt
"Up to this point, according to the Ital-",14745_0.txt
"lan report, only these Italians had figured",14745_0.txt
in the affair. The report goes on to state,14745_0.txt
"that throughout the occurrence, the three",14745_0.txt
"other Italians- Frank Dilatia, Joseph Fu-",14745_0.txt
diclo and John Gerami- were in another,14745_0.txt
"street, and did not know what was occurring",14745_0.txt
. It is stated that they did not take,14745_0.txt
"part in the attack on Dr. Hodges, and",14745_0.txt
that they did not even know of it until,14745_0.txt
"some time after, when the local officers",14745_0.txt
came to arrest them. This arrest was accomplished,14745_0.txt
and the three Italians were,14745_0.txt
actually placed in jail.,14745_0.txt
The report then brings out the alleged,14745_0.txt
"fact that the mob, having already lynched.",14745_0.txt
"Charles and Joe Difatta, turned their attention",14745_0.txt
to the three Italians under arrest.,14745_0.txt
Two of these men. Joseph Fudicio and,14745_0.txt

officers and lynched.,14745_0.txt
Subsequently and some little time er-,14745_0.txt

Significance of Lynchings.,14751_0.txt
There is more than ordinary signifl-,14751_0.txt
cance in this. Most people who have,14751_0.txt
studied conditions in the south know,14751_0.txt
that only an extremely small proportion,14751_0.txt
of the lynchings are for the crime,14751_0.txt
of assault. Southern men always bring,14751_0.txt
this to the front when they justify,14751_0.txt
lynching. Usually the most that could,14751_0.txt
be charged against the negro would be,14751_0.txt
impudence or insult to a white woman.,14751_0.txt
An assault committed in Alabama generally,14751_0.txt
results in some poor devil of a,14751_0.txt
negro being lynched in Mississippi for,14751_0.txt
impudence or for some misdemeanor,14751_0.txt

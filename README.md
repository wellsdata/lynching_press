Abstract	

This study examines US newspaper coverage of lynching from 1789 to 1963 in the most expansive analysis of lynching news coverage undertaken to date. News coverage began to exceed lynchings in 1893, according to a ratio measuring the two, at a time when lynching began to be more newsworthy. One possible factor was the pioneering work of Black journalist Ida B. Wells, who launched her high-profile anti-lynching campaign in 1892. Other factors could be the sheer number of lynchings, which had a spike in the early 1890s, as well as the rise of the Black public sphere and emergence of the `New South’ movement that viewed lynching as bad for the business climate. Implications of this finding are significant. It suggests Wells’ journalism challenged the public discourse in white newspapers to an extent not previously understood by scholars. Our study also found lynching coverage by predominantly white-owned newspapers diverged sharply from coverage in the Black press. Black newspaper articles tended to emphasize civil society narratives such as the need for due process in the legal system. Some news reports in predominantly white newspapers sought to normalize lynching by describing members of lynch mobs as good citizens seeking to pursue justice.

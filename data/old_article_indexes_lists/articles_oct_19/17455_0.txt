Leaders.
FRANK'S BODY TAKEN
TO HOME IN BROOKLYN
Few Curious Gather Before
House Where Funeral will
be Held Tomorrow.
Atlanta, Ga., Aug. 19- Governor
Harris planned to confer with the
members of the state prison commis-
relative to to be
taken for the arrest and conviction of
members of the mob which lynched
Leo M. Frank. This conference was
to be the first actual step on the part
of the state officials to place the
blame for the hanging.
All three members of the prison
commission Milledgeville
at,
were
where the Georgia prison farm is located
, on Monday night, last, when
Frank was abducted. Chairman R.
E. Davison has said he believes none
of the officers at the farm are to
blame for the loss of the prisoner,
declaring the mob was so well organized
that they were powerless.
Under Georgia law the Governor
can offer a maximum reward of$ 500
for each arrest and conviction.
" I probably will do this," said the
Governor." The abduction of the
state's ward, and his subsequent
lynching will be fully inquired into."
Governor Harris also announced
that he expected to issue a statement
sometime today on the lynching. He
said he had received many letters and
telegrams from outside the state ask-
ing what action would be taken by
the state and urging that a complete
investigation be made.
I. N. Ragsdale, acting mayor of Atlanta
, has made the following state
ment:
The daily and weekly press of Georgia
is practically unanimous in condemning
mob law and urging the governor
to take action in the Frank
case at once. He is investigating
now
and will probably offer a reward that
will bring the guilty parties to justice
.
While a large percentage of our
people believed Frank guilty, yet they
are law- abiding and heartily
prove the action of the mob." disap

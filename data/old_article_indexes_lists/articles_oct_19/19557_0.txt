CAIRO SHERIFF IS REMOVED
It Is Probable Deposed Official Will
Be Reinstated After
an
Investigation.
Springfield, Ill.- Sheriff F. R. Davis
of Alexander county, from whom the
Cairo mob took the negro James and
Lynched him, has been removed from
office by Gov. Deneen.
The governor acted under the mob
violence act of 1905 which leaves him
no discretion.
He must declare the
office vacant when the sheriff loses a
prisoner, but the act provides that the
governor may on request of the de
posed official make an investigation
and if convinced the sheriff did all in
his power to protect his prisoner re
instate him.
It is predicted that Davis will be
reinstated, though the governor
not admit it. would

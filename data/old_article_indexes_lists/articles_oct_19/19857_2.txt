Struggle Pledged
at Sacco- Vanzetti
Rally in Boston
1,500 on Boston Common Pledge to Fight for
Ideals of Two Legally Murdered
BOSTON, Mass., Aug. 22.- With bared heads and clenched fists, 1,500
workers stood on Boston Common today and, on the sixth anniversary of the
murder of Sacco and Vanzetti, pledged that as long as life lasts they will
carry on the struggle of the workers against oppression, the cause in which
and Vanzetti met death.
Sacco Frank Spector, of the International Labor Defense, who had been a
jail mate of Tom Mooney in San
Quentin, sentenced to 42 years as
the leader of the Imperial Valley
strikers, and finally released through
the mass protest of workers led by
the International Labor Defense,
called on those present to enlist in
the fight for the freeing of the present
day class war prisoners.
Comrade Spector told of the
frame- up of Tom Mooney, in San
Quentin for 17 years because, like
Sacco and Vanzetti, he led in the
struggle of the workers, of the Scotts-
boro boys, framed up in Alabama and
sentenced to die because they are
Negro toilers, just as Sacco and Van-
zetti were persecuted because they
were active in behalf of the foreign
born workers; of the deportation
cases against Edith Berkman, Massachusetts
textile worker; Sam Paul,
unemployed leader, still held in jail
in Providence, R. I., and facing deportation
because he refused to testify
against himself; and of the
lynching of the Tuscaloosa Negroes.
There was loud applause when
Comrade Spector said," Let us pledge
ourselves to carry on the fight not
only to free these class war prison-
ers, but to destroy this rotten frame
up system of capitalism and set up
instead a working class society."
Jack McCarthy, district secretary
of the Trade Union Unity League,
completely exposed the National ReCovery
Act" They give blue
. us more
eagles," he said," but the conditions
of the workers keep getting bluer
and bluer." McCarthy spoke of conditions
of the workers in the shoe
and textile industry of Massachusetts
and the necessity for the workers
building their own unions.
Jessica Henderson, chairman of the
N.E. committee for the Defense of
Political Prisoners was chairman. She
went into the lives of Sacco and
Vanzetti, and of the role played by
the Boston" society" Lowell, Fuller,
Strotton, Grant, Thayer, etc., in carrying
through the murder of Sacco
and Vanzetti.
Prof. Harry Dana, like Jessica Henderson
, connected with the Sacco
Vanzetti defense through seven long
years of the fight, read the letters
of Vanzetti to him which appeared
in the Daily Worker." From
bridge where I live," said Harry Cam-
LYNN, Mass., Aug. 22.- After po
lice had succeeded in preventing a
scheduled Sacco- Vanzetti- Scottsboro
Demonstration today in front of
Lynn City Hall, 200 workers gath-
ered on the Common. Police made
attempts to demoralize the workers
here also, but militant protest by
the Lynn I. L. D. forced the open-
ing of the bandstand.
The meeting was addressed by
Manuel Blanc. Dist. Org. Sec'y of
the I. L. D., who pointed out the increasing
terror under the N. R. A.,
giving as an example the recent
sell- out of the Lynn shoe strike, and
Howard Carter of the Boston Scotts-
boro Action Committee, who drew
the lessons of the Sacco- Vanzetti
case and called for real
of Negro and white workers solidarity.
Dana," At sunset you can look across
at the skyline beyond the Charles
River, and see the Bunker Hill monu-
ment, monument to" liberty." On
that same sky- line, can be seen
standing the Charleston jail, where
Sacco and Vanzetti
were put to
death."
Dana, who was delegate to the
World Congress against war spoke of
the activities of Sacco and Vanzetti
against the bosses world war, and of
the necessity, in carrying forward the
struggle for which Sacco and Van-
zetti died, of fighting against the
danger of a new bosses war at the
present time. The fight of Sacco
Vanzetti will not end until capitalism
is overthrown, Dana said.
Resolutions were sent to the Gov.
Miller of Alabama demanding the release
of the Scottsboro Boys, to Gov.
Rolfe
demanding he release of
Mooney. The release of Sam Paul of
Providence was also demanded.
The speech of Hector Thomas, of
the Scottsboro Committee, a Negro
worker showing the Scottsboro fight
as the same fight as Sacco- Vanzetti,
was one of the most enthusiastic received
. When the resolution was introduced
demanding the death penalty
for the shefit. the judge and the
lynchers who had a hand in the
lynching of Tuscaloosa Negro
workers, there the was great applause.

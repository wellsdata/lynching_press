Three Negroes Lynched in Texas.
Three negroes- Prince Woods, Tom
Smith and Henry Gaines- confessed to
having committed an outrage upon
Mrs. Gilsey near Sturgis, Tex. Upon
confession being made, ten men were
deputized to convey the negroes to
Woodville jail. When about a mile
from Sturgis, fifty masked men demanded
the negroes and the demand
was acceeded to. The guards were ordered
to retrace their steps, which
they did. A few moments later a vol
ley from the guns of the masked men
told the fate of the negroes. The deputies
returned to the spot and found
the negroes literally riddied with
lets and all dead. bul

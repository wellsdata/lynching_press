A Montana Desperado Hanged by a Mob
at Miles City- The Towa Partially Destroyed
by Incendiaries.
ST. PAUL, MINN., July 26.
A Miles City special says that a party of
masked men proceeded to the County Jail
yesterday, overpowered the Jailer, and
seized a man named Rigney whom they
took about a mile out of town and hanged
to the projecting end of a railroad tie over
a culvert. Rigney had been jailed the day
before for disorderly conduct, and bore a
reputation as a hard citizen having been
,
accused of robbery and other crimes. He
was a bartender in the saloon of the
Cosmopolitan Theater. Two hours
theater
after he hung the
was
burst into flames, and was completely
destroyed, with six other build
ings, among which was a large drug store.
The progress of the fire was arrested by
the brick building of the First National
Bank, otherwise the entire block would have
been destroyed. The total loss is estimated
at$ 50,000. It is generally thought that the
was the work of an incendiary, in re
fire taliation for the hanging of Rigney.

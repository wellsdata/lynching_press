SHELBYVILLE, Ind., Aug. 23.- Don
Bruce, city marshal, was shot and fa
tally wounded last night by Charley
Hawkins, a desperado, who was lynched
by a mob a few hours later. Hawkins
was in a quarrel when Bruce came upon
the scene and requested him to cease
his disturbance. Hawkins then reached
for his revolver, and with an oath fired
three shots in succession at Bruce, each
bullet taking effect. Hawkins fired
twice more, but missed and started to
run, with Bruce following. When about

under arrest and immediately fell. He

keep back the other prisoners. Hawkins
was in the rear cell, and when the mob
reached that portion of the jail he fell
upon his face, placed his hands over his
eyes and said:" Please let me pray.'
The committee did not wait, but proceeded
to tie his hands and feet and
to adjust the rope about his neck.
In a moment six men came rushing out
of the jail pulling their victim by the

the rope thrown over a limb, and a second

mid air. Eight shots were then fired
into his body, and the dreadful work
was over. The mob immediately dispersed

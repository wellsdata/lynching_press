So Says Governor Aycock- He has been
Wanting to Make this Declaration
for a Long Time.

Raleigh, N. C., July 13.
Governor and Mrs. Aycock expected
to leave for Morehead City at 5 o'clock
this morning, but on account of a heavy
rain storm waited until this afternoon.
Your correspondent met the governor
at his office this morning and his excellency
said:" I am officially advised by
an association at Seattle, in the state of
Washington, that it is formed for the
purpose of preventing lynchings and
that it offers$ 500 reward for each and
every person concerned in any lynch
ing. I am also officially notified that it
has offered such rewards for each and
every participant in the lynchings this
year at LaGrange and Smithfield, and
that it has put up the money. I do
not care for outside aid in securing law
and order in North Carolina, but I have
possitively decided that hereafter, no
matter what the crmie may be I will
offer$ 400 reward, which is the limit
under the law for each and every participant
. I recognize that there is a
crime for which the penalty is certain
death, but the criminal must be hanged
by law and not by a mob. Lynching
has got to stop in North Carolina. I
ask you to call on the press and the
preachers in the state to stop the tendency
towards lynch law. It is a great
blot in the state."
The governor has for some time been
wanting to make this declaration. He
now makes it fairly and squarely. It
is a new departure. His hope has been
that no lynching would occur during
his administration. There have been
three- the two named and one of a ne
gro in Cumberland county.
Governor Aycock leaves Morehead
City for Wrightsville Monday and that
afternoon will review the Third regiment
at Camp Aycock. The next morn
ing he will see guard mount and drill
and inspect the camp and see the
cers and men. offi

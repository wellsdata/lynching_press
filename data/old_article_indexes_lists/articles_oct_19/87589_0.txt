SINGULAR KIDNAPPING.- Mr. Dennis, superintendent
of the Buffalo and State Line Railroad, was
found guilty of kidnapping, by an Erie jury, on
Thursday. The charge arose from the late Erie
Railroad disturbance. It appears that when the
mob endeavored to lynch Dennis, the cars were put
in motion to protect him, and a Harbor Creek man,
Cooper, who was on the train, was carried into
Mr. New York State.

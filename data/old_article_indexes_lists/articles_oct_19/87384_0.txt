VIOLENT RACE WAR.
Twelve People Kiired in a Riot Beiween
whites and Blacks at Forest, Mrs ..
New Orleans, Oct. 24.- The Picayunes
Forest, Miss., special says:
Eleven dead negroes, one dead white
man and one negro and three white
men seriously wounded, is the result
of a bloody war being waged between
the white and black races in the Harp-
ersville neighborhood, of this, Scott
county.
Several of the rioters have been arrested
and lodged in jail, but the others
escaped the swamps
. Large
into
crowds of white men are in close pursuit
, however, and inore names are
hourly expected to be added to the
death list. The following is a partial
list of the killed:
FISH BURK, black.
J. E. CATEWOOD, black.
HENRY ANDERSON, black.
JOHN GATEWOOD, black
HUGH ANDERSON, black.
SIM HARALSON, black.
W. H. SIBLEY, white.
It is impossible to obtain a full list
of the killed, for the reason that some
of the negroes were shot down in the
woods and were hurridly buried by the
whites. A member of the posse sald
that he helped bury the negroes in
trenches, but neither hieself or any
one in his crowd knew their names as
they did not care enough about them
to enquire.
Gov. Me Laurn went to Harpersville
last night and appealed to the whites
not to molest the prisoners in the cus
today of the sheriff. His talk had a
good effect on the majority of those in
the crowd, but some of the hot headed
members did not relish the governors
ference, but he finally persuaded
them to permit the sheriff to take the
prisoners to jail.
Sheriff Stephenson has placed additional
guards at the Forest jail to pre
vent lynching. Twonegroes have made
full confession.
The funeral of the murdered officer,
Sibley, occurred today and was large-
ly attended. It is reported here that
two of the murdered mans brothers
are on their way from his home in Ya
zoo county at the head of a large crowd
bound for the scene of the race war.
It is feared that when they arive a
determined and successful assault will
be made on the Forest" jail and the
prisoners lynched.
Later Sheriff Stephenson considered
the situation so serious tonight he decided
to take the prisoners to Meridian
for safe keeping. A large posse was
organized and the negroes will
placed on the 9 o'clock train. be

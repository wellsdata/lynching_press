COL. COMPTON INDIGNANT.
WALL WALLA, Wash., April 27.
Judge Upton has called on Col. Comp
ton, commanding Fort Walla Walla,
for aid in ferreting out the soldiers who
lynched murderer Hunt Friday night.
The colonel said he would lend all aid
in his power and that only misconception
of the gravity of the situation
on his part prevented his taking more
active steps to prevent the trouble. He
stigmatized the action of the mob as a
disgrace to himself, his officers, the
troops, and the entire.

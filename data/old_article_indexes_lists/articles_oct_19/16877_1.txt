if I did not hear of a man being murdered near
St Louis in the year 1311, and of two men
being arrested, both tried and convicted, one
him the other being
having a new trial granted,
hung. I told him that I thought I had. He
said he was the man that had the new trial
and' said he
granted and acquitted;,
was,
,
hey hung the wrong man; he was innoceat;
I am the guilty man; but they hung him and
cleared me. But,' says, I you were under
a different name still, at that time.' He said,
Yes, by none of these names do you know
me, but my real name you are familiar
with. Your name,' said he, I knew in the
year 1332; the gamblers called you John, but
Jonathan is your real name.' My curiosity
was highly excited at the strange manage
ment of the murderer. But you may imagine
inererse of it when he told me his real
the bame.

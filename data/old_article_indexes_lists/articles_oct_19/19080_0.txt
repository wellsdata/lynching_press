FOILS MOB, KILLS HIMSELF.
Crown Had Shot Sweetheart and Her
Mother, and Then Fled.
Altoona, Pa.- After killing the
girl he had been forbidden to court,
John Crown fatally wounded her
mother with a second bullet and then,
having fallen exhausted at the end of
a two- mile pursuit, shot himself to
cheat a mob of would- be lynchers.
Crown came from England two
months ago and took quarters withing
Mrs. Harriet Nevlin and her daughter
Jennie at Sandy Ridge, two miles
from here. For his unwelcome attentions
to the girl he was turned out
of the house.
Crown returned to the cottage and
called for the girl. She would not
see him, and, forcing his way into
the house, he found her in her bed
room and shot her through the heart.
Mrs. Nevlin grappled with the murderer
, and he put a second bullet
through her lungs.
Outside, attracted by the shots, a
crowd of brickmakers had gathered.
Crown dashed through their ranks
and into the woods. When escape
was impossible, he fired the last
let through his own heart. bul

We were slow in entering the war,
and we have been slow in realizing
that our part in it would be anything
more than a grand final parade. We
should have begun preparing the day
Belgium was invaded been
to declare war when the Lusitania
was sunk. If we had
done so, the
war would now likely have been
over, and billions of treasure and
millions of lives might have been
saved.
But President Wilson and
the other pacifists would not listen
to wise counsel of this kind. Instead
of leading the people, the President,
as regards the war, has moved only
under compulsion of public opinion,
when action could be no longer de-
layed. Since we at last got into the
war things have begun to move with
accelerated rapidity, and one now
feels that we shall soon be able to
do something. While the growth of
the feeling of our responsibility, not
only to ourselves, but also to our al-
lies and the rest of the world, al-
though slow, has been a satisfactory
thing to watch, it has unfortunately
been attended by circumstances of a
disquieting nature, tending to fill one
with anxiety for the future. Not
only have many persons in various
parts of the country been suspected
of disloyalty and roughly handled
without cause but acts have been perpetrated
which have lowered us in
our own estimation and hurt us in
the opinion of the world, though the
participants in their blindness may
have fancied that they were doing a
brave and
patriotic thing. In Illi-
nois some months ago a man of little
influence, who had been put in jail
for supposed disloyal language, was
taken out by a mob and hanged. The
purpose was to give the culprit a coat
of tar and feathers, a punishment
which would have been quite severe
enough if the man had been proved
guilty, but he was killed without
trial and while protesting his loyalty
and innocence. The crowd finding
they had not had the foresight to
provide themselves with the necessary
tar and feathers, and not being
in a mood to be cheated out of a
thrilling experience, some one suggested
that they hang the man. This
was done, and the great state of Illinois
has not been able to convict a
single one of the many
in the crime. participants

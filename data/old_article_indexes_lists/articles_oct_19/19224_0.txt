Sam Mitchell, one of the leaders in
the mob that recentiy lynched a negro
at Joplin, a few months ago, has been
convicted of murder in the second degree
and sentenced to the penitentiary
for ten years. It is a just verdict and
will, no doubt, exert an influence that
will go far toward destroying the
of mob law, which is rarely, if
crime ever, justifiable.

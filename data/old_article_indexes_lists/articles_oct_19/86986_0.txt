A Murderer Lynched.
MARYSVILLE, Kansas, March 22.
About forty masked men went to the jail
last night and five of them entered the
jailor's residence and presented revolvers
to his head and compelled him to open
the jail doors. Samuel Frayer, convicted
of the murder of John Pennington and
his wife, was then taken out and conducted
to a wagon bridge in the southern
part of town and hanged. He is said to
have made a full confession, stating he
had no accomplices in the murder. The
mob were quiet and dispersed as soon as
the work was done.
Last night twenty- five or thirty masked
men rode up to the jail, took Freyer out,
and going to Spring creek, a small stream
half a mile from town, threw a rope over
a beam of the bridge and he was swung
off into eternity. When the rope was
placed around his neck he was asked if he
had anything to say. He said" yes,"
and proceeded to give a full detailed ac
count of the awful and cold- blooded mur
der of John Pennington and his wife,
which he committed about the middle of
February, near Frankfort, Kansas. The
victims were found dead in a barn several
days after the murder. They had been
Mrs.
was
saulted in a most brutal manner by Freyer as.

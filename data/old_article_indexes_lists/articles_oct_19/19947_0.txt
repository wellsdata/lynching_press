THE prevailing high winds have occasioned
several expensive casualties in
Pontiac and vicinity. The plate- glass
front of A. Parker's drug store was
blown in, entailing$ 90 damage. Sheets
of whirling about the streets have
paper
occasioned runaways, the most serious
of which was the team of Robert Han
wells of Orion, which ran into and broke
up five delivery and express wagons.
THE State Convention of Afro- American
citizens was held at Lansing. The
avowed object of the convention was to
discuss and devise ways and means
to improve the condition of the colored
race in the State, and to aid in securing
more extensive political recognition.
The convention adopted resolutions in
dorsing the administration of President
Harrison, commending the administration
of the Republican party in Michi
gan, extending a vote of thanks to Al
bion W. Tourgee for his work in the
amelioration of the condition of the colored
race, asking Congress for the pas
sage of a national election bill, and condemning
the recent lynching of negroes
in the South. Pandemonium reigned
when the matter of selecting a name for
the organization came up for consideration
. Every delegate was an orator, and
they all sought to air their oratory
simultaneously. A motion final prevailed
, when the delegates were at last
exhausted, providing for the appoint
ment of a committee who should settle
the disputed question. This committee
recommended that the organization be
called the Michigan Equal Rights Association
, and the recommendation of the
committee was adopted by a majority
vote. Officers were elected as follows:
President, W. S. Miller, Lansing: See
retary, T. P. Wood, Adrian; Treasurer,
C. Ellis, Saginaw. Vice Presidents
were W. elected for every county.

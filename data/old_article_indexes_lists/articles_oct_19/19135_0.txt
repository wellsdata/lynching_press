Eastern Shore Stirred by
Atrocious Crime Commit
ted by Colored Man.
SALISBURY, Md., June 4 .-- Foiling the
mob bent on lynching the colored assailant
of old girl,
a fourteen- year-
Sheriff Harding P Tull whisked the
prisoner, Wesley Miles, by automobile
and train through Somerset county and
to Seaford, Del. There the mob lost the
scent. it became generally
known that Tull was taking the prisoner
to Baltimore, where he would be
lodged in the city jail.
Somerset is wild with rage over the
crime. The girl victim is the daughter
of former Sheriff William Phillips and,
cowed by threats, she fell prey to the
assailant, she told her mother. Quietly
Miles was arrested on a warrant, then
the chase by the lynchers began. The
mob searched the jall at Salisbury, but
the sheriff did not take his man therc.
Knowing well what would happen when
once the news had spread, Sheriff Tu!
took an automobile, put the prisoner
on the floor of the car, and made his
run to Seaford, where the train was
flagged just outside the town.
The assault for which Miles is want
ed by the lynching party was particularly
atrocious. Three weeks ago he
made an attempt, it is charged, but
failed. Showing the child a glittering
knife, he said he would kill her if
she breathed a word to her people.
Yesterday he repeated the assault, the
child told later, and then it was that
she became hysterical and sobbing
to her mother. ran

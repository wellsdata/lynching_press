Forge May Result in Serious Trouble ..
Lynching of Three Negroes at Clifton
FORGE, Va., Oct. 20.- The
lynching of the three negroes Saturday
night has caused the greatest excite
ment here. Armed negroes assembled
in the streets and made threats of retaliation
. So demonstrative were the
blacks for revenge that the mayor telegraphed
to the governor for assistance.
The white population organized and stationed
men at different points where it
was thought attacks would be made. If
the negroes attempt an attack on the
town a most bloody conflict will ensue.
The entire town is in arms. It was
stated that the governor had ordered out
the Monticello guards to protect the
town. The negroes are massed in large
numbers in their own section of the
town. Many are under the influence of
liquor and making boisterous
straiions. demon

WHY LYNCHED.
" The question has been asked,' Why
are negroes lynched in the South since
the war?' I reply that nearly every
case of such lynching was for brutal
outrage on the wives and daughters of
white people. The scroundrel who
committs such crimes deserves to die.
I am opposed to lynch law, not that I
think it cruel for such guilty villains,
but because it is opposed to civilization
and good government. Miss Ida
Wells ought to make these things
known in England, and tell why the
lynching done in the South. Let
her make known is the devilish cause.

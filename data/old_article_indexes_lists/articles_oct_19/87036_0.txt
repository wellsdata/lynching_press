Starts Fighting;
Troops Called
WEST FRANKFORT, III., Aug.
6. Following a night of rioting,
in which five were killed and
scores injured, comparative quiet
was restored today. Five thou
sand foreigners, against whom
rioters directed their attack. had left
town, and this. coupled with the arrival
of 150 militiamen of the Ninth lli
nois Infantry, tended to bring order.
The trouble started over the murder
of two Italian boys Tuesday. They
were murdered because, it was said,
they were about to reveal information
implicating several foreigners of West
Frankfort in recent robberies. The
mob attempted to lynch the prisoners
held for the murder of the boys and
the resultant riot started.
Troops were stationed in sections of
the town principally inhabited by those
of foreign birth and instructed to protect
property abandoned by fugitives.
Emphatic instructions that all crowds
be dispersed immediately were
the militiamen. given

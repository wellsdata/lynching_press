The assassination of Mayor G. W.
Lewis at his home in Clinton, Hinds
county, on Friday night a week ago,
threw the whole community into deepest
sorrow, until relieved on Saturday
by the confession of Anderson Harris,
a colored Baptist preacher. Harris
said that he alone did the work, be
cause Lewis was aiding his wife to
prevent a divorce, which he was seeking
at the hands of the court. His mo
tive in laying the crime on Hudson, a
colored man was, to prevent lynching,
which he knew he would receive at
, being now safe in the jail at
Jackson Clinton.

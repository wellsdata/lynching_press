pass."
Letters received here from San Francisco,
give the following account of the difficulty on
board the ship Challenge: -When the vessel arrived
off Rio, the crew some fifty to sixty, broke
out in open mutiny, with the intention to seize
the ship, murder the Captain and mate, and give
her in command of one of their company, and
go roving. The mate was knocked down and
stabbed by the crew, but was rescued by the
Captain, who succeeded in bringing them to du
ty, not however until some of them were severely
hurt, seven of whom having previously
been siek with the dysentery and seurvy, died
on the passage. Some of the sailors ran away
before the ship came to the wharf, and related
such shocking stories of the manner in which
they had been treated, that a great excitement
was created among the boatmen and the sailors
on the wharf, who crowded the deck of the ship,
for the Captain and mate, to lynch
them hunting.

" Last year your country, the so-
called' land of the free and the home
the brave,' lynched sixty- two human
beings, among them Prager and
fifty- eight Negroes. Some day, and
the day is not far away, you will have
to account for the wholesale killings
of your colored brothers; and I assure
you at the first opportunity the
colored south will throw off your mis-
and create its own free, independent
rule government.

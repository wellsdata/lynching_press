It is clear then, that the existence of the death
penalty does not prevent murder, nor will it pre-
vent mobs. To prevent mobs the mode it seems
to us is perfectly plain. Let those engaged in
them be dealt with properly. They murdered
both Mayberry and De Bar in a more revolting
spirit and shocking manner, than they murder-
ed their vietims. We do not ask that they shall
be killed in return. Let them be shut up in the
Penitentiary for a life time and we will be re
-
,
sponsible for any similar mobs which will eccur
during the next quarter of a century.
In conclusion, it will be recollected, that soon
after the abolition of the death penalty in Michi-
an, several shocking murders occurred there in
rapid succession. There as here, there was much
excitement and feeling, and those who favored
the death penalty were clamorous for its restoration
, and predicted such restoration, as soon
as the Legislature met, without a question. But
the Legislature did not restore it. Michigan
adhered to her policy, and at the present time
her criminal statistics compare favorably with
other states and no thought of restoring the
death penalty is entertained.
Wisconsin will probably do as Michigan has
done, and with the same result. Last winter
legislature elected with no experience as to the
measure happened to be friendly to the restoration
of the death penalty. The public attention being
fairly aroused we doubt whether any
accident will again occur. such

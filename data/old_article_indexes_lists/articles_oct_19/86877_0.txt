BILL DEFEATED

Would Allow Dictation to
Judiciary.
MONSIGNOR LUCEY
For
Urged Passage of the Measure
: Weeks ---- Representative Rowell
Made Strong Plea for Its Adoption
-The Opposition.
The Oldham anti- lynching bill met
defeat in the house Saturday after-
noon after a severe attack made upon
its provisions by Killough and Mc
Collum, who charged that it was revolutionary
and would place the sheriff
of any county in an attitude of dictat-
ing to the judiciary. Under the bill
any sheriff who held a prisoner
against whom the community was
aroused, and who feared that such
prisoner would suffer from lynch law
could order the Circuit Court in session
for immediate trial of the case.
The bill was called up by Representative
Alex Rowell, who stated
that it was a solution of the lynch
problem that had been presented by
Father Lucey of Pine Bluff, and that
this distinguished man believed iting
would serve to reduce mob violence
in the South. Mr. Rowell made a
strong plea that Arkansas give the
law a test.
The bill amends the law in regard
to special sessions of court, that A
sheriff might call for a special session
of the Circuit Court within ten days
rewhere public sentiment is aroused, or
where there is probability of a lynch
ing, was taken up and killed.
Mr. Killough led the opposition to
the bill. He quoted Governor Varda
man of Mississippi, who said on one
oocasion:" As governor of Mississippi
or sheriff of Coahoma county, I
would turn over heaven or hell to
stop a lynching, but as a private citizen
I would participate or lead it
when an unmentionable crime had
been committed by a member of the
black race against the fair woman
hood of the state." Mr. Killough did
not believe that a special session of
court in ten days would prevent a
lynching.
" When a mob is aroused,' said Mr.
Killough," it wants parts of the vic
tim to dangle as watchcharms and
souvenirs, and is never willing to wait
ten days for a special session of
court." Mr. Killough believed that it
was wrong to bring a woman who had
been outraged into any open court to
testify against a black brute before
a gaping crowd, and stated that the
only solution of the question of.
lynchings in the South was an amend
ment to the constitution which woul.1
give a court the right to try a ne
gro charged with a numentionable
crime in private. He believed this
would save the finger of scorn from
being pointed at the women who had
been victimized.
Mr. McCullom opposed the passage
of the bill, objecting to that feature
which placed a penalty on any judge
who did not hold a special session of
court in response to a call from a
sheriff. He believed that the judiciary
should be free from such threats
to be fined for using discretion. He
declared the law the most revolutionary
he had ever seen." Our courts
should be above the clamor of the
people," said Mr. McCullom," and we
should keep good men on the bench
responsible and then not
who are
hamper them with such mandates.
Mr. Rowell defended the bill, saying"
had been conceived by Father Lucey
of Pine Bluff, who had made a study
of the situation." Father Lucey regards
this bill as a solution of the
problem of lynch law in the South,"
said Mr. Rowell," and he wants Ar
kansas to give it a tritl." Answering
the argument against bringing out
raged women into courts to testify
against those who had assaulted them,
Mr. Rowell stated that in his district
an instance like this came up, and
the judge promptly ordered the court
room cleared of every person but the
jury and lawyers, and that he believ
ed other judges should follow the ex
ample.
Mr. Oldham stated that he believed
the sheriffs of the county were better
judges of the conditions in a community
than a judge who lives in another
county, and he believed the sheriff
should have the right to call special
sessions of court to meet emergencies.
He believed it were better that a wo
man be brought into an orderly court
to testi than to be dragged before a
maddened mob to identify a brute,
was often the case. as

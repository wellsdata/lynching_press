Another Report.
ST. LOUIS, July 24.- A special from
Springfield, Mo., says: Traveling Audi-
tor Townsend of the Gulf road arrived in
that city at noon from the South and verifies
the report of one of the negro county
officials having been lynched by a mob of
white men. Townsend says it is a difficult
matter to get any details of the proceedings
at Marion which is under a
guard of armed men. A general state of
excitement prevails, that neither couriers
or messengers are allowed to go in or out
and the telegraph operator is confined to
the sending of train orders.
Townsend states that the victim was a
county official and one of the banished
eighteen. The mob seized him while he
was endeavoring to effect an entrance to
the court house, dragged him to the
woods at the edge of town, and after a
desperate struggle strung him up. It is
claimed that Governor Hughes at Little
Rock has been called upon for protection,
and if this be true details must be forth
coming. It is also claimed that an armed
of white men have
not Ridge to Marion to aid the whites,
who look for a serious uprising of
groes. ne

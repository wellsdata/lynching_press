Mob Rule to Go.
Omaha, Aug. 4.- To the Editor of
The Bee: In full accord with the
spirit of world- rebellion against despotism
is the practical, concrete- based
movement just being originated in the
southwest to uproot mob rule. The
San Antonio Express announces:" The
establishment of a fund totaling
$ 100,000 to be maintained for five
years for the purpose of combating
and punishing lynching and mob violence
within the bounds of the
tinental United States;$ 100 to each con
person directly responsible for arrest
and subsequent conviction of any per
son or persons instrumental in arousing
a mob to commit lynching, or participating
in the lynching itself, when
the victim is white;$ 1,000 when he is
negro."
a
to old Texas!

Lynch Law continues to prevail in California
although it has been banished from the precincts
of the larger cities, and has retreated to the
placers and small towns. By the last steamer's
news we were informed of no less than five men
having been hung by lyuch law, in various parts
of the State. One of these was a professional
gambler, who quarreled with and killed a trader,
with a whom he was playing onte. He was
hung at Shasta. Two others robbed and murder
ed a couple of storekeepers at Eureka, and the
remaining two of the five were Mexican horse
thieves, who were executed summarily at Mon
terey.
In all of these cases the miserable wretches
who suffered the penalty of death for their crimes,
were regularly tried by a lynch court and jury,
according to the forms and usages of gen ine
law, though rejecting the technicalities; and,
curiously enough, one of the trials, that at Eureka
, lasted a whole week, clearly evincing that the
lynchers were not so intent upon the punish
ment of the offenders as to deny them the justice
of a full hearing first

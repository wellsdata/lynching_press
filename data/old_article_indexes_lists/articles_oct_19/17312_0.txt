INDIGNATION MEETING.- We stated yesterday
that the people of Greenbrier recently held a meet
ing to express their sense of indignation at the
acquittal of Dr. Thompson. Gen. Lewis, sheriff
of the county, presided over the meeting, and several
speeches were made. A series of resolutions,
offered by C. L. Wheler, passed unanimously. The
resolutions express the opinion that the evidence
was overwhelmingly sufficient to convict Dr
Thompson; that the jury is either perjured or in
competent; and concludes with the following:
Resolved, That it is time, when the laws fail as
in this case, to protect the sacredness of persons
and the sanctity of virtue, that we should appeal to
the last resort of Human Justice- Lynch Law.
Resolved, That it will be the stern duty of any
community, into which Dr. Thompson should come,
immediately Lynch
Resolved, That if he comes here, we, the
of Greenbrier, will Lynch him. People

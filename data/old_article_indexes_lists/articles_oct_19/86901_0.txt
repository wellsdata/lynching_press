Booth had some trouble last Monday

been arrested and placed under
bond for assaulting Mrs. Moone.

The affair created great
among the factory operatives of Griffin.
Booth asked Mrs. Moone, it is said, to
do certain work, which she declined to
do without a ticket, such as she claimed
was given all operatives. This led to a
dispute, and while Booth was attempt
ing to eject her from the building, she
was painfully injured, and is now con
fined to her bed.
Late yesterday afternoon Booth was
requested to go to Mrs. Moone's house
and apologize. When he reached the
house a crowd gathered, and Booth was
denounced in strong language. A fight
ensued, in which Booth received several
blows. It was after this that he received
the warning to leave Griffn.
Booth was released yesterday on bond.
The talk of personal injury to him if
he did not leave town grew so strong
this evening that the militia was called
out. This had a quieting effect on the
groups of men gathered near Booth's
house, and at midnight it was believed
attempt to harm had been given
the up.

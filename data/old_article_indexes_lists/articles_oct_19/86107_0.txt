EXCITEMENT IN NATCHEZ.- The Vicksburg Whig of the
10th inst., says:
" We learn from a gentleman from Natchez, that the
people of that city were intensely excited on Saturday
last, in consequence of the perpetration of a most beast
ly outrage on the person of a young girl, about 11 years
old, by a fellow named Smitzer. When they left, there
was every indication that lynch law would be resqrted to.
" We also learn that a man named Quin shot a negro
there on Friday, and on Saturday, Quin's father shot an
other man."
A despatch to the New Orleans papers, dated at Natch
ez, 10th inst., states that Smitzer was taken to prison on
Saturday, but that the excitement of the populace continued
to increase until Tuesday evening, when they assembled
in a great crowd, and marched deliberately to
the jail, took the prisoner from his cell, and hung him in
courthouse yard. Everything passed off quietly, and
the at 3 o'clock the crowd dispersed.

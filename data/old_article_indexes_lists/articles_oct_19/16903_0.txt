LYNCH LAW.- The Vicksburg Whig relates an
instance of this summary method of punishment,
which recently occurred in that place. It seems
that the wharf- boat had been robbed of three or
four hundred dollars; a man by the name of Robin
son was suspected of having stolen the money, was
taken up by several persons and threatened with
hanging if he did not confess the theft and refund
the stolen property. At first, Robinson said the
money could be found in a cabin below the race
track, where, on examination, it was not found.
He then declared that it had been stolen by a John
McQuade, who was waked up, taken out of bed
and whipped nearly to death, all the while alleging
his innocence. After being whipped, McQuade
was brought into the presence of Robinson, when
the latter denied all knowledge of the former, and
confessed that he had implicated McQuade merely
order to gain time and save himself.

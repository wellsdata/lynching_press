Negro Lynched in Georgia.
26.- Hicks
Jacksonville, Fla., Nov.
Price, a negro charged with rape, was
taken from the jail at Starke by a mob
of about a hundred quiet but determined
men, hanged to the limb of a tree and
about fifty shots fired into his body.
The mob gained entrance to the jail by
pretending to have another prisoner, then
overpowered the jailer. The work was
done before the town realized the mob's
presence. Price had always been considered
an inoffnsive negro before his crime.
He was fully identified. The town is
and no further trouble is antici
quiet pated.

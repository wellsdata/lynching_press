Reward For Proof.
A mob raided the city prison of
Pensacola on Monday morning over-
,
powering the officers by force of arms,
and took a negro prisoner, Dave
Alexander, from the prison and
hanged him in the Plaza. When
strung up by a rope the body of the
negro was riddled with bullets. Alex-
ander had confessed to the murder of
Police Officer R. J. Carter. The city
council, of Pensacola, has offered re
wards for proof to convict the members
of the mob. The lynching ha
been called to the attention of Governor
Gilchrist, who promises to
make a thorough investigation before
he acts in the matter.-

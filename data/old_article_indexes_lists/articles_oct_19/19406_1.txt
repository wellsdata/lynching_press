Lynching of a Wife Murderer.
George Graham, the wife murderer, was
lynched at Springfield, Mo., by a mob.
Several men, heavily armed, called the
sheriff to the door, seized and forced him
to give up the keys. Then they went to
the cell and opened the door. Graham
was in his bunk, and was commanded
to get up. He was at first infuriate
and replied with oaths, but he was
silenced by the muzzle of a revolver thrust
in his face. He dressed himself, and when
the rope was placed around his neck broke
down and wept bitterly. He was led out
of the jail at the end of the rope, placed
a spring wagon, and the procession
moved in in a northerly direction.

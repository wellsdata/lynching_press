A Case of Lynch Law in Bedford.
It appears that the citizens of Liberty, in Bed
ford county, have been aroused by one of the
startling acts of crime, with which the press of
the day is teeming, to inflict the Lynch Law up
on a free negro villian. The facts of the shock
case, as detailed to us by a correspondent.
are briefly these:
" It appeared from the statements of others
and his own confessions that he was found in bed
with two little white girls on Tuesday night af
ter they had fallen to sleep. Their father( one
of the most respectable citizens of the place)
was absent on business in this city, and there
was no grown person about the house except an
old negro woman who was sleeping in the same
room. The boy had broken in at a window, and
when discovered was lying very quietly, and apparently
asleep, between the two little girls, and
when the alarm was given by them he made his
escape. The citizens of the place on Thursday
morning.upon hearing his confessions of the fact
that he was there and for what purpose, and feel
ing, very indignant, held a meeting, in the Court
House( which was attended by nearly all the citizens
); and resolved unanimously to have the mon
ster brought forth from the jail, and publicly castrated
, which was accordingly done, in the Court
House, in the presence of the meeting. A slave
who was also somewhat implicated, was brought
out and whipped until the meeting was satisfied,
and his master notified to have him removed
from the county was within twenty days."

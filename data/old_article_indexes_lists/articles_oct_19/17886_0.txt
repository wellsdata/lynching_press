The Logic of Lynching.
ty
The lynching of a white man at
Kershaw, S. C., ought to be a warning
to the people of the south. This
is the first time that a South Carolina
white man has ever been execu-
ted by a mob, but if the lynching of
negroes is to be condoned or defended
, the lynching of white men must
follow as a matter of course.
In the end lynch law will recog-
nize neither race, coler nor previous
condition of servitude. The spirit
that brushes aside constitutional
processes will not make discrimina
tions in color.
Not the rights of the negro alone
are menaced by mob rule, but the
rights of white people as well.

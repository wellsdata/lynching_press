Public Entitled to Accounting.
Long ago this column maintained
that if any organization goes before
influence it and
the public to
solicit funds, the public has a right
to know for exactly what it is being
solicited and what becomes of the
funds. There should be public accounting
of all funds solicited from
the public, and all books of all
organizations should be open to the
income tax authorities. If the in-
come tax agent has a right and
duty to come into my office and look
through all my books, canceled
checks payroll checks, expense ac-
,
counts and receipts from contributions
to charity, why has he not
the right and duty to check the
of say, a society to discourage
books the lynching of Negroes?

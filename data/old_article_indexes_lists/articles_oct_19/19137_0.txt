Lyuching.
The Charlotte Chronicle says, referring
to the late lynching here:
" The Chronicle has believed that there
was one crime for which lynching is excusable
, but a mob does not know how
to discriminate, and this mode of violence
seems to be contagious. It is becoming
alarming. There is some fearful
disease at the core of public sentiment,
when men in passion will punish
a crime, that they will excuse or mitigate
in cold blood and deliberation. The
mob will not think and the jury is frequently
too cowardly to obey its conscience
."
The Chronicle is fast coming over to
THE CITIZEN's views on lynching. Lynching
is contagious and of course a mob
does not discriminate. For those reasons
and others we oppose it whether as
punishment for one crime or another. If
lynch law was right and mob rule judicial
where would lie the need of a criminal
court? Turn all cases over to this
judicial mob and save thousands of dol-
lars of expense. If in capital cases a mob
is always right, surely we can trust it
with the ordinary criminal calendar.
There is just one thing that will put
out of the heads of men who form these
mobs for lynching any idea of taking the
law into their own hands, and that is
swift, adequate judgment of the lynchers.
Buncombe county equal to the task?
Is We shall see.

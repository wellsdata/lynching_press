Too Common.
Two more negroes were lynched in this State
yesterday. This makes, we believe, about six
that have been strune up by mobs in the past six
months. A respectable white man who had
been accused of a crime by a woman in Alken
county came very near suffering at the hands
of a mob. The charges were later withdrawn
by the woman. What a horrible hlot upon the
State It would have been if this innocent man
had suffered. Yet if this wholesale lvnching
continues not only will some Innocent necro
bly suffer, but it is een poseble that inno.
cent white men might also. Nerer hare we
seen such a lvnchine wave sweep over the State
at pr√©sent. Te it because there is no fear of
the law? Something ought to be done to
it.- Greenville Pledmont. stop

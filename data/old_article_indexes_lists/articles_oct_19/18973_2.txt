President's Statement
The president's statement in full fol
lows:
My Fellow Countrymen:
I take the liberty of addressing
you upon a subject which so vitally
affects the honor of the nation and
the very character and integrity of
our institutions that I trust you will
think me justified in speaking very
plainly about it.
I allude to the mob spirit which
has recently here and there very frequently
shown its head amongst us,
not in any single region, but in many
and widely separated parts of the
There have been
country. many
lynchings, and every one of them
has been a blow at the heart of ordered
law and humane justice. No
man who loves America, no man
who really cares for her fame and
honor and character, or who is tru
ly loyal to her institutions, can justify
mob action while the courts of
justice are open and the governments
of the states and the nation
are ready and able to do their duty.
We are at this very moment fight
ing lawless passion. Germany has
outlawed herself among the nations,
because she has disregarded the sa
cred obligations of law and has made
lynchers of her armies. Lynchers
emulate her disgraceful example. I,
for my part, am anxious to see every
community in America rise above
that level, with pride and a fixed
resolution which man or set of
men can afford to no despise.

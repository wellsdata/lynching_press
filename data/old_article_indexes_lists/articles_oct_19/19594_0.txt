UNION COUNTY. The County Court of Union
was in session last week.
Mr J. E. Irby was
elected Clerk by the Magistrates, in place of Mr
Hough, deceased.
The people of the county appear to be a good
deal excited in consequence of the killing of Mr
Hough by a pistol shot from the hands of James
Richards, but we have no doubt, after the real circumstances
are known, all violent feeling about the
unfortunate occurrence will subside.
The state
ment last week, that Richards was arraigned be
fore the intendant, Mr Hayden, just before Hough
was shot, was erroneous, and it does not appear in
evidence that Richards had any spite against IIough
or Hayden; he never had any difficulty with either
of them- and it is believed by those fully acquaint-
ed with the evidence, that the shooting of Hough
was purely accidental, although Richards is much
blamed for carelessly handling a loaded pistol.
We make this statement as a matter of justice to
all the parties.
On Tuesday last an attempt was made to raise a
mob for the purpose of hanging Richards, but it
seems it was by a few persons unacquainted with
the particulars of the occurrence. Sheriff Austin
immediately arrested the ringleaders and prompt
ly suppressed any disturbance of the peace, in
which he was fully sustained by a large number of
citizens present. Squire Covington, Thos. S.
Ashe, Esq., and the Sheriff addressed the people,
opposing mob law and calling upon all good citizens
to assist in maintaining the laws of the State.
And we are gratified to say that on this occasion
the citizens of Union showed a determination to
sustain the authorities and put down mobs.
Richards was carried before Judge Dick on
Friday last, on a habeas corpus writ, and admitted
to bail in the sum of$ 1000, which he gave. He
was, however, held in custody on a writ for damages
at the suit of Mrs Hough. As soon as he
gives bail in this case suppose he will be re
leased. we

We are informed through a private
source that on Saturday last, the town
of Charlestown, Jefferson county, was
thrown into some excitement by a
rumor that the negroes intended to
attack the jail, and take from it George
W. Chambers, a white man confined
therein, and hang him in retaliation for
the lynching of Taliaferro, at
burg. Martins

Governor Robertson of Oklahoma
has recently denounced vikorously
the lynching of a negro at Tulsa.
But this is the same Governor Robertson
who public
gave a expression
of approval to the rotten- egging
of Senator Reed at Ardmore. Govern
or Robertson declared that Senator
Reed" got what was coming to him."
A governor who approves mob law
in the Senator
case of a guilty
of the crime of differing with
a
Democratic president, ought not to
be surprised lawlessness
spreads in his state hen.

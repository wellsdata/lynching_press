The exciting story which comes from
Dallas, Texas, of the determined effort of
a mob to break into the jail in that city in
order to lynch a negro who had killed a
policeman gains timely point from the
shocking affair at Chestertown, Maryland,

afterward proved that a white man was
the perpetrator. If no higher or stronger
argument could be advanced against lynch
law than the possibility of such frightful
blunders as this, the peril to the cause of
justice would, nevertheless, be sufficiently
obvious to all men in their cooler moments.

charge he emphasized the fact that he was
thoroughly in earnest by handing the fore
man a list of citizens who are said to have
been connected with the lynching.
The Judge's charge was a severe arraign
ment of lynching and an appeal to the people
of Mississippi to assist in breaking it up. He
pointed out that it was not only a great crime,
but frequently a great blunder, as has been
shown in Mississippi lately when the haste
of the mob in lynching prisoners had pre

The strong appeal of Judge Powell is taken
as evidence that the Judiciary of the State,
cooperating with Gov, Longino, has not
abandoned the attempt to suppress lynching
in Mississippi in spite of two failures. Gov.
Longino announced in his inaugural speech
his intention to break up lynching in Missie-
sippi. All the power of the State failed in
two cases to secure a single conviction of a
lynoher, but the last campaign at Sciardin
proved the movement to be far stronger than
at first and that public sentiment had been
well aroused on the subject.
The Terry case will show whether it is
sufficiently aroused indict and punish
lynchers. to

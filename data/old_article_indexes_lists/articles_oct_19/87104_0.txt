Henry Pickett, the remaining one of
the brothers placed in the Arkansas
penitentiary for safe keeping last fall,
died yesterday afternoon of intermittent
fever Dr. Harrison
. says however
that grief over the death of the
cther brother, Wilson Pickett, some
weeks ago, no doubt was the principal
cause of the death.
The Picketts by their death, will
save Union and Calhoun counties a
considerable expense through the removal
of a necessity for another trial
in their cases.
Since early in December 1908, the
Picketts have been a turbulent ele-
nent in South Arkansas, and Calhoun
and Union counties have been forced
to go to considerable expense to keep
the negroes from being hanged by
mobs at different times.
In a dispute over cotton, the negroes
are alleged to have opened fire
cn Bunk and Charless Abbott, prominent
planters and merchants of Cal-
houn county which resulted in the
death of Charlie Abbott, and the slight
wounding of one of the Picketts.
The negroes escaped after the
shooting and were later captured in
Monroe, La.
They were brought
back to the scene of their crime and
a mob scon formed to lynch the negroes
. The officers spirited the
Picketts away and traveled all night
on foot, reaching a railroad again early
the next morning, taking the negroes
to Pine Bluff and then Little
Rock for safe keeping.
When the Picketts were taken back
to Hampton for trial it was all the officers
could do to prevent a lynching,
and a change of venue was granted
to Union county. The had
negroes
to be spirited away again to prevent
tl.eir falling into the hands of a mob.
At El Dorado the local military company
had to be called out during the
trail of the Picketts, to prevent a
lynching. The negroes were convicted
and sentenced to serve 21 years
each in the penitentiary, but the Supreme
Court last October reversed
this decision and the men were left
in the penitentiary awaitinng the time
to come when they would receive a
new trial.
Wilson Pickett died about two
n.onths ago of fever, and Henry Pick
ett was never well after his brother
was taken to the penitentiary
yard. grave

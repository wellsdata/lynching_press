STORY OF THE CRIME
Higgins Shot Walter Copple and Wife
in Middle of the Night.
It was about midnight on Sunday,
May 12, of this year, that Louis Ray
Higgins, then going under the name
of Phillip Burke, murdered Mr. and
Mrs. Walter Copple on their farm at
Rosalie, Neb., in Thurston county.
Higgins was employed on the farm.
It was with a shotgun that
slaughtered the farmer and his Higgins wife.
He got up about midnight, took a load
ed shotgun out of doors and called
Copple. When the man appeared Higgins
poured two charges into his body.
Death was instantaneous. Copple's
wife heard the explosion and came
running out of the house, clad in night
clothing. As she left the door, Higgins
turned the smoking gun upon the wo
man whose husband he had just slain,
and shot her down like a beef.
Then the murderer tossed the bodies
of his two victims over the fence into
the hog pen, where the swine badly
mutilated the corpses.
Higgins escaped and was later
caught at Hooper. At Fremont he con-
taken to the
fessed his guilt. He was
Omaha jail for safe- keeping and his
preliminary trial was held on board
a train in Thurston county to avoid
violence. People of Pender were
quite indignant at the time over the
insinuation that any violence could occur
in this civilized age.
Higgins at Fremont said he was un
able to remember all of the details of
the crime, because he was mad from
drink when he committed it. He
would give no cause for his crime and
said he was ready to plead guilty." It
was about midnight Sunday night,"
said Higgns," that I got up and se
cured the shotgun. I do not know why
I did it. I called Copple out and then
shot him. I emptied both barrels and
may have fired four or five times af
terwards. Mrs. Copple came rushing
out and I shot her twice as she stood
on the door- step Then I went into
.
the house and stayed with the children
until 4 o'clock, when I locked the door
and went out. I took a mule from
the barn and rode seven miles down
Logan creek, where I left the animal.
I wandered over the country from that
time until I was arrested at Hooper."
Near Hooper a bridgeman who had
seen a description of Higgins saw the
,
murderer limping into town. He hurried
ahead and informed the town
marshal, who apprehended Higgins
when he arrived.
Higgins sat unmoved in the Fremont
jail while he confessed his dual crime.
He was apparently numb and sleepy
from the cold and was so stiff from
rheumatism and an injured foot that
he could hardly walk. He asked that
his mother, Cora Fay Higgins of Den
ver, be notified. She later came to
Omaha to see him.
Higgins that Copple had
given him whisky claimed.

CONFLICT FIERCE AND FATAL A
AND LYNCHING.
Louisville, March 10.- A special from Grogson,
Ky., says: Another calamity took place th Up
per Big Sinking Creek, Carter county, last night.
A party of regulators, consisting of one hundred
citizens, rode to James Bincen's house and asked
for John Boggs, quite a notorious character, who
was concealed about the house. Bip cen refused
to open the door but commenced a fusilade on
the regulators, firing 50 shots, and killing, it is
believed, one of them. This enraged the regulators
, who had come mostly to notify Boggs to
leave the country, and in their rage they broke
down the doors of the house. It is thought three
shots were flied at Bincen who was instantly
killed. A rock thrown at the door to break it
down hit Bincen's wife and broke her right leg.
Thereupon the regulators seized John Boggs and
after a short trial took him to a walnut tree
standing 15 steps from the house, where they
hung him with a cotton rope and then fired two
shots at him, one penetrating his body and the
other piercing his hand. In this condition Boggs
was found this morning by Dr. Steel, who cut
the rope and took his corpse to Boggs' family. A
nineteen- year old son of Bincen's was taken out
and whipped by the for having join.
ed the fusilade against regulators them.

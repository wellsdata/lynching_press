A party of men on the night of the 13th entered
town, and, under cover of the night, proceeded to
, the jail, where they bound the watchman and after
wards released two of the prisoners who were con
fined as guilty of treason in the Cortina war. The
act was so quietly done that it was not known to
on half the citizens next day, and the question now
is, were the prisoners released by their friends or
were they taken out by a mob and hung? I can
not answer the question yet
at.

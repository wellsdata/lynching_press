LYNCHERS HUNT
NEGRO IN TEXAS
HOUSTON, Texas, July 17.
Uniformed and bossmen lynch gangs
are raking Houston and vicinity,
seeking an unarmed Negro worker
who, half starved from lack of employment
, sought relief at the home
of a wealthy merchant this morning.
The wife of the merchant accuses
the Negro worker of robbing and
attacking her.
The police officials have arranged
with the merchant to have the Ne
gro worker legally lynched if not
burned as John Hughes was at
Sherman, Texas, or as William
Rainey was at Beaumont.
Four Negro workers have been
lynched in this state within the last
seven months. One Negro worker,
Jesse Washington, is being held in
a state prison in Oklahoma, after
a mob failed to get him in Sham
rock, Texas, last Saturday. More
than 50 Negro workers and their
families were driven from Sham
rock. A large number of Negro
were forced to flee from
workers Erick, Oklahoma, last Monday.

FRANK HOWE IS DEAD,
Breathed His Last At
6:05 This Morn
ing.
THUS THE SHOOTING IN THE
CHINESE RESTAURANT
CLUMINATES IN
MURDER.
A Special Grand Jury Summoned
To Indiet Wiley Goode,
the Murderer.
Poor Frank Howe is dead.
He died at the Infirmary at 6
o'clock and 5 minutes this morning.
Thus, Friday's shooting in the
Chinese restaurant has cluminated
in murder.
An Innocent man, in the prime of
his young manhood, while eating a
quiet meal in a public restaurant,
has been robbed of his life by a
ruthless ruffian.
Wiley Goode, a notrious character
who has engaged in many shooting
affrays in this community, is the
author of the murder, and he now
languishes in jail. Today Judge
Elliott ordered a special grand jury
to investigate the case, and Sheriff
Triplett has been out this
morning summonsing grand
jurymen to assemble at 9
o'clock Tuesday morning for that
purpose. The Sheriff has summoned
only good citizens to serve on this
grand jury, and before tomorrow
night Wiley Goode will stand in-
dicted for murder in the first degree.
On the streets today there has been
some talk of lynch law, but that is
the sheerest folly. Ourjail is strong and
invulnerable, and Sheriff Triplett a
brave and fearless officer, and what
is the use of talking about a mob
to lynch this worthless wretch,
Goode, when it is likely to cost the
lives of a number of good citizens?
We have law in this land and public
officers who will do their duty and
enforce the law, and Wiley Goode
will be speedily prosecuted and
brought to justice. His escape
from his iron cage is impossible, and
a jury of citizens of Jefferson County
will try the case and mete out
justice. We can rely upon our
officers and juries composed of our
fellow citizens to enforce the law;
therefore away with this irrational,
lawless and death- dealing talk of
mob violence.
Frank Howe's remains were
turned over to undertaker Robinson
this morning, and the undertaker
is now awaiting instructions from
Howe's relatives in New Hampshire,
who were notified by wire this
morning, to know what disposition
to make of the remains.
LATER- At 2 o'clock this afternoon
Undertaker Robinson received a
dispatch from Frank Howe's sister
instructing him to embalm the re
mains and ship them to his home at
Laconia, New Hampshire, for inter
ment. Howe's remains will, there
fore, be shipped tonight
CORONATION OF THE. CZAR.

The Sensation of Hanging.
Lord Ponsonby, who was hanged by
a mob in Paris in 1791 and cut down
before life was extinct, proceeded to
give an account of his sensations on re
turning to consciousness. He could
not have actually been suspended in
mid air more than a few seconds, and
yet in that brief space of time all the
events of his past life passed through
his mind.
It is true that his life up to
that date had not been a very event
ful one, being only 19 years of age;
but every past sensation was renewed
in all its freshness. It is also remark
able that he did not at the time experience
any sensation of fear; while,
he added, his was an essentially ner
vous temperament. This remarkable
mental power of calling up the past in
moments of suspended animation I
have heard frequently mentioned.
One was the case of Count Zichy, in
the revolution of 1848, in Vienna. He
was caught by the savage mob, hung
like Lord Ponsonby in the middle of
the street, when his own regiment of
dragoons charged down and cut the
cords as he was swinging in the air.
He fell to the ground and was supposed
to be dead; but his recovery was a
very different matter from Lord Pon
sonby's, for he suffered agonies, and
for ten days had four men constantly
with him. He described exactly the
same sensations as Lord Ponsonby;
the scroll of what was a much longer
life was unrolled, even the smallest
detail rushed back on his memory; he
had the same fearlessness at the mo
ment, but he felt all the horror of the
agony when the danger was
Blackwood's. past.

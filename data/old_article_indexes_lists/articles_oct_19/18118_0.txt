Negroes Lynched.
The strike resulted in numerous
clashes between strike sympathizers
and the police in Chicago, and
in the lynching of negro strike
breakers at Fort Worth, Texas, and
Oklahoma City, Okla. Yesterday,
at Oklahoma City, five men, three
white and two negroes, were sentenced
to life imprisonment for
their part in the lynching of
Brooks, a negro strike- breaker Jake.

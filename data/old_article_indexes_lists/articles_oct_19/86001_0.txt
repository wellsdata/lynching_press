THE BARDWELL LYNCHING.
The Mob Mutilating and Burning the
Dead Body.
BARDWELL, Ky, July 7.- At 3:20
o'clock the negro Milier was brought
from the jail to the principal street
with a chain around his neck and
many men pulling at it. The crowd
was wild, and no one could guess at
the fate of the negro. He was almost
suffocated when the norih end of the
depot was reached, and the father of
the girls relented to some extent and
suggested that he be hanged
than burned. rather

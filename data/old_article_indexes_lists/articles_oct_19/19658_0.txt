Richardson got down, and taking
the horses by the head, led them into

The officer obeyed.

Then Atchison was ordered to get
down and was placed under guard.
The negro prisoners, divining the
purpose of the mob, attempted to leap
from the wagon. A volley rang out
from forty or fifty guns and they fell
back, wounded and dying. A dozen
of the mob leaped into the wagon and

shot from his body.
The mob, after making sure that
or all six were dead, mounted and rode
away. Atchison then mounted one
- mule and hastened to justice Hill's
house, some distance away, and notified
him of the slaughter. The justice
at once made ready to go to the spot,
and at daybreak was there with a jury
of inquest, composed of five white
men and two negroes. The jury ren

Nogro Burning The Mobile Register of June
1st gives, on the authority of The Linden Jeffersonian
, the particulars of a negro- burning- one
of those awfully barbarous punishments which
must take place so long as two hundred thousand
people claim to own four millions as chattles and
cattle:
Negro Burned- A gentleman just from Gaston,
Samter county, informs us, says the Linden Jeffersonian
, that the negro boy that murdered Missed
Thornton, near Gaston, a few weeks since, was
on last Friday burned to death on the same spot
where he perpetrated the horrible deed. Failing
to procure a jury for his trial from among the
indignant citizens of Sumter, the venue had been
changed to Greene. Learning these facts, a large
number of citizens repaired to the jail of Sumter,
got the boy out, and carried him to the spot as
mentioned above, and burned him in the presence
of a large crowd of persons assembled to
the execution. witness

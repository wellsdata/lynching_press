Day had fled to the woods, but was
captured next morning by the constable.
A mob gathered to lynch Day, but the
Constable took his prisoner over the river
into Clarke county and brought him by
a circuitous route to Kalama, where he
is now lodged in jail. Great indignation
prevails throughout that section, and it
is feared that Day will be lynched,
Day's son, who had caused the difficulty
, remarked when he heard that his
father had killed Beebe;" Oh, that's
nothing. It the first time pap has
done the like isn't."

MOB LYNCHES
NINE NECROES
Race War in Texas Fatal to the
Blacks- Strugle Started in
Murder.
a
TOOK PRISONERS FROM JAIL
Houston, Tex., June 23.- Nine negroes
have been killed in a race war in
Sabine county, and an organized band
of 150 whites has defied the authorities
and threatened to exterminate the
blacks if there is any attempt at reprisal
. Five of the negroes were
hanged from the limb of a tree, and
four were shot. The bodies of two
were thrown into a ditch. The body of
another was carried and left at the
gate of a man he had threatened. The
entire negro population is in a state of
terror, and many hundreds have fled
the county.
The outbreak is the worst in the history
of the state and had its start with
the murder of Hugh Dean, a prosperous
young farmer, two weeks ago.
Dean was killed in a negro church.
Prohibition is the law in Sabine county
, but there are negroes who sell
liquor under cover of the church. Dean
had gone to the church to buy whisky,
and a full bottle was found in his
hand. There was a crowded congregation
, and the man was shot down in
the aisle. The men and women filled
out and did not make known the murder
. A searching party found the body
the following morning.
Six Negroes Taken From Jail.
An investigation was begun, and on
the testimony of several blacks that
the murder had been plotted in a
schoolhouse, a hundred yards from
the church, Frank Williams, Jerry Evans
, Will Johnson, Mose Spellman,
Clever Williams and Will Manuel were
arrested and locked in the county jail
in Hemphill. Strong testimony was
given against the men at a preliminary
hearing, and at a secret meeting of the
whites on Friday night it was decided
to lynch the six men.
A few of the whites held out against
lynching, but their objections were re-
moved by the murder of Aaron M.
Johnson, a young white farmer, early
Saturday night. He was playing with
his children and was killed with a bullet
through the window. This crime
drove the whites to a frenzy of rage,
and it was with difficulty many were
restrained from at once attacking the
blacks. Finally it was decided to car
ry out the plan agreed upon at the
secret meeting on Friday night and
,
as a first step the six men in jail
the killing of Dean were lynched. for
When the mob appeared outside the
county jail the leader knocked on the
door of the jail with the butt of his
rifle. The Jaller said he would shoot
and was told he would be" strung up"
with the prisoners. Then he opened
the door and turned over the keys to
the cells. It took only a few minutes
to march out the six condemned men.
One Man Tries to Escape.
They were walked to the place for
the execution with ropes around their
necks. The mob caught them in a circle
, and there was little excitement, ex
cept on the part of the victims. They
cursed and prayed alternately and also
kept asserting they were innocent.
When any one of them dropped back
or hesitated in the march he was driven
forward at the muzzle of a leveled
rifle. Only a half dozen men who
went into the jail wore masks.
The six negroes were stood in line
below a thiek limb reaching almost
across the road a mile from the jail.
It had been planned to string them up
all together. Six ropes had been thrown
over the limb, and groups of men were
ready to swing the negroes off their
feet. Just when the order was given
to tighten the ropes Frank Williams
made a break for liberty. The mob
was so sure of itself that the negroes
had gone untied.
Williams quickly slipped off the
noose and before any one could interfere
was headed for the village. Several
of the mob started in pursuit, but
were stopped by the shots of their
they fellows, who killed Williams.

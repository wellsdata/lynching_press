MOB LAW IS SO EASY
Attempt to Hang a Man for Alleged Dis
honest Practices.
Marion, Ind., Sept. 29.- Frank Stech
er, a former Chicago attorney, who re
moved recently to Van Buren, was
threatened with lynching by a mob
of 400 infuriated oil workers and oth
er citizens and the officers barely succeeded
in saving his life. As it was
he was badly hart. He was struck in
the back with a stone and it is thought
his spine is injured. Stecher aroused
the enmity of the people of Van Buren
,
it is alleged, by questionable practices.
The affair which caused the popular
feeling to reach a climax and
nearly ended in the attorney's death
by mob violence was the collection of
a note for John Blair, a feeble- mind
ed boy. Stecher refused to give the
boy the money when he demanded it.
A committee called on the lawyer and
demanded a settlement. Stecher gave
the boy$ 10, but the citizens refused
to allow the boy to be imposed on
formed a mob to lynch Stecher. and

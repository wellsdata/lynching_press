Booker T. Washington's Plan.
Boston, Nov. 24.- Booker T. Washington
said last night regarding the re
cent lynching of a negro in Colorado
that the same class of people who be
gan to break the law by lynching a
negro will soon learn to break the law
by lynching a white man.
" I think," said Mr. Washington,
" that the Colorado lynching emphasizes
the fact that the only way to stop such
outbreaks is, in the first place, to bring
about such general education, not only
in books, but in industry and thrift,
as will make odious such acts as that
which provoked the lynching fever, and
then to educate public sentiment up to
the point where people of all parts of
the country will see that we only can
have the highest civilization if the law
is enforced regardless of race or color.
" Wherever people begin to lynch for
one kind of offense they are soon led
into the temptation of lynching for
any other kind of offense. Aside from
the injustice that is perpetrated upon
the individual put to death without a
legal trial, we must bear in mind that
there is a permanent degradation
which comes to the individual who
takes part in and witnesses such
outrage as occurred in Colorado." an

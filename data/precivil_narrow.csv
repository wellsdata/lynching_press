Norther.ers generally, in the South, and


confirming the atrocious murder otthe three

intensity Of mingled fea. and hate and
madness, which pervade community

! will now give YOU brief history OF the
, causes that isd me to come to this place,
and will in the first place state briefly that
it was to save my life.


There is a reign of terror in New Or
| leans, AZ vel as in the whole South. A
Northern man holds his life in his hands
after getting below Memphis, but nothing
to what it is below there.


After getting as far as Vicksburg a Nor
.hern nan is abused on The smallest pre-
tense imaslnpbi and if there is fire
d gin house or other building burnt, from
any cause whatever, the cry is raised that
it is the work of an abolitionlst, and wo

neig ghborhood.


If he escapes being hung he will be shay
s,i on the head, and branded on his cheek
or forehead or # the punishment is meant
to bs light, he may be tarred and feather
ed rode on rail, and then started to the
nearest place To a steamboat or the cars,
,being abused all the way and started
North on deck passage, and if he has no
money, to depend 90 the charity of those
ne may happen 10 be with to keep from
starving


This is no overdrswu picture. but does
not picture half t!.e enormiIies prac-iced by
the chiyalry Of the south.


There have been scores Of men lynched
and hung III the South from no other cause
that being Northern Republicans.


Although other charges, such as e2ci,
.ng slaves, and giving them poison and
atins aud ammunition to kill their masters |.
with are trumped up against them.


The matter of hanging three men az Fri I
ar'S Point you have DO doubt seen in the /,
papers also a denial of it afterwards by !
The Southern press, as also that the letter |
porporting to be written by Halle giving |
the account ot it xhS q forgery. |


But / tell YUu ,Iat il j., verify believe,
y fact that those SITre men were hung IL

Ike The Others. /,


You don't hear uf one case in f!fty that |
is perpetratcd,


The policy Of the press in the South is
70 Suppress tbc publication Of these things
snd when they are published it is the ex,
cep,ion rather than ;he rule.


1t is truly horrible state o! affairs In
New Orleans there is not even an alluson
made to what has been done there, and
yet can furnish proof If ;ny statement is
doubted, that there were, the week before
left, six men hung for being abo,itionsts,
as all Republicans are called, in the city Of
New Orleans.


There have been ssen without limit driv-
en- from the city by the vigilance committee,
so styled.


a,n, or rather, was informed while in |
New Orleans that the course taken bY those

The Usual lm.t Is twenty four hours,
and it was On request Of that kind that |
le.t-choosiug to leave rather than run the
risk of being taken o'lt the next night and
hung TO lamp post.


Yoa may thi'E such things strange but
nevertheless Thy are true, | could not
write 70 you to warn you not to write me
anything politically; that would compro-
mise me, fearing that the letter would be
opened and read. thereby preoiptating the
very thing vas anxious to avoid Bu.
am thankful that your own good seaae g1i-
ded you in the matter and that you avoided
all things Of the kind.


There we're several o: my letters opened,
some OF them we're rcsealed and some had
written on the envelope ''opened By mis-

Don't it seem hard that such things should
exist in this country? Yet such is the
case.

The following evidence Of Mr.. Kleine sets
forth the merits of the case more fully than
we can otherwise detail them, he being the
District Attorney at the date of the alleged
murder, and having interested himself to
learn the facts. Mr.. Kleine being sworn,
said


Invent to Bangor on or about the 10Th of
March last | went there with Mr.. Freer
aud deputy sheriff Mclaughlin. | saw de-
defendant there. He came over from there
to Oroville in a buggy with myself and MIR
Freer He talked with us about the hang
ing of the three men on the previous night
lie told us that he had gone to Bangor in
company with the men hung They arrived
there late in the afternoon, and stopped at a
cabin on the outskirts Of the town One of
the party went into town for provisions,
after which proposition was made to rob
Chinese camp. They planned the attack,
and about 8 o'clock they went to the camp
1t was arranged that defendant should stand
guard while the others committed the
robbery. The three then went toward the
cabin one of them knocked at the door; it
was opened by a Chinamhn; soon after the
door was opened n shot was fired, (probably
by the Chinaman) after which two othsr
other shots followed, (these we're fired by the
robbers) Immediately after the firing they
all retreated One of the party remarked
shots. They all started for the Oregon
House, from where they went to the Yuba
river, in the vicinity of which the party was
arrested, and taken to Bangor, where, pend
ing an examination before magistrate they
were all taken out by the mob to be hung
When at the tree, the other robbers had told
the crowd that defendant was innocent of
murder, whereupon he was released.

telegraph has given assurance for nearly
a week that the attempt of the assassin
had failed to accomplish its object, and
that he who had been singled out as a
victim, would be spared to his family,
to his friends, and to scourge from pub
lie sight the rascality and corruption
that had appropriated our young State
to its own purposes. But e'er week
had elapsed, the telegraph again vibrates
with the sad intelligence of his death,
and the important announcement that
MS assassin was in the hands of a vigi-
lance committee and would be summarIly
dealt with.


We are not the advocate or the apol-
ogist of Lynch law. We sho uld rather
see men render their influence and ser
vice to sustain the laws, by devoting an
occasional day in the capacity of jurors,
than forming vigilance committees, and
taking even the blAckest # criminals
from the hands of the law. We are not
yet prepared to make so dangerous and
improper use IF the press, as to rec
ommend the application Of the fearful
code. There is no assassination so ma
lignant, no crime so bold, but the law
properly and fearlessly administered,
will reach it. The proper administra-
tion depends upon the people. Who
amongst US is prepared to set aside the
guarantees of the constitution under
which we live; Are we prepared to
admit by taking the law into our own
hands, that our system of government
has failed, and that the ballot-box is no
longer the bulwark Of our freedom ?


1t is true that in the present case the
assumption by the psople of the most
solemn responsibilities, although it can
not be justified, is extenuated by Sc
ries of wrongs, expressions and spolia
tions, unparalleled in the history of So
ciety in the U. S. Outrages the most
gross have been unblushingly perpetra-
ted in open daylight, and in the face Of
the constituted authorities. San Fran
cisco has been the scene OF a thousand
homicides, and of but two convictions
by due process of law Professional
gamblers and hardened villains have shot
down respectable men with impunity,
and the courts have failed to convict,
either through their own corruption or
ineficiency. The talents of ex-Con-
grsSsmen, Iured by the money of prosti-
tates, has been exerted in defence of
assassins, gamblers and thieves. No
one, however disreputable his character
could be convicted if he had money with
which to defend himself. This state of
things has forced upon the people of
San Francisco the necessity Of action
Either the courts were corrupt to the
core, or the city was filed with organ
lied bands of villains, whose false oaths
turned aside the course of Justice and
permitted the assassin to parade the
public thoroughfares with impunity.
The gambler Cora shoots down General
Richardson, IN the broad light of day. in
the public street, and the courts fail to
convict. Enboldened by such failure,
Casey, former inmate of the Sing Sing
States Prison, assassinates Mr.. King,
who occupies prominent and enviable
position in public estima ton. The
people fsel-they hAoao-from long ex-
perience, that the courts fail to meet out


the punishment prescribed by law, aud
they organize, and mete out justice in
an unlawful manner. The people OF
San Francisco, in their sovereign capac-
ity, have stripped the mask of sanctity
from its corrupt ard Intfs cive judici-
arv,and have held it up to tie scorn and
contempt of the world They have in-
formed the organized bands Of assassins
who have fastened themselves upon their
city that, although they may have their
associates interspcrsed through every
ramification of COVE, ament, and although
they may bribe all the lawyers of the
State to espouse their unGoly cause,
there is a ""power behind the throne,
greater than the throne ITSELF"" that de-
clares in terms not to be misunderstood,
that the moral sense of community is no
longer to be shocked--that ''Whoso
shcddeth mans blood, by man shall his
blood be she'd"" The history of San
Francisco furnishes much in extcnuation
of this uprising of her people Let us
hope that it may have the effect 10 ren.

 The sheriff had, so far succeeded in main- taining the law, and in protecting the prisoners, but it was deemed very doubtful whether the passions of the multitude could be stayed last night. We shall not be surprised to learn that still further violence had been perpetrated.

 The same paper of the 18th has the follow ing.

 We recounted in our issue of yesterday the tragedy enacted near Marion, Crittenden county Arkansas, and probability that the mob would have recourse to lynch law. We learn from Esq Spain, of Hope6eld that the mob made an attack upon the jail last evening, with crow. bars and pick axes, and having forced an en. trance, man named Jenkins, Cousin of the murdered man, discharged the contents of two pistols and shot gun into the cell (through tbe bars) where D. Hendricks the man charged with the commission of the murder, was con hned-without effect, however. The door of the prisoners cell was then forced, and Dr. Blair, represented as leader of the crowd, was knocked senseless by Hendricks, who, armed with a piece of scantling inflicted a wound upon his head four or five inches in lenoth Hendricks was taken from his cell and led tn the edge of the woods near the lake, where ha was told that he only had five minutes to live and to make his peace with his Maker. Mr. H.s wife clunS to him, and appealed to those in the mob who appeared intent upon depriving her husband of life, to give him a fair trial by jury of his countrymen. She said, ["" the court of Crittenden county will meet on the secold Monday of May, when you can try my hus band for the crime of murder, and if you can convict him by the evidence which will be ad duced, hang him."" Mrs. H.'s appeal had it's effect upon the group assembled and her hus band was taken back to jail, where yesterday, at three o'clock, he remained

 John Garrett, formerly resident of this city, was on trial yesterday afternoon, before Esq, Peeler, of Marion, as an accessory to the murder, and we learn that strong evidence was produced to criminate him.

 There were fears entertained that another at tack would be made upon the jai and that both Hendricks and Garrett would be summarv dealt with by the enraged populace.

 Mr. Jenkins, the murdered man, was one of the most respec able citizens of Crittenden county, and the deepest regret and indignation is felt at his sudden and bloody death MT. J leaves wife and daughter to mourn his me- lancholy fate, besides host of other relations and friends. We expect to give further part- cuars of this sad affair

fred Buchanan, the young man arrested at a
village on the Erie railroad, on Monday,
charged with the murder Of Mrs. Shancks, was
brought back to New York on Thursday, in
custody. On his arrival, he was met by large
and excited crowd, who threatened to lynch
him on the spot, but the officers succeeded in
conveying him safely to prison. He is said to
be the youngest son of a very respectable fam.
lily Of New York. Though he makes no direct
confession, he admits that he knew the murder
ed woman, and that he was drunk the morning
the crime was committed. There are several
cuts and bruises on his hands and wrists, as if
made by broken glass bottles. This is sig.
ni6cant circumstance, inasmuch as the floor Of
the room where Mrs. b. was killed was strewn
with the remains Of broken glass bottles. Glass
was also found in the crushed portion Of the
sknll. The clothes of the prisoner are also
stained with blood.


Buchanan is but nineteen years Of age. His
eye hos a wild and glittering stare, and all his
movements are restless. His father, who keeps
a carpenters shop, corner of Broadway and
Twelfth streets, states that his son has been
long subject to fits, and that he was once in
the Lunatic Asylum. The prisoner says he

First Iieut. Eulrinet","","LYNCHING IN SHELBYyILE, ILLINols.-A Nan
Taken from The Jail and Hung.-0n Tuesday
morning last our usually quiet community was
thrown into intense excitement by the discovery
that the jail had been broken open, and prisoner
Columbus Nutterfield-was missing. Immediate
search was made by our citizens, and he was found
suspended to tree little east of the town, dead.
Justice Oliver Immediately summoned Coroner's
Jury, who took down and examined the body and
returned the following verdict:


""It is the opinion of the jury, from the evidence
received, that the deceased came to his death by
violence, and that by hanging, by persons unknown
to the jury


The following paper was found upon the body,
placed inside his waistband - evidently written
in disguised hand--and which we present ue5'-
batim:


""a Word to the Wise


and espesilay to the


Horse thieves


We the Vigilence Committy Of Shelby Co 1lls
do here by declare to avoid troblin our Courts
- MANY GITIzENs.n


Mr. Nutterfeld, it seems, was under arrest for
stealing horses from VIM Mddlesworth of this
county, and had been confined in our jail awaiting
trial since November last. By his evidence before
a vigilance committee, soon after, obtained by
threats of violence and hanging, he implicated +.
W. Bacon, Of Princeton, ILL.,, who was also arrest
ed; and upon his (A.'s} evidence at the trial of
Bacon, in Macon county, in July last, he cleared
Baeon-clearly showing that he swore falsely be-
fore the committee. Nutterfield had in ALL stolen
four horses from Mr. Middlesworth, and in attempt
ing to steal two more he was shot at and wounded
but managed to escape and was at large until his
arrest last fall, as stated above. In his confession
before the aforesaid committee, he gave nforma-
ton where the horses could be found, and we be-
lieve three of them were recovered


By whom he was lynched, of course, is unknown
except to the perpetrators and we are authorized
to state that citizens in and around Shelbyville
regard the act as an atrocity against our coInmn-
nifty and against humanity-that they believe Nut
entitled to fra by our courts and beays W. ths
law would have convicted him of his crime.


The deceased we understand, belonged in BID
reau connty-whether this be SO, or whether Nut
tertield was his real name, or not we cannot say.
He was about Is years of age.

from Col. Whitman to his son, dated June

1t showed all day June lst, at Virginia

of discoveries. The town was growing
senSibly duller. Many were leaving and Indi
an troubles deferred people from coming in.
Provisions high and scarce. A vigilance
committee was about organizing to lynch
a butcher, but it was promptly nipped In
the bud.


In reference to the war the Colonel SAYS,
unless help in the way of provisions etc. is
furnished by California the volunteers must
disband and the whole fighting given up to
two hundred regulars on foot, in which
event he fears depopulation of the Terri
tory, as the signs of long and bloody war
are imminent. Unless the American troops
can meet the savages in few DAYS and
give them severe lesson in a great battle,
the worst is anticipated When leaving
Virginia City, Col Hays told his troops
that unless they were willing to live on
meat for some time, the road was open to
to Carson City and they were at liberty to
take it. Not man left.


great battle was expected to come off
on Sunday last. The Col says Nevada
and Sierra came nobly to the relief of their
brethren IN Utah; Sacramento did some

MURDER AND Lynch Law IN MIssIssIrpl.-
The Natchez Courier of the 18th inst. contains
the particulars OF an atrociOus murder in Jeiicr-
son county, Miss. with the summary execution
Of two of the murdcrers. 1t seems that Il MIR.
VIM Boyd, planter living near Torry's store,
was about to correct one of his negroes for some
offence, when the fellow turned upon his mas.
ter and was about TO overpower him. The
latter called upon two negro women, who were
at work IN the same field, for assistance but IN
stead of helping they fell upon him with their
hoes and soon put him to death. The three ne
groes sccrcted the body of Alr. b., in a brush
heap bat in two days time 1t beginning 10
smell they removed it to log pile, sci every
thing on fire, and burnt the body TO ashes
The negroes, suspecting that the absence Of
their master would soon be known, assumed
boldness enough to tell some of the neighbors
that Mr.. b., had been absent for some days
that his horse had come up saddled, bridled
&c. and that they suspected foul play. a
search was Immediately instituted by the neigh
bors, and after some time they came upon the
spot in the field where the combat had takel
place between MIR. Boyd and the negroes. One
thing led to another until the negroes were al
arrested, when they acknowledged their crime
as stated above. The excitement among tn,
people assembled was very great. About ONT
hundred persons were collected on Friday last
3lst ut. one week from the DAY of the murder
They appointed jury OF eighteen men to decide
what should be Zone with the negroes. -Four
teen of the jury were for hanging the negroes
and four against II. Two OF the negroes, thc
man and one of the women, were hung in
stantly. The other woman, being pregnan,
was spared.","iiisourmelancholydutyrecordthedemiseofthreeotthemostprominentcitizensofouroatrtimothydwightmrlrhiellowsanddirnathanielterrytheirdeathswerealmostsimultaneousoccurringthinlewhoursoileachotherandwillmakelastingimpressiononourcommunitymrdwightwasasonoithelatepreldenidwightofiulecollegeandhaslongbeenoneofourmostvaluableandrespectedcltzensmirtownistheweiknownarchitectofmanyofourpublicstructuresandalsoottheinnewyorkwhichcityhasbeenhisprincipalresdenceforseveralyearsmrterryhadbeenonavisittohissoninthiscityandbatfewdayssincewaswalkinginourstreetsillhisusualhealthliehasfilledmanyeminentstationsinpubliciiieandwashighlyrespecteduscitizenandcivilianmurderandlynchlawinmississirplthenatchezcourierofthethinstcontainstheparticularsofanatrociousmurderinjeiicrsoncountymisswiththesummaryexecutionoftwoofthemurdcrerstseemsthatilmirvimboydplanterlivingneartorrysstorewasabouttocorrectoneofhisnegroesforsomeoffencewhenthefellowturneduponhismasterandwasabouttooverpowerhimthelattercalledupontwonegrowomenwhowereatworkinthesamefieldforassistancebutinsteadofhelpingtheyfelluponhimwiththeirhoesandsoonputhimtodeaththethreenegroessccrctedthebodyofalrbinabrushheapbatintwodaystimetbeginningsmelltheyremovedittologpilescieverythingonfireandburntthebodytoashesthenegroessuspectingthattheabsenceoftheirmasterwouldsoonbeknownassumedboldnessenoughtotellsomeoftheneighborsthatmrbhadbeenabsentforsomedaysthathishorsehadcomeupsaddledbridledcandthattheysuspectedfoulplayasearchwasimmediatelyinstitutedbytheneighborsandaftersometimetheycameuponthespotinthefieldwherethecombathadtakelplacebetweenmirboydandthenegroesonethingledtoanotheruntilthenegroeswerealarrestedwhentheyacknowledgedtheircrimeasstatedabovetheexcitementamongtnpeopleassembledwasverygreataboutonthundredpersonswerecollectedonfridaylastlstutoneweekfromthedayofthemurdertheyappointedjuryofeighteenmentodecidewhatshouldbezonewiththenegroesfourteenofthejurywereforhangingthenegroesandfouragainstiitwoofthenegroesthcmanandoneofthewomenwerehunginstantlytheotherwomanbeingpregnanwasspared",<chr>,9035,"sn83030213",1844-06-17,1844,"New York","New-York daily tribune.

 The steamship Empire City, arrived at New Orleans on the 12th inst We gather the fol- lowing items of news from the New Orleans pa- pers of the 18th inst:

 State Items.

 The steamer Sea Bird arrived on the Sd inst, from Los Angeles, bringing intelligence of new ly discovered placer diggings, located about five miles beyond the Tejon upon the river Possi- uncua. The yield is from $4 to $25 per day, to the man.

 Capt. Harry Love, we'll known as the captur- CT of the celebrated robber, Joaquin, was mar lied on the 31st of May last, to Mrs. Mary Ben nett, of Santa Clara.

 The result of the election for Congressmen and State officers, which took place on the 9th inst, has been another democratic victory. The returns render 1t certain that Messrs. Denver & Herbert, the Anti Frederick candidate for Con- gresS, have trumphed by handsome maiorities There will be also a clear majority in both branches of the next Legislature. Joseph R. Beard, the whig candidate, is, however, elected Clerk of the Supreme Court.

 By the arrival of the Southerner on the 4th nst from San Diego we have the particulars ot desperate affray at Monterey, resulting in the death of an American and the lynching of na- tive Californian. The American was a peace off. cer named William Hardmouth. He was at tempting to arrest the Californian for disorderly conduct in dance house, when he resisted, and finally shot him in the abdomen with buckshot. The Californian was afterwards dragged from his bed by mob, and hung from the caves of the house in which he had committed the mur- der.

 Southern California. New diggings have been discovered and are yielding finely.

 The Los Angeles Star says:

 Mr. $. Kaufman, of the firm of H. Mayer & Co.,. for some time engaged in the Santa Fe and Chihuahua trade, arrived from Fl Paso last week, with twenty large Chihuahua wagons and about 300 mules, the largest and finest train that ever before arrived in this valley The train left Ell Paso on the 12th of June, being including stoppages, about two months and a half on the route. MT. K. reports the Apaches very hostile, committing depredations whenever and wherever an opportunity offered. On the Rio San Pedro the Indians killed MT. Whit hey, partner of Madison & Co.,, with large drove of cattle for this country, and their ma jor- domo, by the name of Edwards. Messrs. Whit ney and Edwards were in pursuit of some cat tie about a mile ln the rear of the train when they were surprised by large party of Indians and shot with rifles. There was also another man badly wounded, but succeeded in making his escape, and is now recovering. The feed for stock was very good from Fl Paso to Tuson, but from the latter place until they arrived at Warmers ranche the feed was very poor, SC much so that it was a matter of surprise that 1iuo crossed the Rio Colorado at the new ferry known as the Pilot Knob Ferry, and speak in the high est praise of Messrs Mclean, Little & Arm. strong, the proprietors, for their gentlemanly attention and quick dispatch they received 1T crossing the river The following gentlemen all with large drovcs of cattle, from San Anto nio, Texas, were encamped near Tuson, wait ing for better feed on the Gila river: Messrs Pyron Edwards, Fully, Sweet, & Co. The weather was extremely hot, and there was nc rain on the route after leaving Tuson.

 From Oregon--More Indian Massacres.

 The Oregonian says: We are indebted to Stewards Express for the following information n relation to the murder of eight American emigrants, and the capture and carrying of oi four women and several children by the Snake Indians. An express had arrived at the Dalles with the startling intelligence that few days since, an immigrant train, consisting of four wa gons, eight men, four women, boy of l2 years old, and several small children, were attacked b6y sixty Indians, about fifteen miles beyond Fort Boise The men were all killed, the boy badly wounded, and the women, children, stock and property carried off John F. Noble, Esq. formerly of Vancouver, found the wounded boy and the bodies of the killed. He immediately came on to Fort Boise, whereupon MT. Frui started tor the Dalles with the information, anc 10 get assistance to, if possible, recapture the women and children. Gov Gaines, who wal at or near Fort Boise, awaiting the arrival O ms sons, who are coming across the plains, ral iied some fifteen men and started in pursuit o tne Indians, determined to overtake and pun !sn M these murderers and recover the prisoners we also learn that all the disposable troops al 'ne Dalles were immediately mounted and de. sSPatched to Fort Boise, and that company Jeff vancouver on the steamer Belle, on Thursday nnl,ofhlng, n, for the same point Also, that Nathan 0Oliiey had raised some twenty volunteers at the Dailes, and had gone after the murderers.

ERN SAVAGES.","","ERN sAvAGEs.


In excited times, weak men become foo Is,
and eviLdisposed men williams. The first be-
come the victims of the last. Fanaticism
seizes upon both, and what in one case becomes
folly, in the other case becomes crime. Both
are rendered furious and frantic. Whenever
any question arises in this country that involves
the subject of slavery, the abolitionists and
agitators seize hold of it with blind passion,
and run entirely mad with fanaticism. They
claim that their great object is philanthropy,
and to promote that object they think that they
are released from all the obligations Of honor
and Of common truthfulness. Like all fanatics,
they believe, or affect to believe that the end
ustifes the means;"" that they may do wrong
in order that good may come of it. One of
their favorite modes of exciting the members
of their vile and pestilent crew is to strike off
and circulate pictures of slaves in chains, on
the gallows, under the lash, or in consuming
flames. Another is to coin, rake up, print and
circulate heartrending accounts of the barba-
rous cruelty of masters to slaves Children at
the north are thus taught to abhor the south,
women are impressed with the same prejudice,
and ignorent men who read nothing but what
is brought to, and forced on them, catch the
same feeling.


In the whole north, there is no more danger
Gus, unscrupulous and virulent enemy to the
peace of this country, to the institutions OF
this country, to the Constitution of this coun-
try, than that talented, but disorganiz;ng and
crazy journal, the New York Tribune 1t is
thoroughly unsound and diseased. II is un-
sound in religion, in morals, in manners, and
in politics. In its love of liberty it runs into
licentousness, in its hatred Of law, it runs into
Iawlessness. 1t tforgets thatto all human things
the law of limit applies, and it loses sight of
the old saying that extremes meet. But to the
point.


The Tribune Of the 7th of February, with the
view we presume of getting up among the
northern people an excitement against their
brethren of the south, and thus injuring the
success of the Nebraska bill published the fol-
lowing:


""a SLAVE BURNED TO DEATH.-A mob was
collected together and lynch court was held
to determine what was best to be done with a
negro who had the. impudence to raise his hand
against white man. The lynch court decided
that he should be burned at the stake. A
Natchez paper, the Free Trader, giving an ac-
count of it, says the negro was taken and
chained to tree Immediately on the banks OF
the Mississippi, on what is called Union Point.
Fagots were then collected and piled around
him, to which he appeared quite Indifferent.
When the work was completed, he was asked
what he had to say. He then warned all to
take example by him, and asked the prayers
of all around. He then called for drink Of
water, hich was handed him; he drank it and
said Now set fire, | am ready to go in peace
The torches were lighted and placed in the
pile, which was soon ignited. He watched un-
moved the curling fame, that grew until it be-
gan to entwine itself around and fix upon his
body, and then he sent forth cries Of agony,
painful to the ear, begging some one to blow
his brains out at the same time struggling with
almost superhuman strength, until the staple
with which the chain was fastened to the tree
(not being well securely drew out and he leaped
from the burning pile. At that moment the
sharp ringing of several rifles were heard, and
the body of the negro fell corpse on the
ground. He was picked up by some two or
three and again thrown into the fire and con-
sumed, not vestige remaining to show that
such a being ever existed. Nearly four thou
sand slaves were collected from the plantations
in the neighborhood to witness this scene. Nu-
merous speeches were made by the magistrates
and ministers Of religion, to the large concourse
of slaves, warning them, and telling them that
the same fate awaited them if they should prove
rebellious to their owners""


The above extract went the rounds of the
abolition and freesoil press. 1t was eagerly
caught up and circulated everywhere. 1t bore
upon its face strong evidences Of truth. 1t was
minutely circumstantial. 1t purported to be
taken from the Natchez Free Trader.


1t is, however, one of those. base frauds that
unscrupulous men will get up in times of ex.
element. Il has some foundation, but in all
its particulars is essentially false. The aboli.
tionists have missed the mark in this instance
The barbarity of which they give such terrific
pictures, is all on the side of those whom they
represent as gentle, patient, christian victims


The Natchez Free Trader, whose attention
has been called to the above extract thus
speaks of it, and we beg to call to its remarks
the attention of our readers. 1t says:


In our issue Of the 18th instant, we pro-
nounced the story an entire fabrication and
so it is essentially. 1t processes to relate re-
cent occurrence, pretending to quote the Ian
guage of the Free Trader, and altogether pre-
sents picture Of horror such as has never be-
fore been witnessed The circumstances on
which the fiction is doubtless founded, occurred
from the best information we can get, in the
summer or fall of l84l.

WrLKEs-BARRI, Pa, 9th August, 1856.
.Messrs. Editors:


Ny prediction in a previous
letter to the Herald, concerning Gov. Rec
der's removal, has been verified; and the
people of Kansas must now experience the
relief, felt by sleeper under an incubus,
when suddenly restored to wakefulness.-
The explanations demanded by the Presi-
dent of his Excellency, touching the char
ges Of illegal land speculations, came forth
as clear as black cload In a dark night;
and have had the effect to disappoint his
friends throughout the country egregiously.
His defence embraces but two material
points. The first, in regard to the pur-
chase of Indian lands. he answers in the
following language;-""If there is any
wrong in the matter it is not ""a wrong
committed, but at most only wrong at-
tmpted, and in the face of all probability
a wrong which we expected to be sane
toned by the President"" 1t was cat
most only ""a wrong attempted -"" a wrong
which we expected to be sanctioned by
the President!!''


The second point is simply demurrer !;
1. E. the Governor does not deny his guilt
in ""other speculations in the lands of
Kansas, apparently in violation of Acts
Of @Congress &c."" but that ""the very
general manner in which the char
ges are stated, the entire absence of
any specification on which to make a
point OF raise an issue"" might cause him
to ""wander in side issues, departures.
evasions and uncertainties, without ever
reaching conclusion % Pettlfogging is
generally contemplate, which even bad
case will not justify. but this position of the
Governor is laughable.

an agonizing wall over Reeder's removal;
and in discussing the matter, do not fail to
consult their vocabulary of literary gar
bage and choice lies.. Abolitionism and





Truth are Antipodes. witness so much

be utterly without foundation, that my
prejudices against Abolitionists, are fast
growing into hatred. And the meanest

We clip the above from the Erening Jour-

Alameda county informs us that Tanning, a
young man of 81, had had difficulty with
Squire White Of that county, and had been
heard to say that Mr.. White would not long
possess his property Gncluding horse) Not
long afterwords Mr.. WIS house was set on fire.
and flaming was suspected of being the in
cendiary, and for this supposed offence it is
supposed that Tanning was hung. A man
went into Fanning's Broadway House in San
Antonio, on Sunday evening, and asked the
landlady whether she could furnish boarding
to himself and four or five companions. She
replied ''yes."" He went out, and returned in
few minutes with five Companions. The
party went up stairs to Fannings room, and
took him out with little or no opposition on
his part The landlady suspected something
wrong. Soon after leaving the house. the
party were joined by ten or fifteen other men,
and they were not again seen. flaming was
undoubtedly executed by them that night; but
it is not known whether he had trial accord
ing TO the better usages Of Judge Lynch, or
whether he was strung up without investiga-
tion or delay. According to our information
the case looks very much like murder.

lynch Law on salmon Creek.","","


Mr.. J. w. Evans, writing to the editors Of the
Mountain Herald from Bestville, klamath Co.,
gives the particulars of hanging affair that
took place at that locality on the 10th inst


The victim was young man by the name Of
Moran, born and raised in the city of New York,
and who, it will be recolected by our readers,
on Christmas night last, stabbed to the heart a
man by the name OF Craig, in the Ell Dorado
Bowling Saloon, on Sawyer's Bar. He then
made his escape, but was subsequently, arrested
at the head Of Scott Valley while making his
way towards Shasta, and taken to Bestyille and
delivered into the hands of the anihorities-
While the prisoner was being examined before
Justice Evans, the mob hastily organized, took
the prisoner from the hands of the officers, Sc
lected jury of twelve men, gave him counsel,
and then, under the eye of Judge Lynch gave
him trial. The jury rendered verdict Of
g Guilty of Manslaughter in the First Degree
The mob then, in violationof the verdict, hung
the prisoner in halt an hour after the rendering
of their own jury. He died almost without a
struggle.


This terrible tragedy grew out of the ycircnm-
stance of the whipping of an old man, Davis,
by scoundrel named McDivitt, who was SUBJ
sequently arrested by the mob, and, after re-
ceiving twenty-one lashes on his bare back, was
compelled to leave the river.


The Herald of the Goth says:


="" Messrs. Coleman, of Marysvie and Hearn,
of this place, have formed ""A company for the
purpose of establishing and erecting Tele-

Much complaint has lately been made by ,he
Mexican population in our midst, in reference 70
the action of certain parties who claim to be
invested with authority as members of Com.
mittees of Vigilance. We confess we have given
the subject too little attention, satisfied as VA
are that wrong has been inflicted upon innocent
persons in the name of that sort Of justice which
| is appeased by violence. The undisguised FEEL
| ing which prevails to great extent among oar
mining population against all foreigners does not
stop to consider that the Mexican people held
rights and interest here long before cur laws were
| substituted for theirs; and although we boast Of
the freedom we brought to the Pacific shores the
| occupants we found here often have just cause
! TO complain Of our encroachments end our in.
| tolerance. The genuine American feeling should
| pride itself On its liberality and magnanimity,
instead of exercising disposition to override awe.
and crush the weak. The rights Of the humblest,
as well as the greatest, should be held alike Sa-
cred. That there are bad Mexicans, their own
people know, and frankly confess, yet let them
be held amenable Ia the law. Ii is not Of the
law, but of violence, the Mexicans complain
and who in any community, whose boast is tho
supremacy of civil law, does not alike deprecate
violence We are not Of those who recognize
either the right or the proprety of any selEcon.
stituted committee to step forward as judges and

and there are instances of fragrant outrage where
popular opinion will support it; yet the prece,
dent is perncous one, and the spirit, ii un.
checked is dangerous to liberty, and disastrous
to the peace Of society.


In the La Cromica, of the 30th ult., we find
petition of our Mexican citizens addressed to
the Deputy Mexican Consul at San Francisco,
on this subject. Mr.. Bolton has referred the
matter to the Mexican Minister at Washington

lice peace, say: 1--WE do not ask that these Grim
inals should be pardoned. We do not assert that
they are not guilty of crime All we require is
law and order; and we believe We have perfect
right to demand that our citizens be delivered to
the proper authorities, that their cause may bc
publicly judged according to the laws. If in this
country we are never to have any guarantee to
life or property; if we are not to live beneath
the protection of the authorities and the laws,
it would be better that they fix Gpon some time
for our entire expulsion and the world will then
know which is the guarantee that the foreigner
has in this country, aud the manner in which trea-
ties made with friendly foreign nations are COM
piled with.


I"" In the commerce, mining, agriculture and
arts are daily seen by innumerabe number Of
Mexicans assisting although perhaps on small
scale, to develope the riches of this country;

Lowe Murdered i'm Jail.","","The soil of Kentucky is red with the
blood Of men who died in fair Combat.
and those who have been buchered in cold
blood. But of tie latter we know of no
case more atrocious than the assassination
of Thomas S. Lowe. in the Hawesville
Jail, yesterday. by blood thirsty and cow
ardly mob.


A fued had existed for year between
Lowe and Cieeor Maxwell, Common wealth a
Attorney of that Judicial District. which
had its origin in party politics. Lowe sent
his adversary challenge sometime since,
which he refused to notice. Lowe then
sent him word he would cowhide him
on sight Maxwell did not attend Court
at last term, and it is said for the reason
he Nished to avoid personal conflict
with his determined and desperate foe.


The Court met on Tuesday, and Lowo
publicly declared Maxwell poltroon and
coward. The information was given to
Maxwell, who armed himself and with a
body offriends, attacked Lowe. The latter.
as we related yesterday. retreated. A
number of shots were fired, one of which
killed a man named Aldridge. or Eskring
Lowe was thought for while the mob
would lynch him. but finally he was taken
to prison and disarmed.


The town was fsvarish with excitement,
and on Wednesday night. the mob. who
of course hated Lowe. (mobs always hate
brave men) increased in numbers and the
thirst for blood. During the night it was
decided to force the Jail and lynch Lowe,
or if they couldn't approach him. kill him
outright.


On yesterday morning. in accordance
with tie plans, the mob attacked the Jail.
and fearing to lay hands upon their victim,
fred upon him. He received some sixteen
or eighteen balls in vital parts, and died



Glutted with vengeance, the mob then
retired.


Lowe leaves family who re.ide in
Hawesvlle. His father lives in this city.
He was cool, determined and most dan
gerOus man. In all of his brols or shoot
ing affairs. from which until this, he came
out unscathed. he displayed an extraordip-
airy degree of courage, and he doubtless
died as he lived, without fear Of fmortal man

The Express treated with great contempt,

minent and influential presses against Gov.


Weller for not suppressing mob violence, and
| declared, as well as we recollect, that, ac-
cording 10 claw and political science"" in
which it seemed to intimate that it was ANA.
zingly well posted, all that the Governor
could do in cases of infractions of the law by
mobs, was to wait until somebody resisted a
civil process, which process it was the duty
of subordinate officers to originate and en-
force. 1t now concludes that there is way
in which the Governor can act ab initio in
the premises, and says:


1--WE direct the attention of the newly con-
verted claw and order"" press, that are so dis
tressed Mt the alarming prevalence of mob
ocracy,"" and Gov. Weller's failure to enforce
the law, to the fact that that functionary has
issued proclamation. that may be more
touching to their nervous systems than the
late mob hangings were


/ Here follows the proclamation:


! WHEREAS have received satisfactory evil
dence that Il band of lawless individuals did,
on the 30th Of Nov. 1858, at Los Angeles
force the County Jail and take therefrom
prisoner, one Pancho Daniel, and execute him
without authority of law; and whereas, simi-
lar atrocous acts have been perpetrated in
Tuoumne, and some of the other counties of
this State,


Now, therefore, by virtue of the authority
in me vested, by the constitution and laws of
this State, | hereby offer reward of ONE
THOUSAND DOLLARS, for the arrest and
conviction of any, or either of the persons or
parties who have been engaged in these un-
lawful executions.


Of course this proclamation will simply
amount to nothing, because, in order to en-
force the law, it is necessary that public opin-
ion should sustain it. In the eye Of the law,
every man engaged in those hanging opera
tions is guilty of murder, but the people will
not so consider it, and would refuse to allow
one Of their number to be interfered with on
account of his connection with the transac
tions alluded to- Should the local judicial
tribunals issue warrants for the arrest of the
offending parties, and the ministerial officers
undertake to execute them, the people would
make resistance, and protect each other to the
bitter end. The officers would summon as
sistance from the body of the county, but il
would not be forthcoming for respectable
citizens do not like to shoot down their
equally respectable neighbors Then, the
Governor, being called upon, would order
out the volunteer or uniform companies or
other militia of the State"" but they would
probably refuse, to any considerable extent,
to respond to the call. If they did respond,
then there would be civil war Such is, we
think, well founded view of the case based
on the present state of public opinion in Cali
fornia. 1t is deplorable state of opinion We
will admit, and ought to be rectified. But,
such being the condition Unpopular feeling, it
is very doubtful whether Governor Weller
has the nerve, despite his boosted disregard
of popular clamor,"" to press to an extremity
the high-sounding declaration of his inaugu-
raj manifesto, to the effect that he would |
maintain the supremacy of the law at dill
hazards"" 1t is his sworn duty nevertheless
to do this very thing, irrespective of any de-
clarations that he may have made pro or con-


1t is certainly high time that lynch law
were done away with in this country, and
much do we fear that it will not cease for
many years, unless some terrible example is
made. But who viii take the responsibility

John, slave, the property of Berry Gun diff who was arrested about one year since, charged with the murder of Miss Mary Shaler, has confessed lis partlcipa- ton in tbe crime, and duplicates several other persons.

 This Miss Shaler was originally re- sident of Bardstown, but al the time of the murder was temporarily living in La rue county, with Mrs. Murphy. The ne- gro has been twice tried, but each time ,hp iures failed to agree. A few days .fac. the negro was induced to make clran breast of the horrible affair, being threatened with yucbing-persons telling iiu that the Taylor county mob was com- aC 10 hang hun.

 IL says that four other persons were l@nn9ctrd with hun in the affair, he being yn,le tool, and receiving two hundred dollars The persons charged are Mrs. Murphy, her daughter, aged sixteen years, James McCavocll and William l'jakrvll.

Bracy, on Friday, 10Th inst, at Auburn,
violently assaulted a miner named Muir
ply, by striking the sharp point of pick
into the back part of his head, through
which the brain protruded. The friends
of Murphy assembled and demanded the
person of the negro, which was refused
by the Sheriff, whereupon the Jail was
broken open and the negro taken out and
hung. Much excitement prevails, and
great efforts are now being made to bring
these ""Lynchers' to a sense of duty to
their country. Certain claw and order""
journals arc bowling, for buncombe, and
trying to excite ill-feelings and raise
breeze in order to blow their pet ""mob-
bill' out of the reach of ignominious de-
feat, by appealing to the case. The ne
gro, no doubt, thought he had as good a
right to take life with impunity, as had
Herbert, but then he forgot that he was
not Member of Congress and was in
California, where some things can be done
as well as others.


The Auburn Press thus alludes to the
case and takes off the Supreme Court in
parody of ""their opinion on the Archy
case:


We cannot justify or excuse the mob that
hung Bracy, except on the ground of the late
decision of the Supreme Court in the "" Archy
| case"" These people were very much excited,
many were young and nexperienced-oth-
ers, perhaps, in poor health-a1d it was the
first violation of the law. If their case should
be brought before the next grand jury, they
would be forced to notice it--and, in their re-
port, they could say: ""This is fragrant yio-
laton of law and the Constitution, but as the
parties are young men, inexperienced, in poor
health, and it being the first case in which the
county Jail has been broken down, hitherto
supposed almost impregnable; and with the
fullest confidence the like will never be at
tempted again, we find them guilty, but de-

A MAN HUNd BY A MoB.-A few weeks
ago a constable named yimmons. was shot by
U man named Kesler, in Gentry County,
CMo,] under circumstances which made the
act, .in the estimation of the people, a cruel
outrage. The murderer was arrested and put
in Jail at Albany and word sent to Judge Nor
ton, at Platte city, that if a special term was
not held Immediately for the trial of the pris-
oner, he would be tried before Judge Lynch.
Judge Norton called the special term as re-
quested; but, on the trial. it was found that
two of the prisoners important witnesses had
been driven off and could not be found.


The counsel for the defence asked a contin-
uance which was granted; and the Judge,
interring from the appearance of things that
an attempt would be made by tile crowd to
take the prisoner out of the hands of the Of
ficers, appointed guard of twenty five men
to conduct him to jail. But the guard had
no sooner taken It's position than rush was
made by the crowd, and. the prisoner torn
from the officers and born off to the woods
few hundred yards distant. Arrived there,
the prisoner was allowed to say his prayers.
after which a rope was put around his neck
and he was hung to tres. Pne mob was
composed of about fifty persons.--St. Louis
Meas.


STILL ANoTHER.-The st. Louis Republican
has the following account Of the repetition of
the tragedy. The latter is dated on the 9th,
at st. Joseph:


""The people of Gentry have been guilty of
another horrible murder. 1 wrote you of the
summary execution of Kesser for the killing
Of TimnoRs, and stated that, as Miig4n's
case was continued by the state, it was agreed
that he should live until the regular term of
the Circuit Court, and undergo the formali-
tlesof trial. A guard was appointed to
4. watch his prison. No appropriation was made
tor their support, and they became wearied
with so thankless and tedious an employment,
and abandoned their posts The mob went to
the county court yesterday and demanded an
appropriation for the expenses of a guard,
and, upon refusal, they proceeded to the
prison. took Milligan oul and led him to the
same tree upon which Kessler had, ten days
before, been hung. He requested. to be bap-
tized, which was done in brook near by.
Here he hadean interview with his old father
which was deeply affecting. He was then
taken back to the tree and hung until dead""

Dreadful state OF Affairs.","","The arrival Of the Prometheus brings Us fifteen
days later intelligence from California, by way Of
the newly.opened route Of the san Juan de Mica
ragua


The prominent, and by far the most conspicuous
feature of the California news is the prevalence Of
what would be called on this side Of the continent
the supreme authority Of Judge Lynch. In san
Fran .isco IL s the execution Of the decrees Of the
Vigilance Committee of Eve hundred, (not quite so
ceremonious as the old Venetian Council,) in the
prompt punishment Of Grim inals, and for the pre-
servation Of law and order. Strange as il may
sound in this longitude, these of-hand trials and
summary executions are, in good faith, designed
for the preservation rather the restoration, Of
law and order. The criminal may be a murderer,
n horse thief, burglar, an ircend diary, a common
shoplfter, or petty rogue, if the Vigilance Com
mittee catch him, and convict him, be Il instantly
carried out and hung up at the nearest convenient
tree, or beam, or rope and ta,kle. The crime, the
pursuit. the appreh ension, the Indictment the trial.
the judgment, and the execution, may all take
place in the same afternoon. The whole business,
in the case Of Jenkins, was done in the
course Of evening, by moonlight; and in
the case OF Stuart, another Botany convict,
tried also as a thief, the interval between
the commencement Of bis trial and the hanging
was about Eve hours. In the case Of the Mexican
woman a, ,Downieville-who, for fatally stab bng
miner, was tried by the popular process Ia such
cases established, and convicted Of murier-the
blood Of her victim was not yet cold, when the
woman, having been tried, convicted, and con-
demned, was swinging lfeless in the air The
Anglo saxon institution Of the rope, by sort Of
'cH'ra ge""cte, or c0rsiiinDi, may be con-
sldered as pretty vel established in California; but
the rapdity with which il brings the criminal TO
his quetus Is somewhat startling 70 a community
accustomed to the slower formali,ies of law.
This quickness Of the penalty s even more astound-
ing TO our precouceived notions than the rapyo ~
crimes which come under the death penalty bv The
new California code. We have no nice di.linc,ion,
between murder and manslsughter nor betvsos
highway robbery and a petty theft: the same
judgment Of strangulation makes short work Of
them all Truly, this is a terrible state Of things
and Is deeply to be deplored

have reasonable excuses for these summary and
indiscrminato executions. bat their situation l.

on Wednesday morning from San Juan de Nj
caragua, bringing California dates to the 10th of
July. The Prometheus has brought on freight
S57S ,579 in gold dust, besides what she may have
brought in the hands Of passengers, who number
three hundred and sixty. She left San Juan on
Monday, August 4, at III a. m, and arrived at
Staten Island, below New York. on the
18th instant, at ii O'Clock p. M. making the pas
sage in eight days and twelve hours, bringing her
passengers from the steamer Paclhc, which leit
San Francisco on the l4th ultimo, and arrived at
San Juan del Sud on the 29th, with four hundred
and twenty-five passengers and $oOO,OOO IN gold
dust. We learn from the New York Tribune that
the passengers by the Nicaragua route came fif-
teen miles by land carriage; thence took the
steamer Director across Lake Nicaragua; thence
the new iron steamer Sir Henry L. Bulwer down
the San Juan river to the Prometheus, in thirty
two hours running time. They all expressed
themselves very much pleased with the route, and
say that the country is delightful. They had no
sickness.


The following synopsis of events is taken from
the -Alta California of the 18th of July:


''Snce the departure of the mail steamer, on the
first OF the present month, the only event OF mo-
ment which has transpired in city has been the
trial, conviction, and execution of ielon known
Jim Stuart, by the vigilance committee, body
of citizen Of the highest respectabiity and stand
ing in society. He was hung for multiplicity OF
offences, and, by his own confession, voluntarily
made, was villain OF the most desperate charac-
ter. He was hung about o'clock, on Friday, the
llth inst, at the end of Market wharf, in the pre-
sence of several thousand citizens.


GA Spanish woman was hung in Downeville, in
the Sacramento valley, for numbering man
named Cannon, on the 7th inst.


''In Sacramento, Marysvile, Stockton, and else
where, the citizens have felt themselves compelled
to act in their behalf, the laws having proved
so utterly inadequate in themselves, and their ad
ministration by the properly constituted authori-
ties so lax.


""Men have been executed for offences of Grim
inal nature in this city and in Stockton. The
cent execution of Stuart in this city produced
temporary excitement among those who entertained
opinions antagonistic to the action of the COM
mittee; but it appears to be subsiding. His honor
Mayor Brenham has issued proclamation desir
ing all good citizens to withdraw from the vigi-
lance committee, or associations of like charac-
ter; and Judge Campbell, ofGthe court OF sessions,
the 18th instant, charged the grand jury for the
county that all those concerned in the execution of
Stuart had been guilty of murder, or were partceps
criminis.


ercise its powers and is using its utmost endeavors
to rid the community of the villains who have 30
long infested it. Their acts are sustained by ma
jority of the citizens. Organizations of similar
character have sprung up in almost all the promi-
nent places Of California, and the courts have been
forced, by the expression of public sentiment, to
pay stricter attention to the administration OF the
law


""The intelligence from the north is by no means
pleasant. A party of pioneer emigrants, who had
been landed at Point Oxford, above Trinidad, con-
sisting of ten men, under command of Capt Kirk
patrick, were massacred by the Indians. The In
dams in the entire vicinity of Rogue's river, and
the Klamath region, have exhibited the utmost hos
tty against the whites, and being armed with guns
and pistols, as well as bows and arrows, are most
formidable adversary. Several parties of whites
i'm off had
mitted depredations, at the last accounts.


""The Indians are still troublesome in Sacra-
mento valley, and refuse TO come in at the place
specified by DR.. o. M. Wozencraft, oftbe Indian
commissioners. Colonel Mckee, also of the COM
mission, isat Benicia, preparing to prosecute his
mission in the region OF the Klamath and Trinity
rivers. Colonel Barbour is in the vicinity of Los
Angeles, intending to visit again the Indians in the
Tulare valley, who have recently exhibited a dis
position to break their treaty of peace and amity.
The commission are totally without funds, and ut
terly unable prosecute their mission to success
fal issue without additional supplies.


ga rencontre took place on the Let instant be-
tween George F. Lemon, City Assessor, and Will
liam II. Graham, young lawyer. Shots were
exchanged, and Graham was shot in the mouth
and left arm Lemon Immediately gave himself
up, but his adversary having told him to draw and
defend himself, and suited the action to the word
the recorder discharged him. Graham Is out and
doing we'll.


1.-THE 9TH of July was not celebrated with any
great pomp, in consequence of the calamity which
has recently befallen the city 1t was, however,
observed by the firing of guns, parades, &c.
""ln Sacramento City most aggravated highway
robbery committed on the 9th inst, in broad
daylight. Impatient of the laws delay, the peo-
ple by their united expression induced the court,
and the lawyers selected to defend the prisoner, to
70 into trial Immediately, and at last accounts
one of the party was before the court on trial.
""The Mormons making decided movement
toward establishing direct communication from
the Salt Lake to the Pacific. A large party have
recently arrived from Salt Lake through the Cajon
Pass, about sixty miles from Los Angeles, with an
expressed determination to settle in that section.
They said to be negotiating for the purchase OF
a very fine rancho belonging to Senior Antonio
Longo.


""fhe intelligence from the mines continues to
be extremely encouraging, and a general spirit
of contentment seems to prevail among the miners.


""The effects of the late fire in this city are yet
percephble. but the energy and enterprise OF our
citizens appears to be unabated. The burned
district although not entirely rebuilt, is pretty
thickly studded with tenements of all descriptions,
and brick and stone buildings of the most sub
stantial character in process Of erection in all
parts""


The California papers abound with accounts oi
Lynch law executions, of murders, robberies, rev.
elations Of crime, Indian massacree, sc. man
named James Stuart, convicted of murder and rob-
berry, tried, condemned, and executed by the
vigilance committee of San Francisco, on the lth
of July.


The affair had created great excitement at San
Francisco from the fact that the community is di'
vided into two partes-one favoring the admins
tration of the Lynch code by the vigilance com
mittee, and the other opposed to it. AS far as WE
are enabled to judge by the papers, the former are
still in the ascendancy, but how long this state
things will last we cannot say.


The San Francisco correspondent of the New
York Journal Of Commerce, referring to the vigi
lance committee of that place, says:


""Cahfornia, and this city in particular, is pass
| ing through fiery ordeal, resulting from the de
termined efforts of our citizens to rid themselves
the organized bands of thieves, robbers, and mur
derers who have so long infested this community

CuIiforuSn","","blished government there is wholly subverted, and
in its stead substituted vigilance committees
or committees of safety, which recognise no legal
principles or precedents, save what found in
the unwritten and summary code of the law Lynch.
But while all this Is going on, alarming enough in
principle, but, wonderful to say creating no alarm
in practice, the tribunals in all civil matters are
recognised and obeyed. just they are in more
established and in older States Nay, even nice
distinctions drawn between the apparently con-
fiicting jurisdictions of the code Lynch and the
statute law, or law of the land; for we see in St.
Marysville (Cal) Herald before us that the vigi-
lance committee of that place declined to interfere
in Mexican brawl where knives had been used,
and murder almost perpetrated, upon the ground
that the case was not one for them, but for the
statute law. The illustration is SO singular and
sgnihcanrthat we must give our readers the case
in full.


Mexican, it seems, attacked by three
other Mexicans at ST. MarysvilIe, and was SO Sc
verely wounded by knife cuts that he was not ex-
pected to survive. He received seven or eight Sc
we're wounds The cause of the attack is said to
have been dispute, which arose few evenings
since at a Mexican fandango, says the ST. Marys

to proceed. They therefore handed them over to

the extent of which cannot be known when they

Lynch and the courts of law, we see the Difference
yet paid to the civil and statute law.


What is remarkable, nay, astonishing, is that
the Lynch law is becoming the popular law of the
land. The San Francisco Herald, disproving the
rumor that the Governor about to convoke an
extraordinary session of the Legislature in order to
reinvigorate the laws of the land, exclaims


''Tbe truth is, we are getting on remarkably WE'LL
This city is more free from crime than it ever has
been within recollection, and the measures being
taken by the vigilance committee will make it still
more We are fast and imperceptibly getting rid
of all the vagabonds who have been plundering and
numbering so long with impunity. 1t is true, we
have still wretched Judiciary; have a very in
efficient police but the citizens about to correct
all that thing by degrees, They have set a mark
on the .t forehead OF the Judge, and they have
sumed the duty OF the police There is conyie- !
tion in the minds of all that punishment will now
closely follow the heels Of crime, and that crime
can scarcely be committed without detection. 1t
is true that yet there are many things wanting
but what do not want ia an extra session of the
last Legislature. We have many difficulties 10
contend with, but really that would be burdening
US beyond our strength and patience.
""a great denl ia said about the prevalence of |
Lynch law throughout the country. Some three |
or four hundred warlike Indians have put to death
twelve horse thieves, Well, there is nothing very
deplorable in that. We are glad
to know that there is force of sort to restrain
such depredatons in the lower country; and while |
the native Californians have such force, we hope
they will always call .nto requsition against such





nora for murder, and two persons shot in melee |
at the place. II is to be sure, to be regretted
that the murder was committed, and that the melee
was provoked; but nevertheless the death of those
four persons was perfectly natural consequences |
the necessity of which was to be deplorcd of course
but nevertheless natural and unavoidable In this
city man has been executed for burgary-a man |
belonging TO gang of robbers, assassins and in
cendiaries. Lynch law, no doubt--but Just law |
punishment rendered necessary by the prevalence
of crime.


' In all these cases we have noiniustice and
in those in which the citizens the avengers of
the violated law, no haste, passion or thirst for
blood. A firm determination there is to meto out
punishment where it is deserved, and that determi
nation will be persevered in, whether there be an
extra session of the Legislature at Vallejo or not""


This is cool, complacent even. The attachment
of the people to the law is apparent from their
quiet submission to it. The committees of vigilance
proceed, weaee, with great system in all parts At
st. Marysvle there meeting of the COMMITTEES
held at the court house. The organization of the
was completed. There were tive hun
dred and thirteen signera. 1t the intention of
the committee to take complete census of the city,
keeping record of the name and occupation of
every one Locations in which there is any hesi- |
fancy in giving this information, or where the |
manner of doing so is at all suspicious, will be |
strictly watched, says the narrator Of the scepe In
all parts Of California like proceedings going on



This apparently necessary subversion OF the civil |
and statute lava is more nor less than revolu- |
tion, bloodless though it be; but what must aston
ish mankind is the and quetude in which it is
all done. The american element of self. government
is pTging itseifof the dangerous foreign odni1treS
that haze got into The STATE.


We have one other Lesson in this spectacle, and
that is, tho danger of opening State, California
has been opened, to the conyicts and criminals of
the whole earth. Botany Bay, and all the other
British penal settlements in the Pacific, have vom-
ited their criminals upon this rising State. The |
criminals of Chill, of Peru, of all Mexico, have so
fled there for an asylum. Our States this sido
of the Rocky mountains have no doubt disgorged |
their share of murdercrs, thieves robbers burglars
&c-criminals whom police and our laws
could ovcrawe here, but who run riot in California
Such facts as these the Caiornians offer as their
apology for the subversion Of the statute law, and
the establishment Of the code Lynch in its stead |
1t is fearful experiment the necessity for which
no state of society that have yet lived in or

New YoRK, August 6-l0 a. m.-The Empire
City has arrived, having left Chagres on the 25th,
and Kingston on the Both of July. She brings
three hundred and sixty passengers, and 400 900
freight; passengers also bring $500, 600. Her
mails bring San Francisco dates TO July first. She
left the Georgia at Chagres, awaiting the arrival
of the Isthmus and Union at Panama. The EN-
pirc City encountered strong easterly gales during
her passage.


22d of June. 1t commenced on the north side Of
Pacific street, near Powell, at ten O'Clock in the
morning, spreading down Pacific street, through
Broadway and on to Stockton street. In half an
hour il crossed Pacific street, and at the time
crossed Stanton street, spreading rapidly down
Pacific, Broadway, and Jackson streets All in
Broadway, far as jackson street, was destroyed,


On Pacific street 1t extended far as Ohio street,
taking the City Hall and City Hospital In its course
On jackson street every thing was burned to Mont
gomery street, including few houses below on
Stockton street The fire then crossed diagonally
into Washington street, in the rear OF the Baptist
church, which saved. Ii thence extended
down Washington and Dupont streets, taking the
jackson House in its course.


The California restaurant, adjoining tho Alta
California office, was blown up, but did not pre-
vent the flames from crossing in the rear OF the We
randall and extending down Washington street to
Sansom stopping on the south side at Burgoyne's
building. On Montgomery street, the west
side is burnt from Pacific to Washington street.
and also all the east side, with the exception of
two three buildings near the corner of jackson
street.


Between Washington and Clay streets the only
building burned was occupied by Cronan 4 Mark
ley From Washington street the fire cfossed over
in the rear of the Ell Dorado to the new theatre,
which destroyed.


The flames then spread to Merchant street, and
thence crossed into Clay street, below the Califor
mia Exchange, on the north side. Thence the tre
extended to the brick building occupied by Rol
lanl & Wilde, at the of Montgomery street.
Immense quantities Of goods were removed to the
Plaza. which took fire and were destroyed.


The patients in the hospital, numbering ninety,
all saved and removed to lot in the rear OF
the hospital. The prisoners in the city prison were
removed to the county jail, and all the books and
records in the marshaPs office were saved. The
buildings on the Plaza not burnt are the custom
house, the Bella Union, Verandah, Ell Dorado, and

Bach, Burnet, s. Co. In ali, about five hundred
buildings were destroyed, and the loss is estimated
at s ,0O0,0 Immense quantities OF lumber were
consumed. The persons burnt out are generally
insured


The fire was undoubtedly the work of ncendia-
ries and several persons have been arrested, but
positive proof of their guilt has been adduced.
Few heavy stocks of goods were burnt, most oil
the buildings being occupied as dwellings. The
excitement created since the fire against the des-
peradoes living amongst US has resulted in the
determination on the part OF the citizens to pre-
vent the landing of persons from penal colonies,
unless they produce testimonials of character
The proceedings of the vigilance committee have
been generally sustained by the community.


Captain Snow, worthy citizen of Sonora, has
been murdered by two assassins, and in two days
afterwards the ruffians were taken and hung by
the populace, under the most intense excitement.
In a Carson's diggings two Americans
and some four or five Mexicans were killed.
A large number of Mormons from Salt Lake Val
| ley had arrived at Los Angeles.
Colonel Barber, of the Indian commission, has
been compelled to suspend operations for want OF
funds j DIR. Woosencroft was progressing at hi
own expense.


Two men, named Watkins and Briar, had been
convicted of burglary and sentenced-one to ten
and the other to five years imprisonment
A party of nine men, under Captain Fitzpatrick,
had been cut off by the Indians at Pague river, and
all most inhumanly murdered.


| man named Lewis Pollock was called from his
bed on the night of the great fire and shot dead by
| man named Samuel Gallagher.
| The citizens of Marysville had formed vigiant
committee for the protection of their lives ano
property.


The accounts from the mines and placers were
| very laVoraDlC, anu tue prospectus Vi Vic eioPs
| throughout the country were very encouraging
San Francisco is being rebuilt very rapidly, not
| withstanding her sad reverses. Two hundred
buildings have been erected during the past week
HORRIBLE MURDER AT SoNoRA.-A most shock
| ing and horrible murder has been perpetrated al
Sonora, the details of which seldom equalled
Some persons who had taken offence at an article
which appeared in the Sonora Herald, went to the
room of the editor, DR.. Gum, dragged him from
his bed, and deliberately shot him through the
head. He died instantly. They also murdered
two other persons connected with the some office
and killed wounded some three or four others
who went TO their assistance. This affair has pro-
duced the most intense excitement
California shipments continue large, and far be-
| yond actual wants.

| THE MAnKETs.-Previous to the fire there wat
an improved demand for all kinds Of goods. The

market, but there stills remains fair demand

in fair request at $50 for common to $50 SsS(

the Pacific Mail Steamship Company
was robbed on Saturday, after leav.
ing Panama seven miles on the way.
The news flew like electricity
through Panama, -and merchants,
officers and seldiers forthwith started
in hot pursuit.
After riding seven miles, Captain
Garrison and his friends came up
with the specie train, and found it in
the wildest confusion. Three of the
had been shot by the robbers
guard,
and were lying on the road side.
Two were found dying, shot in the
breast, and the other badly wounded.
The robbers had made off with
one box of gold dust- but delayed
by the heavy box, the pursuers soon
over hauled them, when they aban-
of
doned the box and fled. Two
the robbers were captured.
Thomas Summers from New York
City was one of them. A rope was
about his neck and Lynch Law
Put,
was making the last of him, when he
begged for his life, and promised to
tell all, if they would not hang him,
-when he did tell the whole story,
and of all the persons engaged with
him.
Another party of the pursuers
overtook Charles Cromwell, an intelligent
colored gentleman from
New York City. He too begged
hard for his life, and they spared him
after he made full confessions, but
until he had been half hung,
not some ten minutes.

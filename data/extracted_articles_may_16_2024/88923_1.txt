The failure of the Oxford,( Ohio)
mob after three efforts to lynch a man
speaks well for law and order's rule
there. The mob didn't know how to
do the job. Some other northern or
western localities would not have
lacked the experience.- Savannah( Ga.
News.)
A Kentucky man who was about to
be lynched by a mob at Oxford, Ohio,
was given time to pray and while he
was so engaged he was rescued by a
sheriff's possee. This incident should
be very useful in bringing prayer into
more general use in Kentucky.-

A dispatch from Shreveport, La.
says: Tom Jackson, a Negro,
who had been arrested for holding
up and robbing Hassel Barnes, a
white boy of$ 1.00 was lynched at
Blanchard, La., early to- day. The
Negro's body riddled with bullets
, was found in a field half a
mile from where he had been
chained. Incidents of this kind
are innumerable and proves that
the black men is not lynched solely
for the nameless crime. No
white man is ever lynched for so
offence, Colorphobia is
the trifling cause of mob murder.

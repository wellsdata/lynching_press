NARROW ESCAPE FROM LYNCH LAW.- A worthless
young negro named John Paraway, living at Wesminis-
ter, Md., narrowly escaped lynch law last week. It appears
from the Sentinel that a daughter of the Rev. T.
Gallaudet, one of the most excellent and amiable young
ladies in the county, took a stroll alone to Sunset Hill,
where she was sketching some views of the grand and
picturesque scenery around it, when she was suddenly
approached by Paraway. Alone and unprotected, she
suddenly became almost frantic with fear, when she entreated
him to leave her, to which the young vagabond
threatened to knock her head off if she attempted to es
cape or scream. She had no money, but gave him a fine
ring, when just at that opportune moment Charles Stu!-
ler, who was out guuning, hove in sight, when the reprobate
left her and went t Stuller with the utm con
posure and exhibited the ring, which, he said, the young
lady gave him. Hastily returning home, Miss G. discovered
to the family what had occured; the neighbors soon
wind of it formed impromptu committee of vigi-
got an
,
lance, arrested the young scoundrel, and would have
lynched him on sight had not wiser counsels
He was finally committed for trial. prevailed.ex'ensive

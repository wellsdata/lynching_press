NEW YORK, Sept. 10.- In response
to a telegram from the World announcing
the arrival of an English syndicate
sent here to investigate and denounce
lynching and asking for personal views
as to English meddling with American
affairs, the following reply was received
from overnor O'Ferral of Virginia:
" Things have come to a pretty pass in
this country when we are to have a lot
of English moralists sticking their noses
into our internal affairs. It is the
quintessence of brass and impudence.
They had better sweep in front of their
own doors before seeking to regulate
us. We might as well investigate British
affairs in India, her Whitechappel murders
, her Jack- the- Ripper slashings, her
Maybrick trial, and her alleged injustice
and cruelty to this woman, her rapacious
colonial policy in Africa, and the degrading
effects upon the Chinese resulting
from her opium war. What do they
propose to do in case they find that the
law is not administered here according
to their ideas? war against us,
or open the vials Declare of their wrath upon our
AND STATE EXECUTIVES DENOUNCE
FOREIGN INTERFERENCE.
Governor O'Ferral of Virginia and
Fishback of Arkansas Are Advised
of the Arrival of an English Syndi-
eate to Inquire Into Lynchings and
Express Views with No Uncertain
Sound Their.

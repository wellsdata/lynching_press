At daybreak the 300 convicts in the
penitentiary learned of Wigfall's presence
. At 8:30 a. m., while being
marched to the broom factory, the
prisoners suddenly leaped upon the
guards and the turnkey, overpowered
them and took the keys to Wigfall's
cell. Taking a rope from the turnkey's
office, they rushed to the ne-
gro's cell. They looped one end of
the rope about Wigfall's neck and
fastened the other end about a railing
50 feet above the main floor of the
prison rotunda.
Cursing loudly, their yells mingling
with the pleadings of the negro for
mercy, the convicts seized Wigfall
and hurled him over the railing into
the rotunda. The victim fell 25 feet
and his neck was broken.
A remarkable scene followed. Satisfied
that their victim was dead, the
prisoners made no effort to escape
from the prison. Instead, without a
word they reformed their lines and
,
waited ready to march to the broom
factory,.

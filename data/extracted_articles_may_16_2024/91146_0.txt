DECREASING
LYNCHING SLIGHTLY
At the end of six months of the
present year there had been 24
lynchings. At the end of 10
months( November 1) there had
been 45 lynchings, a reduction of
four as compared with the same
period for 1912. Within the past
four months- July, August, Sep-
tember and October- since I last
called attention to the subject,
there have been 21 lychings, making
a total, as I have said, of 45
lynchings for 10 months. Of this
number only seven individuals, or
15 per cent. were charged with
rape.
It is worth while, I think, to
note a few typical cases for which
human life was taken by a mob.
July 27, a Negro, at Dunbar, Ga.,
supposed to be a burglar, charged
with shooting the proprietor of a
store. Also in July, two colored
farmers were lynched near German-
town, Ky. The commercial Appeal
, the leading white newspaper
of Tennessee, in commenting upon
the lynching said:" Two apparently
inoffensive Negroes, good
farm hands, real wealth producers,
were assassinated." No motive
was assigned for the lynching.
The Commercial Appeal further
said:" As far as any one knows,
they were quiet, orderly people."
August 18, the Sheriff at Spar-
tanburg, S. C., in spite of the fact
that dynamite was used, prevented
a mob from lynching a Negro
accused of assaulting a white woman
. He was tried later before a
white jury and found not guilty.
August 23, a half- witted Negro
near Birmingham, Ala., for frigh-
tening women and children.
August 25, a Negro accused of
murber at Greenville, Ga. A few
days later another Negro was arrested
and confessed. An innocent
man had been lynched.
August 27, a Negro at Jennings,
La., for striking an Italian merchant
who had swept dirt on the
Negro's shoes as he was passing
the store.
In 10 months, as stated above,
45 persons have been put to dealh
by mob- law. A reduction of the
number of lynchings by four,
though small, means something
in the way of a higher civilization

" Now that a serious riot has resulted
from an attempt to lynch a negro
in Akron, Ohio, the north has no longer
the shadow of an excuse to blame
the south for its treatment of the
black man", said Mr. Henry K. Cooper,
of
Cleveland, a Chamberlin's last
night." Akron, you know, was for
many years the home of Ossawattomie
John Brown, the liberator, and in the
days before the civil war was one of
the most important stations on the
' underground railroad,' along which
runaway slaves were helped on their
way to Canada. It is, moreover, in
the heart of the Ohio Western Reserve,
the great citadel and stronghold of
abolition and only a few miles from
the home of Joshua Giddings, who in
the old days used to make the halls
of congress ring with his denunciation
of the crime of holding the black man
in bondage. It was part of the religion
of those old Puritanical descendants
of the settlers from Connecticut
that the negro was a brother, and from
no other part of the country have
stronger protests
come against
the
lynchings of negroes in the south. If
the negro is not safe from mob violence
there, he is safe no where on earth.
" It only goes to show that human passions
are much alike the world
and that an assault by a black around beast
stir will child or woman white a upon a into citizen
an ordinarily peaceful citizen
only of
savage animal with thoughts
destruction. So long as the negro is
such awful
capable of committing
crimes, just so long will he be hunted
to earth and put to death as a man-
eating tiger or other ferocious beast
would be destroyed. It is reasonable
to believe from the fury displayed by
the Akron mob that had it secured the
victim he would have been subjected
to all the nameless tortures that have
the most vicious lynchings
attended in the south."- Washington Post.

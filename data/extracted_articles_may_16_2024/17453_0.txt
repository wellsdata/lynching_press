TAKEN BY MOB
Prisoner Prisoner Who Assaulted
Woman Has Probably
Been Lynched
Russellville, Ky., July 5.- James
Lyon, who was charged with assaulting
Miss Mary Gladder, was taken
from the jail by a mob of 100 men
shortly before midnight and it is sup
posed that he was lynched.
When the mob reached the jail the
other three men imprisoned on a simi
iron
lar charge had crawled up the
railing and hid in the big water tank
near the ceiling.
When the crowd got well inside John
Sacka, whose trial has been in progress
since Monday, dropped to the
floor and rushed out of the door. He
met the sheriff and his deputies, out
side the jail yard and they ordered him
to stop. He rushed on and they snot
at him four times, wounding him
twice. Neither wound is thought to
be fatal.
The shooting' near the square frightened
the mob in the jail and they hurried
off with only one of the men,
Lyon, leaving two others in jail. These
two, together with the wounded man,
were taken away shortly afterwards to
Bowling Green. It is supposed that
Lyon, who was taken away by the
mob was hanged in the outskirts of
the town,.

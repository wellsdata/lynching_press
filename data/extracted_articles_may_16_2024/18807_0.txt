AGAINST LYNCH LAW.
A Chicago Negro Predicts a Revolt
of His Race.
Chicago, May 25.- Speaking as a
representative man of the colored
race in Chicago, Ferdinand Barnett,
one of the assistant state's attorneys,
stated last night that the time was
not far disant when the 10,000,000 ne
groes of the United States would forcibly
revolt against lynch law. He
said:
" There appears to be no other
course left for us. Lynch law in the
South has gradually made the negro
feel that he is an outlaw. In the last
fifteen years 2,500 negro men, women
and children have been shot, hanged
or burned at the stake, without trial.
The negro has, consequently, come to
know that the law affords him no protection
."
Mr. Barnett uttered these remarks
at an indignation meeting of colored
people held at the Bethel African
church to protest against the recent
lynching of Louis F. Wright, of Chi-
cago, at New Madrid, Mo. Wright was
22 years old and resented an attack
on the street. He was arrested and
later hanged. Funds were collected
last night prosecute those who took
an active part to in the lynching.

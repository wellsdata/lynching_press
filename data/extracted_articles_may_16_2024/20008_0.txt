WHITEHALL, Wis., March 14.- Ole C.
Sletto, Ole J. Hanson and Bertha M.
Olsen were yesterday found guilty of
murder in the first degree for complicity
in the lynching of Hans Jacob Olsen on
Sunday, November 24. Immediately
after this verdict had been returned and
the succeeding excitement had in some
measure subsided the parties arrested
and held on the double charge of riot
and lynching Olsen, twenty- five in number
, were arraigned in court. Mr.
Frawley, attorney for Charles Johnson,
the man who led the mob and who had
already confessed to being guilty of
murder in the first degree addressed
the court saying that his client
wished it understood that the rioters
were led by him and that it was at his
instigation that the crime was committed
. He therefore asked for the
clemency of the court on their behalf.
Judge Newman immediately passed
sentence upon the rioters fixing the
penalty at$ 100 fine and writs of prosecution
or six months in the county jail
except in the case of Elbert Olsen who
has already been three months in jail
and whose fine was fixed at$ 50 and
three months in jail. The sentence on
Sletto, Mrs. Olsen and Hanson with
Charles Johnson the confessed
was deferred until this afternoon murderer.

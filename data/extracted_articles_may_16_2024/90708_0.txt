Apologists for Lynching.
If Judge Brand of Georgia made
the remarks that he is credited
with in regard to the recent lynching
of two Negroes in Walton
county, he has shown himself unfit
for the high position which he
holds, for it is the duty of the officer
of the law to uphold the law,
regardless of public prejudice or
the immediate effects of his act.
It is said that he admits that he
knew that the Negroes would be
by a mob if taken back to
Walton lynched county from Atlanta with-
out armed protection. In his defense
, he says:
" I am opposed to lynching, but
if I had called the military and
some young man among the soldiers
was killed, or some of the
citizens of Walton county were
killed, I would never forgive my-
self" He added." I don't propose
. to be the engine of sacrific,
Union, a constitution which the
public officer is sworn to uphold;
a constitution which draws no
line as to" race, color or previous
condition of servitude."
Lynch
law is anarchy of a very heinous
type, but if lynch law be anarchy,
what can be said of such utterances
and such conduct as
from men in high places? this

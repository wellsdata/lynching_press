that Governor Mathews of West Virgin
ia has instructed Attorney- general White
o assist the prosecuting attorney of
Wetze county in discovering the identity
of the lynchers of Jolin Wallace,
and bring them to speedy punishment
.
It has been frequently assorted that
several members of the party who lynch.
en Wallace were recognized and are
well known, and if the law officers of
our sister State are in earnest, they will
doubtless find some work blocked out
to their hands. dory tay
Governor Mathews proved himself
equal to public during
a emergency
the strike last summer. We shall wait
and see if he will rise to the present occasion
.
There is no doubs of the wrongfulness
both moral and legal, of men who, to
use the common phrase, take the law
in their own hands' to the punishment
of malefacters. To be sure, there is
great provocation in the frequency and
atrocity of the crimes which have lately
deluged the country, to which may be
added a disgust at the delays and inex
actions of the law. But all the sealo not
Geo.justify lynch law. Communities must
learn this, and West Virginia is a good
place, in view of the frequent lynchings
in that State, to begin the work of
formation- Cumberland News. re

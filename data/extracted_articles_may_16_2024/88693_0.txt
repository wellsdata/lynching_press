BY MOB FOR MURDER
OF GEORGE DUBOSE
Two Blacks Taken From Jacksonville
Jail, Riddled With Bullets and
Dragged Around by Neck
BY Associated Press
Jacksonville, Fla., September 8.
A mob broke into the county jail
shortly after midnight, took there-
the
negroes held for
from two
murder of George Dubose, carried
them in automobiles into the out-
city, riddled them
skirts of the
with bullets, put ropes around
their necks and dragged them
through the city streets, dropping
one of the bodies in front of one
of the leading hotels.
Sheriff's deputies and police are
searching for the other body.
The sheriff learned early in the
night that there might be an attempt
to lynch a negro held in jail
on the charge of attacking a lit-
advice of
tle white girl, so, on
Judge Simmons, he put the negro
in an automobile and sent him to
St. Augustine for safe keeping.
Arriving at the jail and not finding
this negro, the mob took the
other two and put them to death.
It is estimated that there were only
about fifty men in the crowd that gained
entrance to the county jail. Answering
a knock at the front door of the jail
shortly after 1:00 a. m., Jailer Tucker
was covered with pistols and ordered to
make no move or outery. He was quickly
handcuffed, relieved of his keys, and ordered
to point out the tier of cells in
which the negroes were confined. The
apparently knew the negroes and
men after securing them quietly left the jail.

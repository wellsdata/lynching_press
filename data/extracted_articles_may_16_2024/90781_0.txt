COLOR LINE LYNCHERS.
Frankfort and Trigg County Murderers
Pleased With Their Job.
The color line is drawn sharply by
lynchers in Kentucky Several weeks
ago a Frankfort Negro was lynched by
a mob for having shot a circus man.
In Trigg county a Negro boy charged
with attempted assault was lynched.|
Between the dates of these two lynchings
Dr. Nuttall, a physician in charge
of patients at the Feeble Minded institute
at Frankfort, was charged with
having assaulted a woman under his
care. He was allowed ample time to
make preparations to avoid arrest, and
after a good deal of delay that might
easily have been avoided a reward was
offered for him. There was no apparent
interest upon the part of the authorities
in bringing him to trial.
The hoodlums at Frankfort and those
in Trigg county committed murder
merely for the pleasure there was in
stringing up a defenseless victim. The
three brothers of the girl in Trigg
county to whom an improper proposal
was made were guarding the Negro on
his way to jail when the mob interfered
. Their conduct under trying circumstances
was creditable. The Negro
would, of course, have been convicted
if he had been put in jail and tried. A
Negro charged with attempted criminal
assault is not dealt tenderly with
by a jury of white men.
There is but one conclusion to be
drawn from the three cases. Attempted
criminal assault is punishable by
death without trial if the accused is
black. Shooting and wounding are punishable
by death without trial if the
accused is black. Criminal assault is
to be winked at if the accused is white
and prominent. It is difficult to decide
which is more humiliating to decent
citizens, the mob murders or the contemptible
machinery of the law which
admits of being shown to Dr.

A Mob of Men Raid a Jail, Take Lee

MEMPHIS, July 23.- Lee Walker, the
negro who assaulted Miss Mollie McCadden
and a colored girl, was lynched here last
night in spite of the fact that twenty- five
well- armed deputy sheriffs guarded the
jail.
The attack on the jail began at 11 o'clock.
It was not believed it would be successful,
and Sheriff McLendon ordered his men not
to hurt anybody. The crowd grew in numbers
and at 12:15 a m broke down the
,..
jail gates. Even then the sheriff would
not permit his men to use their weapons.
Finally a rush was made, and MeLen-
don was knocked senseless with a chair.
The mob then battered down the
doors and dragged Walker from his cell.
He fought fiercely and bit several men severely
. He was stabbed and slashed until
blood streamed from him in torrents. He
was hustled off to a telegraph pole two
blocks away and a rope was fastened
around his neck. He was lifted up and
his then swung 1.
naked body clear of the
ground. Then a big railroad switchman
pulled his legs until his neck cracked. The
same man mutilated the corpse. The negro
was dead, or nearly so before he was
hanged .;
There were probably 5,000 persons in
the crowd around the jail, but not more
than 100 took an active part in the affair.
They were nearly all railroad men. One
of them stumbled and fell while the victim
was being carried to the telegraph
pole and the crowd trampled on him,
breaking his jaw and probably injuring
him fatally. Sheriff McLendon is badly
hurt. He seems to have concussion of
the brain.
Walker tried to commit suicide before
he was lynched by cutting his throat with
a glass bottle found in his cell. After the
body was cut down the mob raided a lumber
yard and building a bonfire burned the
negro's body. By 2 o'clock the town
become quiet. had

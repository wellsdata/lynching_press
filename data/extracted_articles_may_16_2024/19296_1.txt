THIS UNKNOWN FEMALE
passed as Mrs. Blank. Her hiding place
was ascertained to be in a small village in
Wyoming territory. In the same village
lived a second woman whose real name is
Blank. Into her hands fell a letter intended
for the bogus Mrs. Blank, and in
the search for the real owner of the epistle
it came out that the said owner was taking
extraordinary pains to conceal her identity;
that she visited the postoffice only at hours
the least liable to be observed, always approaching
by a rear street and entering by
the side door. Having lost one letter, she
gave the postmaster explicit orders regarding
her mail and alsogave him the post marks
which her letters would bear. The detective
showed a photo of Sarah Graham to the
postmaster and he immediately identified
the photograph as that of the mysterious
Mrs. Blank. The present whereabouts of
the woman are not known and a search
and arrests are prophesied in the near future
. The motives of this conspiracy, which
resulted in Graham's lynching and the tarnishing
of Mrs. Malloy's fair name is said
to have been a quarrel between Gorham
and Graham regarding the division of certain
spoils and Mrs. Graham's wrath because
husband had bestowed his hand
upon another her woman.

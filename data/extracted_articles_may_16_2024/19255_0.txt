CAPTURED A PRIZE.
How a Telegraph Oper ator Corralled
an Escaped Murderer.
ERIE, Pa., Feb. 27 .-[ Special Telegrain to
the BEE.]- William C. Bush, who was sentenced
to be hanged for the murder of his
brother and who made a bold escape by sawing
his way out of the Ridgeway jail, was
captured yesterday. The murderer had made
his way into the woods and, being hungry and
almost frozen, ventured to approach the station
at Falls Creek on the Low Grade railway
, where he asked the operator, James
Murray, for something to eat. The operator
sized Bush up and identified him as the escaped
convict. Suppressing his enthusiasm
over the prospect of obtaining
$ 500
reward, the operator succeeded in get-
tin Bush into a little hotel,
where he gave him supper and bed. He then
telegraphed to the sheriff at Ridgeway, and
that officer, who had just returned from a
fruitless search with a posse, responded to
Murray's telegram. Meanwhile Murray had
stood guard with a revolver, determined not
to allow his prize to escape. Sheriff Gainor
forced Bush's door without warning, and
ironed him. Bush was armed, and made an
effort to resist. Sheriff Gainor had some
difficulty in preventing the mob from lynching
Bush. His execution will take place on
the 24th of next month. Bush was almost
frozen. The lucky operator the
reward of$ 500. received

Indemnity
President Urges
Asks Congress to Appropriate
$ 41,030 as" Act of Grace" for
Mob Victims.
Special to Colorado Statesman.
Washington, D. C., President
Wilson continues to grieve the
Colored citizenship of the United
States by his very queer attitude
in all matters affecting them. He
recently served notice on Bishop
Walters of the African Methodist
Episcopal Zion Church that no
Colored man would be appointed
Recorder of Deeds in the District
of Columbia, a place which has
been held by Colored men from
time immemorial. A vacancy has
existed for eighteen months or
more and the belated announcement
is just made that the position
is to be given to a colored man.
During not this same week he con-
gratulates Major R. R. Moten upon
succeeding to the Principalship
of Tuskegee Institute, while ignoring
altogether the death of the man
whom Major Moten is to succeed.
He now follows this up by a
special message to Congress advocating
an appropriation of$ 41,030
indemnity to Greece, Austria- Hungary
and Turkey on account of in-
injuries done to subjects of these
countries, respectively, by mob violence
in riots on February 21, 1909,
at South Omaha, Neb., when Ed.
ward Lowrey, a policemen, was
shot by John Massourides, a Greek
subject whom the officer had arrested
. The request is made of
Congress" as an act of grace and
without reference to the liability
of the United States."
This special message is sent to
Congress by the President during
the same week that announcement
is made of the lynching of 69 men
and women in the South during
the year, 1915. Not a word of protest
issues from the White House
in condemnation of this terrible
lawlessness. A special message
from the President would center
attention upon this deplorable
practice and if the President
could see his way clear that" indemnities
" were paid the victims
lynch law in this country, ths
pratice of would cease.

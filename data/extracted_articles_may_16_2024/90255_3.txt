AN OFFICIAL VIEW.
The City Clerk Thinks the Lynching Wholly
Justifiable.
BOSTON, March 16.-E. F. Manning, city
clerk of New Orleans, is somewhat indisposed
at Young's hotel in this city. Seen
by a reporter regarding the citizen's uprising
in New Orleans Saturday, Manning
said:" It is hard to say when mob law is
justifiable, but if an occasion ever demanded
it, it was the abortive result of
the trial of those men for the murder of
Chief Hennessy. This Mafia is a society
of murderers, of paid assassins. For sums
of money ranging as low as$ 5 it was possible
to get an enemy or a rival put out of
the way. The Mafia had never been molested
till Hennessy came into office. New
Orleans had never had a chief of police
who dared to attack it. When the Mafia
said a man must die his death was swift
and sure. It was never known to fail. A
murderer might escape the penalty of the
law but never the decree of the Mafia."
Maj. Manning, after describing the methods
and numerous crimes of the Mafia continued
:" This was not a wild uprising of
a crazy mob. It was the calm, deliberate
action of the best element of the city.
Lawyers, doctors, merchants and the
higher grades of society were there and
they felt that something must be done.
They, the court of last resort, the people,
knew that these men were murderers and
that no man's life would be safe if, through
barefaced intimidation, the Mafia were allowed
to escape the law. They took it in
their own hands and who can blame them?
The result must be a source of dismay to
the Mafia. It means its utter destruction
in my opinion. The movement against
it will proceed until it is driven from New
Orleans. If any more assassinations
should follow to wreak the vengeance of
the Mafia the people would rise in a body
and sweep the whole race from the face of
the earth. The present chief of police is
following in Hennessy's steps and the
government is determined to uproot city the

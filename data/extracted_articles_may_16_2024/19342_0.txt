morning.
As soon as the facts connected with the
killing became known the greatest indignation
was aroused, and officers and citizens
started in pursuit of Dunnaway, who
has not yet been found, howeyer. He is 21
years old, and it is said is well armed, and
has threatened to return to the scene of
his crime tonight and burn the house, together
with those of others against whom
he
has a grudge. The sheriff and
a party of neighbors are at
Lascassas, and will ef
use every
to Should
he be captured it is believed he will be
promptly lynched. As he once lived in
Texas, some think he may be endeavoring
to make his way to that state with$ 60,
which he forced his father to give him.
Mrs. Dunnaway will in all probability
die cut to
by shot. Nothing concerning the killing
can be obtained from her. The funeral of
the man occurred today and was
largely murdered attended.

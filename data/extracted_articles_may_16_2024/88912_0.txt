Boone, April 23.- Willie Johnson, 26
years old, of Champlin, Minn., a grader
for the Newton& Northwestern railroad
, was caught in a horse stall in a
barn in the act of committing an un-
speakable crime at Frazer at 6 o'clock
last night. A mob gathered and threatened
to lynch him. While he was corralled
in the barn he found a baled hay
wire, tied it to a beam and around his
neck and hung himself by lifting his
feet from the floor. The greatest excitement
prevailed and the anger of the
crowd was such that if he had not killed
himself he would undoubtedly have
fared hard at the hands of the infuriated
mob. The coroner's jury rendered
a verdict of suicide and the remains
were shipped his home in Minnesota
this morning. to

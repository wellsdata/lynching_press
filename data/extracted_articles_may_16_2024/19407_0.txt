To strike a man while was sit
ting in his chair, and he not
anticipating anything, was a dastardly
et. Palmer. too, is a strong man weighing
fifty to sixty pounds more than Griffith.
The people were so incensed that there was
talk of lynching Palmer. Griffith was
knocked senseless to the floor and knew
nothing for some time. Next morning
when he went to his office he found the
bludgeon which Palmer used upon him,
covered with blood. It was left on purpose
by Palmer, who swore at the trial yesterday
that Griffith used it himself, while he
( Palmer) used the butt of his revolver on
Griffith. The people have found out what
Palmer is, and will be glad to be free from
him forever. All honest and respectable
citizens are in sympathy with Griffith irrespective
of parties.
It will prove a big boom for Griffith. His
friends are rallying to his support. Every
Democrat in the county will support
News henceforth. the

MOB ATTEMPTS TO LYNCH.
The negro escaped, but soon a posse
with bloodhounds was on his trail and
the county was in an uproar from one
end to the other. Early yesterday
morning the negro was captured and
taken to Emporia, the strets of which
were filled with crowds. As the prisoner
was taken thru the streets the crowd
grew denser and the air was full of
threats and maledictions. It was with
great difficulty he was taken to the jail,
hands being outstretched to seize
as the doors clanged together. him
The murderer would have been lynched
within five minutes after his arrival
in Emporia had the mob had a leader.
As it was the people surged restlessly
,
around the jail making threats, but
taking no action.,

Mob Law in Evansville, Indiana
Lynching of Two Negroes.
[ From this Evansville Journal, August 1.]
The two negro brutes, who so flendishly
maltreated& white woman on Sunday, fearfully
expiated their crime yesterday afternoon
il be
Early yesterday morning a crowd of ex-
aited people commenced collecting around
the court- house and jail, demanding that
the prisoners be delivered up to them.
The demand was refused, of course, and at
noon the crowd dispersed, and it was hoped
that better counsels would prevail, and that
the guilty wretches would be left to the due
course of the law."
But, after noon, the crowd assembled
again, and the excitement had evidently
increased, and continued to increase until
about 3 o'clock, when the front door of
the jail building was broken open with a
sledge hammer, and the crowd rushed into
the jail. How they reached the prisoners
we did not learn, but they were soon dragged
fo th into the street, beaten down with
clube and shot.
After they were dead, they were taken
up and hanged to a lamp post on the corner
of the street, where they were hanging
at a late hour in the evening. They were,
ultimately, we learn, taken down and
buried.
It was the first scene of the kind ever
enacted in Evansville, and, for the fair
fame of the city, we hope it will be the
laat.
Every one execrates the abominable and
brutal crime committed by the negroes,
but mob law is a dangerous remedy for
evils of this or any kind, and all good citizens
deplore to resort to it; and we hope
this fearful and summary punishment will
such a warning that we shall never
again prove hear of such a crime in our midst.

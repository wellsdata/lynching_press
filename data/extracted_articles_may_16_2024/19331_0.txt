This fiend, who was known among us
as N. B. Rand, has for years notoriously
been pursuing the career which had its
natural ending last evening. It is a
serious question whether this community
is not in a measure responsible for the
crime. It is well known that the matter
of lynching the brute has often been his
suggested, and one sturdy old time
resident was heard lamenting last
evening that he had dissuaded a
party of men, who had organized and
started for the of ridding the
world of such a nuisance purpose.

Unsuccessful Attempt to Storm the Ab-
beyville, S C., Jail.
Abbeyville, S. C., Nov. 26.- An unsuccessful
attempt was made this morning
by a mob of 30 or 40 men to lynch
the prisoners now in jail here charged
with the murder of Nellie Bagwell, the
young white woman whose body was
almost cremated in the building burned
near Hodges Tuesday night. But for
the coolness and discretion of Jailer
Mance and his father, the sheriff, the
murderers would have been hanged to
the trees this morning. The mob came
to the jail and aroused the jailer, saying
they had a prisoner under commitment
. The jailer suspected all was not
well and immediately left the jail
through the back door and notified the
sheriff, who summoned the Abbeyville
Rifles. The tread of the soldiers and
the voice of Sheriff Mance were too
much for the men who were
for blood and they quietly went thirsting away.

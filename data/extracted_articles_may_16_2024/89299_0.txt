The lynching of that man Little at
Butte conveys a warning, not more to
the loud- mouthed and blatant than to
authority charged with the keeping of

and utter licentiousness of speech are
as antithetic as liberty and license. The
Littles and their like should be prevented
from acts that inflame communities
acts unworthy of civilization. Given
to the instance of the Wallace" lecture"

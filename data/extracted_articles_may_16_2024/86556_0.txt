The Chicago Tribune, in answer to
querulous Southern newspapers, has been
at the trouble of collecting the statistics
of lynchings and executions in the South
in the past two years. In 1882 out of
seventy- nine persons hanged fifty- six were
negroes; out of fifty- three lynched forty
eight were negroes. Thus far in 1883,
sixty- four have been hanged, of whom
forty- seven were negroes; sixty- four have
been lynched, of whom forty- six were ne
groes. A much larger number, probably
, have been killed by whites, where
no notice has been taken of the event. It is
stated that in all these 260 cases the
charge was that of murdering whites, but
in 117 cases there was no legal evidence,
and in many no trial. The Chicago Tribune
challenges its Southern contemporaries
to name a case in those two years,
or in the past eighteen years, where a
white man has been lynched, or hanged,
or in any way troubled, for murdering a
negro. It is notorious that many ne
groes are killed by whites, and these figures
prove that the Southern people
not in the habit of punishing such crimes are.

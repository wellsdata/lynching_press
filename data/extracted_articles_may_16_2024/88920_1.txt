Sheriff Fenton is unable to get his
prisoners to Basin. It is said the same
mob that lynched Gorman and Walters
are sympathizers, and have declared
that Sheriff Fenton will never get out
of the locality alive with his prisoners.
Sheriff Fenton has wired the governor
of Wyoming for permission to use
the state militia at Lander, and also
has sent a telephone message to Basin
and other towns asking for volunteers
to assist him in, upholding the law.

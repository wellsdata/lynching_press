A LYNCHING AT BEDFORD, IND.
The Murderer of Conductor Prince
Hanged by a Mob.
BEDFORD, Ind., May 20 .-[ Associated
Press. At 2:10 oclock this morning a
mob of 100 men appeared before the
jail here, forced the sheriff to give up
the keys, and took John Terreli, who
murdered Conductor L. F. Prince at
Seymour, from his cell and hanged him
in the jail yard.
Terrell begged for his life, but his
met with silence. The
appeals were
lynching was conducted in a most orderly
manner, Terrell's cries being the
only sound heard.
After lynching their man the mob requested
that that the body be not taken
down until daylight, after which it dis-
pereed.
The mob hanged Terrell to a tree in
the jail yard within twelve feet of the
railroad track, so that all passing trains
this morning can see his body. He was
dressed as though he had been expecting
them. They completed the job at
2:50 o'clock.
There were forty- three men at the
jail masked and about fifty or sixty
etanding guard at different points over
the yard.
Terrell's crime was the murder of
Conductor L. F. Prince, of the Ohio
& Mississippi road. The assassination
was as cowardly as it was brutal. It
seems that Terrell tendered an old pass
when asked for his fare, which the conductor
refused. After an altercation
Terrell's father paid his fare for him.
Prince then left and was standing in
the door with his back toward Terrell,
who was closely following him, when
the latter fired twice, each bullet piere
ing the kidneys and passing forward
and out through the stomach of his victim
. Prince lingered a few hours, regaining
consciousness only within
few moments of his death. a

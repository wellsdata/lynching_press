LYNCHED BY A MOB.
Vengeance on a Negro Who Assaulted
a White Woman.
Marshfield, Or., Sept. 20. 1 Alonzo
Tucker, colored, who assaulted Mrs.
Dennis near Libby, Wednesday, was
lynched yesterday. A body of coal
miners heavily armed marched into
town Wednesday evening. The marshal
, who had Tucker in custody, at
tempted to take him from the jail just
as the miners entered and a rush was
made for the negro. He managed to
give his custodian the slip and jump
under the wharf into the mud flats and
eluded both officers and mob until yesterday
. The miners stationed armed
guards at every point of egress. Every
corner of the town was searches and
finally two boys located the fugitive
under Dean& Co.'s store. The boys
fired at him with air guns and drove
him from his hiding place. As he
emerged a ball from a rifle caught him
in the right leg. Tucker ran into
Dean's store and wa followed by the
miners, who started to string him up
in the store, but they finally decided
to take him to the scene of the crime.
A start was made but the negro died
from his wounds and the mob hanged
him to a beam on the South Marsh
field bridge. There was not a masked
man in crowd and everything was
done in the broad daylight.

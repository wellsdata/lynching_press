OLD Virginia was the scene of a
negro lynching at which Scott
Bishop furnished the corpse near
Norfolk Monday, for the assault and
robbery of a white man. Texas don't
seem to have any extensive rights in
this kind of business. Lynch law is
wrong wherever winked at or per-
mitted. If the laws of the land are
not acequate for the punishment of
known offense, they should be
any made so, and lynch law abolished.

LYNCHING.
San Jose Herald: Yesterday in Ken-
tucky a man sentenced to twenty years
for criminal assault was taken out of
jail by a mob and lynched. Mob law
thus assumes to fix the character of
its execu-
penalty as well as to assure
tion. There is more lynching in the
South than in any part of the Union
and also more crime of the kind that
provokes lynching. the
Apparently
punishment does not fit the crime. Between
Southern lynching and Califor-
nia to enforce legal penalties
there failures is a hard choice to make.

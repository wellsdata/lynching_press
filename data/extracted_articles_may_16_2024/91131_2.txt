to make every effort to apprehend the
twenty- five members of the lynching
party which kidnapped Frank from
the Milledgeville jail late last night.

been offered for the arrest and conviction

the Governor's office that no application
for a reward had been made.
Gov. Harris telegraphed to- night
from Fitzgerald, Ga., where he is attending
the Georgia Confederate
Veterans' reunion, that he would start
immediately for Atlanta to personally
take charge of an investigation into
the lynching. He said:
" I am mortified and determined to
have the fullest investigation of the
entire affair. I intended to remain
in Fitzgerald over Wednesday, but
this horrible affair causes me to return
to- night to take such steps as
will immediately bring to justice
those who are guilty of this despicable
crime."
Members of the Georgia Prison Commission
were in the Milledgeville jail
when Frank was kidnapped. They have
investigated his seizure. They say the
prison officials are blameless, although
" the incident is regrettable."

talen

secnes in the field two miles from
Marietta, where it was found, was
placed on board a train at midnight
for shipment to Brooklyn.
After Frank's body was found some
of the 6,000 people who crowded around
to view it advocated public mutilation,
but after shocking scenes, of which
women and children were spectators.
calmer heads prevailed and the body
vas taken to a secret place in Atlanta
for preparation for shipment.

Frank's capture last night was accomplished
without the use of any violence.
except such as a dozen or more men
vented on Frank himself as they dragged
him out to the automobile.
Not a shot was fired; there was
struggle with any of the twenty- five
armed guards stationed at the prison.
It is true there was a show of violence;
half a dozen of the lynchers displayed
revolvers and shotguns and several of
the prison officials were handcuffed and
kept quiet under threats of being shot.
The twenty- five lynchers went about
their business calmly and without display
of any emotion except deadly seriousness
and for the prison officials this
was enough.
It was just before midnight when the
gang, in eight automobiles, whirled up
to the house of Warden James E. Smith,
Two guards were sleeping on his poren:
the four occupants of the foremost automobile
leaped out and seized these men,
taking possession of their rifles.
Warden Smith was inside his house.

The man who apparently was the
leader of the band called for the warden.
" Who is it?" called back Smith,
Ordered to Throw Up Hands.
The mob leader spoke some name
which Smith did not recognize and does
not remember, and Smith went to the
front door. He said later he carried a
lantern in one hand and had his revolver
in the other.
As he opened the front door half a
dozen revolvers were thrust toward him.
He was ordered to throw up his hands.
Loosing his grip on his revolver Warden

His wife, in her room upstairs, had

rushed down stairs, threw her arms

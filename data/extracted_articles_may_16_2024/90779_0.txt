PIONEER
COUPLE
FATALLY BEATEN
( Continued From Page One).
Shortly after
the
investigation a
negro
called" Battleax"
was picked
up on suspicion, but was released after
it was learned that he could not have
been in the
case.
Late in the afternoon
two deputies from the sheriff's
office
arrested a
man found near the
railroad
tracks at Six Points. This
man seemed to be under the effects
some drug or liquor and had blood of

blood proved to be from a" dope"
needle and not from outside causes.
Entrance to the Erhardt home was
gained through a window on the west
side of the kitchen. Holes had been
punched through the frame of the

whole frame was removed and placed
on the ground. The chisel used in
gaining entrance was found on the
ground beneath the window.
Went to Investigate
In the kitchen of the Erhardt home
was a table which stood by the window
. Hanging on the window frame
was a collander. It is thought that the
first man to enter the window had to
Use only half the window because of
the table, and struck the collander with
his shoulder, knocking it to the kitchen
floor. This alarming Mrs. Erhardt, it
is believed she arose and entered the
kitchen, leaving her husband asleep.
As she passed through the door of the
aitchen, it is believed one of the men
struck her, the blow striking her on
the back of her left shoulder and
knocking her to the floor.
While in that position it is believed
the man struck her several times with
the blunt jack, the blows landing on
her head and forehead. Those blows,
it seems, were not enough to make her
unconscious and she crawled to the
wall near the door, where marks show
that a blow was struck which did not
hit her, but smashed the wall. Pools
of blood in the center of the kitchen
and near this wall bear out the theory
that first blows struck did not render
Mrs. the Erhardt unconscious.
The attack on Mr. Erhardt is believed
to have been made while he was
asleep. He did not regain consciousness
and died without being able to
give any clue as to the murderous assailants
.

local officers, they state. The doors of
a walnut desk were pried off with a
screw driver, beds in all the rooms
were turned upside down, clothing
torn down in the closets, pictures
moved on the walls, and every nook
and cranny on the place was thoroughly
searched by the murderers in
search of money.
Until Albert Erhardt arrives it will
be impossible to determine the amount
of things taken by the murderers, if
anything. It is not thought by George
Erhardt that his mother had more than
$ 20 in the house at the time.
Neighbors living near the Erhardt
house stated yesterday morning that
they had heard noises early in the
evening but had paid no attention to
them. No one noticed anything unusual
about the Erhardt residence.
To Prevent Outory
A blanket and the clothing which
Mrs. Erhardt had taken off the night
before are thought to have been used,
after the blows were struck, to muffle
any outeries which she might make
during the ransacking of the house.
After the murderers had finished
searching the house, it is thought that
they unhooked the back screen door

was thrown away in the front of the
house and the water in the irrigation
ditch near the house will be emptied
today in an effort to locate the lathing
hammer. Following the departure of
the murderers, Mrs. Erhardt revived
sufficiently to crawl from the kitchen
to the bed where her husband was
rlying. From the pool of blood in the
kitchen to the bed in the porch are
the prints of Mrs. Erhardt's feet and
hands as sh struggled to reach the
bed. Mrs. Erhardt had two scars on
each side of the head, a large bruised
place on the shoulder and many minor
scratches and bruises on the arms.
Mr. Erhardt suffered four compound
fractures of the skull and his head
and face are covered with cuts and
bruises.
Family Well Known
An inquest will be held today by the
coroner's jury which was selected yesterday
morning.
Mr. and Mrs. Erhardt came to Phoenix
13 years ago for the health of their
daughter, Louise, who died shortly
after their arrival here at the age of
26 years. Mr. Erhardt was 64 years
old and Mrs. Erhardt was 58. They
are survived by Jacob Erhardt, Jr.,
aged 36 years at Central fire house,
George Erhardt, aged 29, deputy state
treasurer, and Albert Erhardt, aged 27
years, who is the engineer in charge
of the Lyman Dam project.
Jacob Erhardt, Jr., the eldest son, is
the owner of a large white bull dog
and only recently he pleaded with his
father to keep the bull dog at their
home for protection should a prowler
come about. Mr. Erhardt, Sr., said
no, that the dog might disturb the
neighbors and refused to permit his
son to bring the dog to the home.
No murder to equal this in cold-
bloodedness has been recorded in this
vicinity since that of the spring of
1917 when John Daly overtook a man
and wife in a motor car on the Flor-
ence road, murdered the man and attacked
the wife. Daly was captured
and was taken from the, county jail by
a mob and hanged on a telephone pole
near the division line of Maricopa
Pinal counties on the Florence road and.

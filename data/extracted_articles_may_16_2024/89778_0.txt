ALLEGED DOUBLE LYNCHING.
Two Men Reported to Have Been
Hanged by a Washington Mob.
SPOKANE, Wash., Dec. 23.- Several persons
who have come here from Colfax declare
that, notwithstanding all denials, a
lynching occurred there Sunday night or
Monday morning. It is asserted that Chad-
wick Marshall and John McDonald, the alleged
murderers of Orville Hayden, a prominent
citizen of Farmington, were taken
from the county jail by a mob and hanged
to trees near the town. According to this
story a press censorship prevails, and consequently
the facts have not been
ted to make their way to general notice permit-.

The city was quiet during the night
and there was no sign of trouble, a
heavy rain serving to keep people of
the streets. This fact was considered
a great aid to the authorities who had
taken precaution to guard against a
fresh outbreak of Sunday's rioting
which resulted in the lynching of a
negro, the death of one white man,
injury to many others, heavy damage
by fire to the county courthouse and
an atempt on the part of a mob to
lynch Edward P. Smith.
Mayor Mayor is Better.

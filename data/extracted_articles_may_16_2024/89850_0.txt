AN INNOCENT NEGRO
IS SHOT BY CRUEL
TENNESSEE OFFICERS
( Special to The Phoenix Tribune.)
KNOXVILLE, Tenn., August 28.
Georgia lynch law tactics were adopted
by Constable O. S. Gaines of Knox
county district, and his son, McKin-
ley Gaines; John Burchfield and
Will Howell, all white men, when Sam
Netherland, an ignorant and harm
less negro, was arrested by the con
stable last Sunday morning and taken
to a point ten miles east of Knoxville
and hung to a tree until life was almost
extinct and then cut down and
,
shot through the shoulder. This brutal
and inhuman treatment was accorded
Netherland, familiarly known
in the Bowery district as" Sleepy
Sam," by these savages in an effort to
secure a confession as to who stole a
five- gallon keg of whisky that had
been hid in the bushes near McMillian
Station.
Netherland told the following story
concerning the affair to a newspaper
" Constable O. S. Gaines and
reporter
.
his McKinley Gaines, John
son,
Burchfield and Will Howell, two other
white men, arrested me early Sunday
morning telling me that some one had
stolen a keg of whisky from its hiding
place near McMillian Station. Al-
though they did not produce a war
rant, they hauled me about in their
automobile, looking for others who
they suspicioned had taken the whisky
They arrested two other colored
.
men who drive taxicabs about the
eity and took them before Esquire
Dobson and procured warrants for
them, and they then decided to take
me to the Mascot jail, which is thirteen
miles from Knoxville. They
drove at a rapid rate to the woods
near Mascot and then got out of the
automobile, handcuffed me and pulled
out their pistols and told me I would
have to tell who got the whisky. I
repeatedly told them that I didn't
know anything about it, and each time
I denied having any knowledge of
the whisky they would curse me and
punch me with their pistols. At times
they would stick the barrel of their
pistol in my mouth and command me
to chew it. They sent to a barn and
procured a rope, and, coming back,
they sat down and each one practiced
tying a hangman's knot. They
finally put the rope around my neck,
pulled me up and there I hung until
I was unconscious. After they let me
down, John Burchfield actually took
a 41 derringer type pistol, aimed at
my left breast and fired. I only
turned my body in time to keep the
bullet from piercing my heart. The
bullet struck me in the shoulder.
After treating me in this manner, they
left me and Mr. Tom Cox, a white
man, came along and gave me money
to catch a train and come to Knox
ville."
The above story causes a chill to
run through the body of every law
abiding citizen of this section. Although
there is a law in Tennessee
against the transportation of liquor
in the state, this officer of the law
had knowledge of whisky being in the
district, and when it was stolen, possibly
by some member of the drunken
bunch that administered the inhuman
treatment to Sam Netherland, the innocent
and harmless negro, they employed
these lynch law methods in an
effort to secure a confession or some
information as to where their whisky
was.
Warrants were procured for each of
the men and Burchfield was arrested
at Sevierville, having fled to that section
following his action on Sunday,
and the other three men, Gaines, his
son, and Howell, were arrested at
their homes by Constable N. S. Simp-
son. They are charged in the war
rants, which were procured before
Esquire William Sellers, with felonious
assault. The case is being investigated
by the grand jury.
Attorneys W. F. Yardley and George
McDade, Jr. are representing Sam
Netherland.,
GEORGIA LYNCHERS
KNOWN TO GOVERNOR
The National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People has
hnnounced that two of the ringleaders
and fifteen other members of the
mobs that lynched negroes in Brooks
and Lowndes counties, Georgia, last
May have been named to Governor
Dorsey of Georgia. The information
was got by Walter F. White assistant
,
secretar yof the association, who
made a personal investigation. Mr.
White's findings were submitted to
Governor Dorsey on July 10 and a
copy was mailed to President Wilson.
Eleven Negroes Lynched
A summary of his report says.
" Instead of six victims of the mobs
which raged over Brooks and
Lowndes counties from May 17 to
May 22, eleven authenticated cases
were discovered during an investigation
of the circumstances surrounding
the killing of Hampton Smith, a
white farmer of Brooks county, Ga.,
and the wounding of his wife, near
Barney, Ga., on May 16, and of the
lynchings which followed.
" Press dispatches at the time
named Will Head, Will Thompson,
1
Haynes Turner, Mary Turner, his wife,
Eugene Rice and Sidney Johnson, the
last of whom had stated before he was
captured that he alone was implicated
in the affair, and that the five
who had previously been lynched were
not involved in it. Five additional
victims were found- Chime Riley, Si
imon Schuman, and three unidentified
negroes whose bodies taken
were
from Little River, just below Quit
man, Ga., about a week after they
had been lynched. Negroes of the
neighborhood told the investigator
that there were eighteen victims, but
no more than eleven could be authenticated
.
More than 500 negroes have left
the regions since the outbreak, so
that a number of negroes who were
said by acquaintances to have mysteriously
disappeared, could not be located
nor their whereabouts
ascertained
and are not included in the in-
vestiagtor's findings. Hundreds of
acres of once productive land are now
overrun with weeds and dozens of
farm houses and cabins, deserted by
their former occupants, despite the
threats involved in the statements of
the mobs that any negro attempting
to leave the region would be considered
to be involved i nthe killing of
Smith.
" Chime Riley was lynched and clay
turpentine cups, used
to catch the
gum when the turpentine trees are
cut, were tied to his body; the. body
as then thrown into River,
near Barney, Ga., on the Little Moultrie

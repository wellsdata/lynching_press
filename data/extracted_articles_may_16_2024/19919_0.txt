The next day the sheriff went out on the
range, arrested Navajo Frank and con
fined him in the city jail to await trial.
That night about 30 citizens of the town
held a secret meeting and determined to
take Navajo Frank out of the jail and
lyneh him. The report that the old man
Navajo Frank had roped had died from
the effects of the brutal treatment received
only made the citizens more determined
, to lynch the brutal half- breed.

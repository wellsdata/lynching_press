LYNCHING DOUBLE THE AFTER
NEGROES LEAVE CHARLESTON
Charleston, Mo., July 4.- An exodus in
the negro population of Charleston is reported
to be in progress, following the
double lynching on yesterday, when Rob-
ert Coleman and Sam Fields were hanged
by an infuriated mob for the murder of
William Fox, a Mississippi county farmer.
An investigation of the affair at the request
of Governor Hadley will be made
by the prosecuting attorney today.
Sheriff Gulp and his deputies, whom
he has
sworn in after the lynching,
threats were made were powerless against
the crowd which attacked the county jail.
No shots were fired on either side. In
the crowd which packed the courthouse
yard in front of the jail were many women
and children and the officers feared on
that account to resort to shooting.
On
the outskirts of the crowd were several
automobiles, their occupants standing on
the seats, the better to watch the attack
on the jail.
Seemingly the mob waited only for a
leader. About 4 o'clock in the afternoon
a man seemed to take charge and the
crowd rushed forward. A concerted rush
was made at the jail and in a moment
the front fence of the yard was trampled
down.
The sheriff and his men were brushed
aside. There was no turning back then,
even had the leaders been so inclined for
the hundreds in the rear were pushing
forward, shouting for the lives of the
negroes. A railroad tie was shoved forward
as a battering ram. The mob
with increasing rage as the door
shouted went down and the crowd pushed into
| the building. Another door was in the way.
This was smashed in a second and the
crowd surged upstairs to the second floor,
where the two negroes were confined.
Those in the yard- the women and children
- could hear the sounds of a sledge
hammer as the lock was knocked off the
cell door. In a few moments a shout announced
that the lock had been broken.
Coleman was dragged forth and lynched
in the jail yard, while the crowd cheered.
A man climbed up a tree and put one
end of the rope over a limb. The negro
was jerked up and soon swung clear of
the crowd. While Coleman dangled another
body of men rushed from the jail,
dragging and pulling the other negro, Sam
Fields. A rope was placed around his
neck, and the mob, shouting, started west
along Court street.
The negro said he would show the men
where he and Coleman had hidden the
revolver they had used in shooting Wil-
liam Fox, whose death the crowd avenged

p√°rley, decided to take the negro to find

shooting half a mile south of town.
After going part of the way the negro
told the captors he guessed after all" he
couldn't find the pistol.
A stop was made then and Fields was

was cut down by several persons, who
wanted pieces of the rope as souvenirs.
The crime which a mob avenged by
lynch law was committed about 10 o'clock
night. The motive of the at
Saturday tack was robbery.

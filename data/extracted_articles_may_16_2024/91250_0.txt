CAPT. STURGEON SHOT.- The Assas
in Custody- Capt. Sturgeon, commander
of the Diana, on his last trip
the Diana, passed up yesterday) and
while at Lake Providence, ordered two
skiff men, who attached their boat to
the stern of the Diana and insisted on
being towed up the river, to go away
and attend to their business, which
they refused to do. The Captain then
called the first mate to render him
assistance, when one of them drew his
revolver and leveled it at Capt. S. and
for a moment hesitated to shoot, when
his fellow skiffman repeatedly urged(
him to fire which he did taking deliberate
aim. The ball passed through the
right collar, of the Captain's coat just
below his neck- through his cravat, and
striking the batton of his shirt collar
which seemed somewhat to turn the
direction of the ball, entering the fleshy
portion of the neck on the left side, passed
out about 14 inches from the point
entrar.ce. The officers and crew of
the Diana succeeded in capturing the
fellows, one of whom, we learn, was
the saine Walker who killed two men
Kentucky. The crew were so enraged
at the time, that they were going
to apply Lynch law instanter but
E. L. Smith, the clerk of the boat, advised
to the contrary, saying the enptain
was not dangerously wounded, and that
would be better to allow the law to
take its. Better counsel prevailed, and
they desisted. Walker is said to be a
desperate character, and we hope justice
may be meted out to him. We are
very glad to state that Captain Sturgeon
is in a fair way of speedy-

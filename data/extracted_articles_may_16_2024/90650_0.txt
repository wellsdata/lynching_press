KANSAS NEGRO LYNCHED.
He Was Accused of Killing Bartender
at Wier City.
Wier City, Kan., Nov. 5.- Gus Mc-
Ardle, a bartender, was shot and killed
last night, and in less than two hours
his supposed murderer, George Wells,
a negro miner from Scammon, was
swinging to a telephone pole, the victim
of a mob, which had forcibly taken
him from jail.
Earlier in the evening McArdle and
Wells had some words in the saloon,
after which the negro left. Shortly afterwards
a shot was fired from across
the street, the bullet killing McArdle.
Wells was arrested on suspicion and
lodged in jail. A determined mob
formed quickly and marched to the jail.
Securing Wells without much trouble,
they dragged the frightened negro from
the building and strung him up to the
nearest telephone pole. Before the rope
was placed about his neck Wells admitted
he was with the man who shot
McArdle, but denied that he had
the shooting. done

bestial thing.
Protecting victims against such mobs is relatively
simple, compared with the problem of protecting
America from the mental disease which causes pe-
Fiodic lynchings. Protection of a mob victim depends
largely upon the integrity and courage of officials.
But protection of the country against mass insanity
depends upon conquering the barbaric survivals of
ignorance and superstition- a slow process.
Because these debauches often take the form of
Negro lynchings, it is assumed mistakenly that this is
a racial issue. It is not. Nor is it a sectional issue.
The mob insanity breaks out on the Pacific coast, in
the north, and in the east, just as in the south.
Whether the hysteria destroys a Negro in a backward
Texas town, or Sacco and Vanzetti in" cultured" Bos-
ton, the mental disease is essentially the same.
There is no reason for the rest of the country to
self- righteous toward Texas. The cure of this mental
be malady is a national problem.

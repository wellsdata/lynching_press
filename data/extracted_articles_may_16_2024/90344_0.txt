QUIET BEING RESTORED.
Memphis, Tenn. Dec. 26.- Advices
from Scooba, and Wahalak, Miss., tonight
, state that quiet prevails at both
towns, as well as throughout the sur-
rounding territory and the troops and
civilians are in complete control of the
situation. According to the most reliable
reports the disturbances of the
last few weeks in Kemper county were
not as serious as at first reported. The
trouble is attributed to the actions of
- a reckless mob which is searching for
the negro who attacked Conductor
Cooper aboard a Mobile and Ohio train
last Saturday, shot and killed Constable
O'Brien, and killed three negroes
and wounded several others.,

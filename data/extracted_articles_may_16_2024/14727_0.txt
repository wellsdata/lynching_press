SHOT BY A CRAZY MAN.
A New York Building Superintendent
Probably Fatally shot.
NEW YORK, Oct. 30- At 3:30 o'clock this
afternoon a crazy man named Thomas
Bradley shot and probaly fatally wounded
Frederick Matthies, superintendent of construction
of the new Postal Telegraph
building on Broadway. Bradley was
locked up in the city hall police station
last night as a suspicious character, but
was released this morning. Workmen
about the Postal building say he was loafing
around all day, hiding behind piles of
brick. In the afternoon
he came
out and said the police and Superintendent
Matthies
were trying to
murder him for stealing$ 500. Soon
after he stepped up to Matthies
and deliberately fired two shots into
his stomach. An infuriated mob quickly
gathered and the policemen had a difficult
task to get the murderer out. Workingmen
in the building and other members af
the mob wanted to lynch him. Bradley
hid behind a pile of cornice, revolver in
hand. The police fired a number of shots
and ordered him to come out. Bradley
finally came out on the run, and when the
policemen seized him fought like a wildcat
. It required a severe clubbing to subdue
him, and when the policemen finally
got him out he was a sorry looking sight.
He was taken to the station and the
dispersed. crowd

ATTEMPT AT LYNCH LAW IN CINCINNATI.- The Cin-
cinnati Times contains the following particulars of an
affair which took place in that city:
" A few days since a Mr. Warren, of Memphis, Ten-
nessee, having in his company a male slave, whom he
had raised from childhood, arrived in this city and
stopped at the Dennison House. The slave is a large
fine looking man, and well dressed, and we are informed
, enjoys perfect freedom at home, where he conducts
a large barber shop.
Last evening, he, with an old acquaintance, visited
the Dumas House, a hotel for colored people, on Mc-
Allister street between Fourth and Fifth streets. He had
not been there long before he was invited to a room in
the upper part of the building. Not suspecting any
thing wrong, he went up stairs. He was taken into a
room, and then informed that he was suspected of being
a" southern spy," and that the boarders about the
house had appointed a jury to investigate the charge.-
The door was fastened and guards stationed on the
outside to prevent interference with the proceedings of
the" committee." He was told that he would be at lib.
erty if the charge was not sustained but if proved true, te
would never inform on another fugitive slave.
The slave by some means conveyed information to
his master, of what was going on. Mr. Warren called
at the watch house and procuring the services of
Messrs Bloom and Campbell, proceded to the hotel.-
The officers made their way to the room, but were there
resisted and not allowed to enter. Most of the persona
about the house, were armed with pistols, and were
loud in their threats. The committee not being able to
sustain their charge, they vo untarily released their pris.
oner We have no doubt, from all we can learn
. of
the
affair, that foul play was intended the slave, and if we
are to believe all we hear, had the charge been
tained, he would have been lynched. sus-

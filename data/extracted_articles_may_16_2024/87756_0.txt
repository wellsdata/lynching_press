soldiers, after drinking some and indulging in a late supper
at a Blake street restaurant, at Denver City, Cal., proceeded
to a house of ill- fame, kept by a man named
Johnny Kingston and a woman who professed to be his
wife. They demanded admittance, which was refused.
They then pounded upon the door, when a man inside
called out that he would shoot the first man who entered.
They then broke a window, and started to leave, when
the man inside fired through the window and killed one
of the number- William Duffield, of Co. B, 1st Colorado
Cavalry. The other soldiers, who were new recruits, ran.
The man who fired the shot was named Joseph Kittery,
who gave himself up to the authorities At about 1 o'clock
in the morning, the Provost's Sergeant, with two men,
went to the house and took charge of the body until daylight
. By 8 Sunday morning a steady stream of
persons set in o'clock to look at the body find out the facts.

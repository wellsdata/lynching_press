FREMONT, June 18.- The preliminary
examination of Bradley, the murderer
of Patrick Hanlan, was held
yesterday and will be continued Mon
day. Several important facts were
developed that have not yet appeared
in print, chief among them being the
testimony of a woman of the town, at
whose house Bradley and his chum re
sorted some hours previous to the
murder. When Bradley and his
chum first visited Hanlan's store they
pretended to be members of the United
States secret service, and under this
false badge of authority searched the
store from cellar to garret for some
evidence of crookedness. When they
returned to the bar room they inform
dated Mr. Hanlan that he had attempted
to defraud the government, and that
$ 300 cash in hand would arrest the
wrath of the government, which would
come sure if they should file complaint.
Mr. Harlan became indignant and ordered
them to leave the store instantly
, which they did.
The evening following found Brad
ley and his chum carousing at a noted
house of ill- faute in the outskirts of
the town. Here the former made his
public boasts that he would have
MONEY OR BLOOD,
at the same time displaying a pistol,
and asserting that he must get at
least fifty dollars of the amount demanded
of Hanlon. Here, also, Brad
ley and his chum,( who appears to be
a non- combatant) wore the mask of
secret service detectives. This is the
fact, as given by one of the inmates
on the has
upset the calculations of the defense,
and they propose to put on the stand,
at an adjourned examination, Mon
day, a score of witnesses to impeach her
testimony and establish its falsehood.
The hopes of the defense, if they can
destroy the facts above related, are
centered in establishing a case of
shooting in self- defense. Mr. Grey,
the leading lawyer that
on side,
maintains that Hanlan fired the first
shot, that which pierced the door of
the saloon and lodged in the wall of
the house opposite, and is quite confident
that his client will be acquitted
at this examination. The accessory
in the case( whose name I am unable
to recall) has been bound over in the
sum of$ 500 to await the action of the
grand jury, and it is hardly possible
that the principal in the case can be
dealt with less leniently.
Hon. J. C. Cowin, of Omaha, has
charge of the prosecution, and will
leave Omaha for Fremont at five
o'clock Monday morning. Grey and
Cowin are well matched and will undoubtedly
give many exhibitions of
legal sparring before the case ends.
Pictures of his wife and child ornament
Bradley's cell and secure him
the usual amount of sympathy.
Sheriff' Gregg and his assistants
have been walking arsenals since the
capture of the murderer. It was
feared he would be taken from jail
and lynched. Their fears, however,
proved groundless, although hundreds
of the friends and acquaintances of
the murdered man poured into town
from the surrounding country, and
were strongly in favor of lynch- law,
if a leader could be found. A story
is told of the sheriff that he went so
far as to have his life insured to be
prepared for the worst
.
The property left by Mr. Hanlon is
valued at from$ 30,000 to$ 40,000.
An administrator has not been
appointed. Mrs. Hanlon is crazed
and the sympathy the
people is strongly with her. of

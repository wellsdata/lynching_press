Murderer Terrell Lynched.
An Associated Press dispatch dated 3 a
m. Monday, at Bedford, Ind., says: At
2:10 o'clock this morning a mob of 100 men
appeared before the jail here, forced
the Sheriff to give up the keys and
took John Terrell, who murdered Conductor
L F. Price
at Seymour
,
from his cell and hanged him in
the jail yard. Terrell begged for his life,
but his appeals were met with silence.
The lynching was conducted in the most
orderly manner, Terrell's cries being the
only sound heard. After
lynching
their man the mob requested that the
body be not taken down until day-
Right, after which it dispersed. The
Inob hanged Terrell to a tree in the
jail yard within twelve feet of the railroad
track, so that all passing trains this morning
can see his body. He was dressed as
though he had been expecting them. They
completed the job at 2:50 o'clock. There
were forty- three men at the jail masked
and about fifty sixty standing guard at
different points or over the city.

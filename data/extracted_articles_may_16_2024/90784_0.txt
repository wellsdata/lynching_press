THE COATESVILLE LYNCHING.
Court Holds No One Responsible For
Murder of Zachariah Walker.
The district attorney of Chester
county, Pa., has thrown up his hands
in despair, declaring it impossible to
get a conviction in any of the cases
growing out of the burning of Zack
Walker at Coatesville, and has caused
the last one of the several indictments
to be taken from the list. And Penn-
sylvania rightfully takes her place in
the line of mob and lynch law, says
the Pittsburgh Courier.
When it is remembered that simultaneously
with this action in Chester
county a southern grand jury returned
indictments against white men for a
southern lynching, the shame and disgrace
of Pennsylvania stand out all
the more prominently. There is no escaping
the shame.
The whole state must shoulder the
curse. Until a change of venue was
demanded and refused the public eye
was directed to Chester county only.
but the refusal of a petition to change
the venue, together with the failure of
a Chester county jury to convict a single
participant, spreads the infamy
throughout the state.
The rabble of Coatesville have sown
the seed. We have but to await the
harvest. Meanwhile let it not be forgotten
that the blood of Zack Walker
be required at the hands of white
will men.

IT WAS DISGRACEFUL.
San Francisco, Aug. 28.- One of the
most sensational incidents in the re
cent history of this city was the attempted
lynching of a negro," Dan'
Thomas, by Tennesse troops, near the
Presidio, last Monday. From the best
evidence obtainable. it appears tha'
the troops were aggressors from the
start. Two of them provoked a quarrel
with Thomas, and in the fight
which resulted the negro, who is little
more than a boy, struck one of the sol Â·
diers over the eye, cutting a deep
gash. Thomas fled to his humble home
near the reservation, followed by 2
howling mob of over a thousand soldiers
, mainly from Tennessee and Kan-
sas regiments. The scenes which followed
were most disgraceful. In the
attack on the little cottage, the soldiers
forgot they were men, and disgraced
the uniform they wore. The
aged mother of Thomas was kicked
and bruised. The windows of the
house were broken, the fence was demolished
, and doors were smashed. In
fact, the place was literally wrecked.
And when at last Thomas was induced
to come out, officers with drawn pistols
prevented the mob from killing
him. After it was all over and the
official inquiry was begun, the Tennes-
seeans began to see they had made a
serious blunder. They were deprived
of many liberties, and a double guard
was mounted about the The
camp.
Afro- American league has taken up
the matter, and in all probability the
Tennessee regiment's pay will be held
back to make good the loss sustained
by Thomas during the attack on his
home. Some of the soldiers, it is expected
, will be dishonorably discharged
from the army. The parents of
Thomas have filed a for$ 5,000
damages against the Tennessee claim troops.

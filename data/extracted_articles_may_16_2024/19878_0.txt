A QUIET SABBATH.
The presidential party spent a very quiet
Sabbath. The President and Mrs. Harrison
accompanied Mayor Sanderson and Mrs.
Sanderson to the First Presbyterian church.
The remainder of the day the President
spent in his room at the Palace hotel. Post
master General Wanamaker addressed the
Baptist Sunday school and Young Men's
Christian Association,
The President had a conference with
Brig, Gen. Ruger late this afternoon in re-
gard to the lynching of the murderer at
Walla Walla, Wash., by soldiers on Friday
night, and subsequently the President sent
the following telegram to the Secretary of
War at Washington:" The affair at Walla
Walla is very discreditable to the
discipline. If,
army as ap-
the mob was composed
pears,
of soldiers, you will order a court of inquiry
, and see that the responsibility for
disgrace is fixed, and that the guilty are
the brought to prompt trial."

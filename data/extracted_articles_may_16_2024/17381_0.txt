THE FRANKLIN LYNCHING
For as sure as Govan Ward was crazy, as sure
as the mob which lynched him was stripped of all
the senses of responsible men while they killed,
there will be no reason for the escape of those responsible
save feeblemindedness in the officers
charged with the duty of apprehending the lynchers
.
Franklin county is not so large a county that
any mob could assemble in daylight and take a
prisoner from the sheriff and a deputy without the
overwhelming probability that the sheriff or the
deputy would know some of the men. There were
no masks and no efforts on the part of the lynchers
to conceal their identities. Others in Louisburg
saw the men who lynched the negro. Everything
was done in the light of day and under the eyes
of men. The body was still hanging to the tree
when a jury empaneled by Coroner R. A. Bobbitt
took only five minutes to return the verdict which
is too familiar after lynchings, that the victim came
to his death at the hands of a party or parties un-
known.
If this case ends with that verdict then not only
win North Carolina be shamed by the killing in-
unity of a mob but convicted of feeblemindedness
on the part of its officials. If ever a crime was
committed which should be solved, this is it. It
will fail to be solved only if a forgetfulness or a
carelessness approximating idiocy appears in this
as it has in other cases of lynching.- News

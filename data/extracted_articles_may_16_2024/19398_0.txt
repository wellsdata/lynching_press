Is the matter of the Martinsburg Post
office, both sides were heard by the Senate
Committee on Post Offices and Post Roads,
and the prosecution did not make out its
case. The committee was satisfied that Mr.
Evans is a man of good character, and,
specifically, that he did not have a hand in
the lynching of the colored man or of any
man. But the failure to sustain the charges
ans; for though there is no poesible chance
for Mr. Wisner, he and his friends are deter
mined that Mr. Evans shall not be
master. post

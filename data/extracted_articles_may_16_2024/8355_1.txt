MIDDLETON, TENN., July 14th.
- Members of a mob of 100 or
more fought among themselves
for four hours as to whether to
lynch a Negro, Hugh Jones, or
bring him on to Middleton and
turn him over to the officers.
Outnumbered, the adherents of
law and order were routed, and
at daylight Jones was strung up
to a sapling. Jones had attempted
assault Miss Ora
Yopps, aged to 17.

Verdict.
A Lynching
At Charlotte, S. C., sthe other day, a
who had assaulted and fatally
negro
injured a Mrs. Smith, was captured by
a crowd of white people and lynched.
A day or two later the coroner summoned
a jury, the evidence of the cause
of the negro's death was produced and
the jury rendered the following verdict
:
" We, the jury, find that Tom Jones
came to his death by gunshot wounds
by parties unknown to the jury, obviously
by an outraged public acting in
defense of their homes, wives, daugh-
view of the
children. Inters
and
enormity of the crime committed by
said Tom Jones, we think they would
have been recreant to their duty as
good citizens had they acted other-
wise."
Such incidents as this nullify volumes

claimed by southern citizens and newspapers
that there is no condoning of
lynch law in the south, and that public
opinion deprecates it. The sentiment
of the south, it is asserted, is as much
punishment of
opposed to summary
crimes, whether committed by one race
or the other, as the sentiment of the
north ..
Yet here is a typical case of lynch
law; no trial allowed the victim; no
opportunity to bring evidence to prove
his innocence; he is seized, strung up
to the nearest tree and his body riddled
with holes; and a jury finds not
only that the punishment was justifiable
, but that the people who killed the
alleged assailant" would have been recreant
to their duty as good citizens
had they done ctherwise."
The only condition under which this
verdict is admissible is that lynch law
tends to discourage and prevent such
crimes, where the regular and orderly
processes of justice under the law do
not. But it is admitted that the history
of the south does not justify this
conclusion. Where lynchings have been

apparently maddened by
groes are
these race wars, and are worked into
a state of mind which makes them peculiarly
susceptible to suggestions of
outlawry and crime. The orderly, regular
and inexorable processes of the
law in the arrest, trial, conviction and
punishment of criminals are believed
to be the strongest deterrent that society
has discovered against crime.
This is the experience of the world,
and nothing has occurred to indicate
that it would be otherwise or is otherwise
in the south. The coroner's jury
at Charlotte presumably declared public
sentiment at that place when it
complimented the lynchers on the discharge
of a necessary duty. Is senti-
Iment favorable to lynch law throughout
the south, protests
to the contrary notwithstanding?

PATH WAR ON STILL AND NEGRO
MISSISSIPPI MOB LYNCHED ONE
New Orleans, Dec. 20.- Citizens of Gulf
Port, Miss., a lumber town about seventy-
five miles from this city, lynched one- negro
and are hot on the trail of three others as
a result of the cold- blooded murder of Town
Marshal W. E. Richardson there last night.
The negro lynched is not the one who did
the shooting, but had been arrested by a
posse that was pursuing the real culprit
and his raltives. The murder was the result
of a dispute between Alvin Lewis, a
Richardson. A large
negro, and Marshal
crowd, principally composed of negroes, surrounded
the men at the time, including two
sons of Lewis and two nephews both of
the latter bearing the same name- Henry
Lewis.
While the marshal's back was turned one
of the nephews pulled his weapon and tak-
deliberate aim fired into the marshal.
ing The bullet went through Richardson's heart
and he dropped dead. The crowd at once
scattered, and Alvin Lewis, his sons and
nephews, fled in the direction of Wolf river.
Bloodhounds were secured and the trail
taken up. Alvin Lewis was quickly overhauled
and sent under guard to Mississippi
City, where he was placed in jail. The
posse kept on its way and ran down one
of the nephews. The prisoner protested his
innocence, but was started toward Gulf Port
under an escort. When within a half mile
of Gulf Port the escort was overpowered
and the prisoner taken away and shot to
death. The posse is still pursuing the two
Lewis boys and their cousin. They are said
to be in the vicinity of Wolf river today and
their catpure is regarded as certain.
Intense excitement prevails at Gulf Port
and some hotheads are talking of moving
on Mississippi City to take out and lynch
old man Alvin Lewis. As a result of the
tragedy the negro church at Gulf Port was
burned night. Richardson was from
Meridian last, Miss.

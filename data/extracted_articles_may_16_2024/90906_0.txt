One hundred and fifteen persons
were mobbed and lynched in the
United States during the year of 1900,
an increase of eight over 1899, and
of the number thus dealth with 107
were Negroes, and according to The
Chicago Tribune only 18 were lynched
for rape and 13 for attempting to
rape, the others were foully murdered
for committing all kinds of minor
offenses. The lynching record of 1900
shows that this form of lawlessness
is on the increase instead of being
on the decrease and that the Christian
people who reside in this so- called
enlightened nation do not pay any attention
to the oft repeated expressions
of President MrKinley," that mob and
lynch law must not be tolerated in
great and highly civilized coun-
this try."

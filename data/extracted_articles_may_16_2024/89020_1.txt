Mob Bent on Lynching.
The mob was formed for the purpose
of lynching the negro Pierce, who was
with the missing murderer Charles on
Monday night and who shot Officer
Mora. In the fight with these negroes
Captain Day and Officer Lamb were
killed. A mass meeting was held
near the union depot at 8 o'clock, at
which inflammatory speeches were
made, those who tried to counsel moderation
being howled down. Then the
crowd marched up St. Charles avenue
firing pistols and beating negroes, ..nd
out Washington avenue to Douglass
Square, near the scene of the murder
of Captain Day. By this time the mob
had been increased to about 2,000.
Speeches were made and the crowd
started for the parish prison, chasing
negroes out of Poydras market, and
helping themselves pistols from the
second- hand stores to in Dyades street,

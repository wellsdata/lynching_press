" To Hell With the Constitution
!' Stands" Shouts South
Carolina Executive.
" HISS ME, I DON'T CARE."
Snaps His Fingers at Heads of
Other States, Who Storm at
His Speech in Conference.
RICHMOND, Va., Dec. 6.- A sweeping
resolution repudiating the remarks of
Gov. Blease of South Carolina in support
of lynch law was adopted by the
Governors' Conference to- day by a vote
of 14 to 4.
Gov.
Blease, defending himseli.
snapped his fingers in the faces of the
other Governors and declared that he
cared not one whit what the conference
did or left undone.
" Four times this morning has my life
been threatened for my utterances," declared
Gov. Blease.
" I was quoted yesterday as saying' t
hell with the Constitution.' I say now
to all the Governors of all the States
and to all the people of the Unite
States what I said then."
The conference hall was thrown into
an uproar.
The Governors of Alabama, Wyoming.
Missouri, New York, Maryland and Wis-
consin denounced the South Carolinian
in strong terms for his utterances.
The Governors of North Carolina.
Arkansas, Connecticut and Idaho voted
gainst the resolution.
The resolution adopted was introduced
by Gov.' Mann as an amendment to
the one offered by Gov. O'Neal of Aid-
bama. It reads as follows:
" Resolved, That it is the sentiment of
the Governors' Conference in session
at Richmond, Va., to- day that the
whole power of the several States
hould be used whenever necessary to
protect persons accused of crimes on
womanhood, against the violence of
mobs, and to provide for speedy, orderly
and impartial trials by courts of
competent jurisdiction, to the end that
the laws for the protection of life and
property be duly enforced and respected
by all the people."
DEATH- THREAT LETTER REPUDIATED
BY GOV. MANN.
" I hold in my hand, said Gov. Bleas:
when he rose to defend himself," the
fourth letter threatening my life I have
received this morning. It was handed
me just now by some one I did not
know and it was addressed to me in the
care of the Governor of Virginia."
" I know nothing of the letter, sir,"
etorted Gov. Mann of Virginia." I
never heard of it before; I did not receive
it; I know nothing of its contents
.
" It doesn't matter," continued Gov.
Blease" I speak nobody's opinion but
my own. The newspaper headlines have
misrepresented me. When I spoke yes-
terday about the marriage of Jack
Johnson of Chicago I did not say he
would be lynched in South Carolina; I did
say that the laws of my State forbade
the marriage, and I did say that I did
not know, if the marriage had been per.
formed in South Carolina, whether the
law protecting him would have been
possible of enforcement or not.
" Wow, what I want to say to you is
this: I don't care one whit whether you
adopt this resolution or not. You may
expel me for all I care. On the 21st
day of next January I will begin my
second term as Governor. On the 4th
of March, 1915, if God spares me, I will
be sworn in as a member of the United
States Senate. I snap my Angers at
your resolutions, for all the resolutions
and all the motions you may act upon
will not avail to keep me out.
" Long after many of you gentlemen
here to- day are resting in the retired
shades of private life, I will be reaping
the rewards of public service. Long
after you good Governors are no longer
Governors, the white women of South
Carolina will pray for me with their
arms around their girls, and will arise
from knees to kiss their husbands and
beg them to go to the ballot box and
vote for Blease to protect them from
their daily terror.".
faint round of applause rippled over

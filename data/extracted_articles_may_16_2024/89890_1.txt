JOPLIN, Mo.-J. Lawrence Heil, a
grocer of Picher, Okla., was rescued
by Sheriff Bob Frazier of Cherokee
County, Kan., from a mob which had
taken him from his store, carried him
across the Kansas line and was about
to lynch him near Baxter Springs,
Kan. Heil, it is alleged, attacked Mrs.
V. Barnett, wife of a Picher man, in
her home. She is the mother of a 3-
year- old child. Heil, now in jail at
Treece, Kan, denies the charge.

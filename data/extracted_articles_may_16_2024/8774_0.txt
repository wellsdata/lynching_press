Mr. Van Beuren in the character of
Philip Morrow in Edward
Governor
Sheldon's intensely dramatic play" The
face in
Nigger," has a situation to
which he is compelled to either truckle
to the mob or become decidedly unpopular
as a protector of a negro who
has committed the unmentionable
crime.
Pursued by a mob bent upon lynch-
flees to the Morrow
ing, the negro
old
plantation for protection, his
mammy" pleading with young Morrow
on her knees. The governor with
drawn revolver holds the crowd at
bay and tries to reason with them. To
their leader who stands ready with a
coil of rope over his arm Morrow says:
" I can understand down to the bottom
what you want to do and why.
and it's human nature- I can understand
that. But, for God's sake try
to jam down your feelings for a moment
and think. Remember that
to the crime
lynching is next worse
itself."
Finding that pleading has no effect
on the blood- thirsty mob Morrow
hurls defiance at them." There's not
a man in this state, I don't care who
he is," he cries," that could feel a
deeper horror and disgust for such a
crime and such a criminal than I, but
your men have elected
me
you and
governor of this state to uphold the
law and now by Heaven you can't stop
me doing it."
Mr. Van Beuren is deeply interested
in the proceedings at the governors'
conference at Richmond in the matter
of the race problem, because of his
role in" The Nigger."
" I am quite in sympathy with the
position taken by" Governor Morrow'
in the play," said the leading man today
." Granted that the crime committed
deserves the must severe punishment
under the law, there is no reason
: the world why another and per-
crime
haps equally as repulsive a
should be committed by a body of citizens
in defiance of law and order. I
quite agree with Governor Shafroth of
Colorado who says that one mob can
do more injury to society than twenty
murderers.
" Although I am quite familiar with
of Southerners in the
the attitude
question of lynch law, having lived in
below the Mason and Dixon line for
several years, I cannot understand the
position of the governor of a state
who makes such radical utterances as
those attributed to Governor Blease of
South Carolinna.
" To my mind it is not a question
called Southern chiv-
entirely of so-

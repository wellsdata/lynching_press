Great Excitement at Louisville.
Four negroes accused of murdering
the Joyee family some months since,
were acquitted in Louisville, Ky., on
Wednesday, one turned State's evidence
, but his testimony was not legal,
though corroborated. The acquittal
caused great excitement about the Court
House. A mob assembled with cannon
and placed it in front of the jail. A
number of shots were fired from the
jail and from the mob, and the jailer
fearing the escape of.the prisoners, formally
surrendered two of them, when
they were hung. The third took a razor
and cut his throat. The negro who
turned State's evidence was unmolested.
The disturbance continued on Thurs-
day night, and the remaining negro of
the four accused of the murder of the
Joyce family, who had informed upon
his comrades in crime, was also taken
from the prison and hung. This completes
the awful tragedy, three having
been hung by the mob, while the
committed suicide to escape lynch fourth law.

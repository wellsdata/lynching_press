AFTER NEGRO MURDERER
NORTH CAROLINA POSSE
Charlotte, N. C., October 7.- Supt. R. H.
Eubanks of Lane Bros. Co.& Jones, contractors
on the double tracking of the
Southern railway, was shot and instantly
killed by Oscar Gaddy, a negro, at the
railway camps near Lexington. The deed
was committed without provocation. Eu-
banks had gone to the camp to quiet
negroes, who were raising a disturbance the,
many of them being under the influence of
whisky. Gaddy escaped. A posse of armed
men numbering two hundred, with
blood hounds, are scouring the country
for him, and if caught he will probably
be lynched.
A similar tragedy occurred in this vicinity
recently when Foreman Beacham was
shot and killed by a negro, who is
sentence to hang this month. under

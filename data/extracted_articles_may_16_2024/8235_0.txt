SNOWSTORM.
NEW YORK'S
[ From the New York Tribune.]
When New York woke up last Wed-
nesday morning five or six inches of
snow enfolded the wind swept city and
the big flakes were whirling and flying
in a mad endeavor to wrap every available
spot in softest, purest white. The
winds were holding high carnival with
the snow elves, and by noon the drifts
were anywhere from two to five feet
high and seven inches of snow had fallen
.
The trees and foliage in the parks
and squares presented beautiful pie-
tures, and all that was old and dark
and unsightly had been silently but
surely snowed under by the first storm
of winter.
People did not mind the weather. The
streets showed many passers, from the
white haired old man with snow of age
in his locks, to the rosy cheeked child
whose shining curls floated over his
shoulders in all the gleaming gold of
sunny youth.
But there was no aimless strolling.
Walking was spirited and rapid, and
the children's merry feet flew over the
snow as light as the flakes themselves.
and still the storm whirled and whistled
and the gray clouds clustered over the
city in snow filled splendor.
By 4 o'clock a lull had come. The
last snow flake had fallen and the great
white storm had sung itself to sleep.
Every landmark was wrapped in gleaming
beauty and the city looked like a
poem carved in crystals.
There is no danger of Gen. Coxey going
to Cuba.
Kentucky people celebrate the holiday
season with a lynching a day.
Senator Tillman appears to have broken
the andle of his pitchfork.
Lynching negroes bids fair to supersede
horse racing as a Kentucky past-
time.
In this Cuban affair Mr. Cleveland
shows a disposition to check the bet to
McKinley.
While she is in town it might be well
for the Boston people to get Queen Lil's
opinion of the Bacchante statue.
Dr. Parkhurst is causing a great
many New Yorkers to dislike Joseph H.
Choate for the enemies he hasn't made.
Mark Hanna is said to be suffering
from headaches. Well, it's a pretty big
strain to run a country like the United
States.
If Mr. Bayard, as reported, is even too
English to suit Mr. Cleveland, it must
be that he has sworn allegiance to the
queen.
Mr. Bryan is said to be tired of lecturing
. Mr. Bryan will show judgment
uncommon among lecturers if he grows
tired before the people do.
Some people will devote themselves
this week to being as bad as they can.
SO they will have something really
worth swearing off New Year's.
The manner in which Boston street
railway officials treated the strikers'
representatives is too much like the
way the Spanish treated Maceo and his
band.
New York makes changes but she
never improves her rotten political condition
. She is now about to elect Platt
to succeed Hill in the United States
senate.
The report that Mark Hanna can't
sleep nights gives rise to the suspicion
that he is trying to think how he will
get even with the congressional library
committee.
Most of the fighting in the Cuban war
seems to be done in the United States
senate. There is a perceptible decrease
of war sentiment since the holiday recess
began.
After Dr.Parkhurst opened up a fight
on" Boss" Platt the boss's chances for
election to the United States senate
seem to have fairly boomed. It is now
said that all but six of the Republican
members of the legislature will vote for
him as the successor to David B. Hill.
Parkhurst may cause the six to turn
before the election occurs.
Senator Hoar has joined the ranks of
the" repudiators." He suggests that
some of the debts owed to England be
paid in silver as a means of forcing
that country to join in an international
agreement for bimetallism. The Lynn
election must have had some effect on
the old gentleman. But the horror
it! Pay our foreign debts in silver! of

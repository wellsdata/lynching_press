LYNCHING AGAIN IN VOGUE.
For a time the lynching spirit
seemed to rest but it has broken
out afresh in all of its priestine
horrors. Nob violence for the past
two months has been in full swing
and the object in each case of the
mob's wrath has been the Negro
whether innocent or guilty it makes
no difference. First, the mobo-
cratic rage enacted at Springfield,
Ohio, where two colored men were
killed and the homes of over a
hundred innocent colored villagers
fired. Then Edward Johnson of
Chattanooga, Tenn., under a stay
of execution from the U. S. Supreme
court was taken from the
county jail by a mob and hanged
in utter defiance of the highest tribunal
of the land and now comes
the State of Missouri, the home of
the Reform Governor Folk and on
Easter Sunday Eve, two innocent
victims perhaps three were made
to suffer the death penalty in the
most violent manner. These
deaths involve the question of trial
by jury, right, law and order the
very foundation stones on which
the government is built. As a
chain is no stronger than its weakest
link so no government is stronger
than its weakest law. Judged
by this both the U. S. Supreme
court and the State Constituted
authorities are very poor protection
* their subjects. All of this is
ng anarchy and some day the
will be directed from
and property of
will follow
sowing the
follow. whirlwind certain to the
state and nation is bound to reap
Rev. Tolson preached a splendid
Sermon. Sunday afternoon, Mrs.
White and Miss Lott who worked
faithfully with the children rendered
a splendid program. Sunday
night the adults acquitted them-
grandly with an interesting
selves program.

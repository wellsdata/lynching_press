Georgia Slips Back
Lynchings, once common throughout the south,
have been decreasing steadily in number during recent
years. Not more than ten or twelve persons met
violent death at the hands of mobs in the last year,
whereas just before the turn of the century victims
were counted by the score.
The latest lynching in Georgia therefore will
come as a shock to those who had hoped that this
most horrible of all forms of murder was passing.
That is particularly true because there has not been
a lynching in that state within three years, in spite
of the intense racial feeling that sometimes develops.

and his body burned on a pyre of logs. If telegraphic
accounts are correct, the mob exhibited unusual
barbarity.
According to the sheriff, the Negro had confessed
to the crime. There is small doubt that if law had
been permitted to take its course, he would have been

punished to the limit without delay.
After Georgia's last lynching, seventeen men were
indicted and sixteen were sent to prison. It is to be
hoped the authorities will display equal zeal in the
instance, thereby serving notice that rule of
present lynch law is not to be resumed.

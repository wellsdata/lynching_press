LEXINGTON, Ky., Oct. 15.- Another
lynching was added to the unusually large
fall series of Blue Grass lynching bees yesterday
. On Saturday at the close of the
Beattyville fair Oscar Morton, a prominent
citizen of Stanton, in Powell county, went
on the warpath. Only two weeks ago
Morton killed a man at Stanton, and was
out on$ 5,000 bond to appear next week at
the Powell eircuit court.
When Morton arrived at the fair he proceeded
to get drunk, and then went to
hunt for Sheriff William Simms, who was
his deadly enemy, a feud of long standing
existing between the two men. Simms
and Morton met near the entrance to the
fair grounds, and after a few words both

I of them drew revolvers and a quick exchange
of shots followed, Morton using and
two revolvers. His first shot broke the at
sheriff's right arm at the elbow, and John
Hogg, a friend of Simms, whipped out his
gun and, joined in the battle. When the cure
smoke had cleared away it was found that cure
Sheriff Simms was dead, having a shot ather
through his breast, one in his abdomen ing
and another in his arm.
Morton was shot through the neck, lain
while Hogg was unhurt. Before a crowd been
could collect Morton was hustled to the
county jail and placed under guard. A
big meeting was at once held in the public
square. Colonel John Drummond mounted
a barrel and made a speech, in which he
said the murderer must be hanged, but
it must be done quietly and with perfect eures
order. Morton had killed two men in less
than two weeks time, and he must die by
the rope.
A mob was quickly formed and marched
to the jail. The jailer was overpowered
of and the keys to Morton's cell obtained. He
was found lying on the floor of his cell,
and after a bitter struggle was seized and
to dragged out. He then became impudent,
told the mob that he did not care what
they did with him, provided they did their
work quick. After a short parley he was
taken to a little bridge some distance from
the town, and the rope was placed around
his neck. The leaders drew their guns and For

Mobile, August 29.- Between 10 and 11
o'clock tonight a mob of about 500 persons
attempted to lynch William Thomp-
son, colored, confessed assailant of
two little white girls and one little negro
girl. The mob broke into the jail yard
through the big wooden gate and filled the
yard, the sheriff's deputies meeting them
at the door armed with Winchesters,
which they discharged, with ink cartridges
over the heads of the mob, no one
being hurt.
A committee of the mob then admitted
to the jail with the assurance being given
that the negro was not there. The mob
then dispersed.
Will Thompson, the negro whom the
mob sought to lynch tonight, was taken
out of jail ten minutes before the mob
arrived and put on a train for
ham. Birming-

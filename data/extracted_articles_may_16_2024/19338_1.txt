A CRIMINAL LYNCHED.
A Colorado Murderer and Thief Lynched
by Indignant Citizens.
CANON CITY, Col., Dec. 5.- At four
o'clock yesterday morning twenty armed
men succeeded in effecting an entrance to
the jail here, overpowered the sheriff and
tore down the steel cage in which With
erill, the murderer, was confined. The
prisoner broke up his bed and with a portion
of the frame knocked several of the
mob down. Three shots were then fired
by members of the party and Witherill
fell to the floor with his shoulder shattered
. He was immediately carried a
short distance from the jail and strung up
to a telegraph pole, without resistance,
and left hanging until daylight. Witherill
never said a word after being wounded
and appeared most indifferent as to his
fate. Harry Perdue, another murderer
confined in the jail, was not molested.
In 1872 Witherill murdered his employer,
a sheep man named Wall, living in Elbert
County. He was arrested and sentenced
for life, but was pardoned a year ago. In
September he started from Ironton, a
small town in the southern part of the
State, for Silverton, with two acquaintances
. He arrived at Silverton with the
teams belonging to these men, but the men
were never seen or heard of. There was
no evidence to convict him of killing the
men and he was never arrested. From
there he went to Pueblo, sold the horses
and became acquainted with Charles Mc-
Cain, and the two started from Pueblo for
this place in October last with two teams
belonging to McCain for the purpose of
hauling ore. Witherill appeared in Den
ver where he attempted to sell the teams
that belonged to McCain and was arrested.
McCain's body was a week later be
tween here and Pueblo found buried in the sand.

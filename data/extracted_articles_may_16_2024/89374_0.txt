TELLS STORY OF
BOY'S LYNCHING
Cameron, Tex., June 24.- That the
Mexican boy lynched at Thorndale Mon-
day night was But 13 or 14 years old and
that he weighed less than fifty pounds
was the statement made here today by
Judge E. F. English, who yesterday conducted
the executive inquiry into the
lynching. The boy was lynched after
killing a man who cursed him. Judge
English said the lynching was done by
half a dozen men and that the report
that the" best citizens of Thorndale"
participated in the lynching was untrue.
" The boy was passing the saloon of
N. H. Stephens, whittling upon a shingle
. The proprietor spoke to him good
naturedly about littering the sidewalk
and Stephens and the boy were scuffling
in play when Charles Zieshang said to
the boy:
If the d- d little
ever comes
down in front, of my. place of
whittling on shingles, I will whip business the
" This language aroused the youth and
he instantly sprang at Zieshang, stabbing
him one time just below the collar
bone, from which he died in a few minutes
."
Judge English said that five or six men
later went to the house where the boy,
under arrest, was awaiting transportation
to jail in Cameron. The boy wore
a chain padlocked around his neck by
the constable, who had arrested him,
and who was then out looking for an
automobile. These men, the judge said,
led or dragged the boy by this chain,
pulling him' along behind a horse. He
was in a dying condition when he reached.
the place where he was finally hanged.
Judge English said that many of the
leading citizens of Thorndale had COoperated
with him to secure all the facts.
The examining trial of the accused
men will be held in a few days in
eron. Cam-

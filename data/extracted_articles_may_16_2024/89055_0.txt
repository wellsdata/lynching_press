Indianapolis, Ind., Nov. 24.- Gov.
Durbin has ousted from office the
sheriff of Sullivan county, who permitted
a mob to take from him James
Moore, a negro prisoner, and lynch
him. The lynching occurred in Oak-
town. The negro had been arrested
for assaulting the wives of two farmers
. When a grim looking mob appeared
and demanded custody of the
prisoner the sheriff made no resistance
and Moore was taken in hand and
while he begged and prayed for mercy
a rope was placed around his neck and
he was hanged. The lynching occurred
shortly before a company of
militia, hastily dispatched to Oaktown
reached the scene of the mob's violence
. As soon as the matter was
brought to the attention of Governor
Durbin he issued the order
the sheriff of his authority. relieving

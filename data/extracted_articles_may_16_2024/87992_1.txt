a mile from Gibson Station, Richmond
county, Christmas night. The man
lynched was Jim Green, colored, a new
comer in the neighborhood who was
employed in a cotton seed oil mill at
Gibson. Nothing was known of him
that he bad
except was of
reputation and had served time
in the penitentiary. Late Christ-
mas night a number of white
men on horseback surrounded Green's
house, and made him go with them one-
half mile down the road, when they
drew revolvers and riddled him with
bullets. The lynchers were masked
and were strangers. It is supposed
they came from South Carolina and
lynched Green for some committed

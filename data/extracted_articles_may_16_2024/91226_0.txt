The Powhatan Advertiser has the following
in relation to the man who was pursued
ftom Tennessee and hung in this State:
" The man who was found hanging to a tree
near Grand Glaize, in Jackson county, a week
or so ago, has of course been properly buried
by the good citizens of that neighborhood .--
We are like our neighbor of the Balance, opposed
to being hanged in any way -- but if hung
we want no labels on our back. We would
like to know what is the difference between a
horse thief' and a' Tennessee horse thief." --
This man when found was marked and labeled
' Tennessee horse thief,' and if a Tennessee
horse thief what jurisdiction had Arkansas over
him, admitting the justice of lynch law? Ar-
kansas horse thieves had better look out
in Tennessee or they will be labeled." when

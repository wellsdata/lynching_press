Negro Lynched for Theft of 75 Cents.
Macon, Ga.- Passengers on the Centra
! of Georgia train, coming through
Byron, Ga., brought an account of the
named John
lynching of a negro
Wilkes, at that place Sunday night.
The negro robbed two small boys of
75 cents. When Marshal Johnson
made an effort to arrest him, the negro
attempted to shoot the officer.
Quick work prevented this, however,
and a general mix- up followed, with
the result that the negro was arrested
and locked up. At a late hour,
unknown persons dragged the prisoner
from the jail, and after carrying him
a short distance, the body was riddled
bullets. It was then burned upon
with a log fire prepared for the occasion.

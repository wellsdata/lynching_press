Danville, Ill., August 3.- James Wilson,
a negro whom a mob attempted to lynch
on July 25, causing a race war, was today
indicted by a grand jury on a charge of
attempting to assault Mrs. Burgess of
Alvin, Ill., and sentenced to a long term
in prison. The whole proceedings occupied
about two hours. The grand jury
was convened to look into crimes committed
during. the mob outbreak in which
Metcalf, a negro, was hanged and burned
for murdering Henry Gatterman. Judge
Thompson instructed the grand jury to
begin at the bottom. Wilson's case was
taken up first and he was indicted in a
few minutes. Sheriff Whitlock, who defended
Wilson against the attack of the
mob, took Wilson into court as soon as
the indictment was returned.
The sheriff
hustled the negro into court in a rough
manner, threatening to help him by force
if he continued to lag. Wilson's guilt was
established by his confession, sentence
was passed and the criminal was dragged
back to jail.
The grand jury tomorrow will take up
the cases of the men arrested for
part in the mob outbreak. taking

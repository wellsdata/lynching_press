When the National Association for|
the Advancement of Colored People
holds a convention up in Washing-
ton- in such high consideration are
they held by the imperialist oppres-
sors of the Negro masses that Luther
Reichelderfer," big chief" of the
Board of Commissioners, gives them
" the key to the city."
Not only are these betrayers of the
Negro masses welcomed and feted by
the lynch class, they are also addressed
by one of its spokesmen, Sen-
ator Arthur Capper of Kansas.
Did Senator Capper speak to this
gathering of misleaders about the actual
miseries and lynchings of the
Negro masses? Not at all!
But he did tell them that every
Negro should be against the immigration
of foreigners. He did lyingly
proclaim that since the immigration
laws were tightened the economic
condition of the Negro was" better."
And Senator Capper, like all hypo
erites before him, then proceeded to
tell his audience of bourgeois
groes- how good natured the Negro Ne
race is, how true he is to" his country
," that as a race he has made
" wonderful progress," and that by
having faith in their" leaders"( the
lynch class) and by being patient,
obeying the capitalist laws, thet they
would finally reach the" top."
Then, with the slimiest kind of
fakery, Senator Capper" regretted"
the lynching of Negroes.
Not a word about the nine innocent
Scottsboro boys condemned to
die. Not a word about the Jim
Crow system of the white bosses. No
word about the thousands of Negro
and white workers and farmers starving
because capitalism has deter
mined that they starve.
Senator Capper told the N.A.A.C.P.
jokes instead, the usual tripe at all
capitalist conventions. and, by deliberately
ignoring the real issue, he
gave them the assurance that he will
co- operate in keeping the masses in
misery- that he will abide by the
capitalist lynch law.
On this note, first day of the
N.A.A.C.P. convention the ended.

NINE NEGROES LYNCHED.
Prisoners Taken From Officers and Hanged
by Masked Men.
NEW ORLEANS, Oct. 1.- An Helena
( Kans.) special says: There has been considerable
excitement here to- day over a rumor
concerning the warfare caused by a body of
imported cotton- pickers inciting negroes to a
general strike for higher wages, which has
culminated in a riot. To- day Deputies Frank
Mills and Jesse Hodges, who have been with
the Sheriff the last few days, arrived in the
city, and they reported that yesterday afternoon
they succeeded in locating thirteen of
the worst of the rioters in a canebrake near
Cats Island. The posse called upon them
to surrender, and they made reply by
a volley of shot, and a dash to escape. Two
escaped, two were wounded and nine captured
. The captured negroes were disarmed
and given in charge of Deputies Mills and
Hodges, who started with them to Mari-
ana, the county seat. Near Hinckleys
Landing a crowd of masked, mounted and
armed men surrounded the deputies and the
prisoners, demanding the latter from the
former. The crowd took the prisoners from
the deputies, marched them into a thicket
and hanged them. It is believed most of the
negroes were from Memphis. Among the
killed is Ben Patterson, an all- around negro
gambler, who organized the strike on behalf
of the cotton- pickers who go annually from
Memphis to the bottoms. The balance had
nothing to do with the disturbance. The
impression is that the trouble is en-
general tirely over.

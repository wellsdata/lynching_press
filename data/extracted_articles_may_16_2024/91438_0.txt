A MURDERER LYNCHED.
Summary Vengeance Dealt a Negro
in Tennessee- His Body Riddled
with Bullets.
FRANKLIN, Tenn., April 30.- The city
was crowded with negroes yesterday, the
occasion being the performance of a ten-
cent circus. One negro, Jim Taylor,
became troublesome and shot
very
Policeman Charles Cook, who was trying
to arrest him. He also shot one of the
circus men. He was afterward
jailed. Last night a well organized mob
attacked the jail, overpowered the
sheriff, secured the keys and quietly took
the negro down a side street to a covered
bridge and hanged him to a crossbeam.
His body was riddled with bullets. The
mob then dispersed. Most of the mob
came on horseback. The negro's attack
on Policeman Cook was particularly atrocious
, as he had him face downward and
caught hold of his shoulder and shot
then him in the back of the neck.

THE NEW YORK MURDER.
The Identity of the Ripper Established
Earlier Reports Substantiated
by Inspector Byrnes A
Strong Chain of Circumstantial
Evidence.
NEW YORK, April 30.- Inspector Byrnes
this afternoon substantiated the story
given out this morning as to the identity
of the Ripper. The inspector does not
a
say positively that" Frenchy No. 1" is
the murderer but he gave a strong chain
of circumstantial evidence that leaves no
doubt but that he is the man who committed
the crime.
He discovered, he
said, that Frenchy was with the woman
" Shakespeare" on Wednesday night and
slept with her in the East River hotel.
During the following day he was in her
company nearly all day. On Thursday
night about midnight" Shakespeare"
left the barroom, where she and
Frenchy were drinking and a little later
she was seen to go up stairs with a strange
man. Soon afterwards Frenchy asked
for a room and was assigned to one directly
opposite that occupied by" Shake-
speare When Frenchy was arrested he
had on no under clothing. He wore a
coarse shirt, a pair of dirty trousers and a
pair of filthy socks. Blood was discovered
on the shirt. On the floor of the hallway
between the rooms occupied by the Brown
woman and Frenchy, several spots of
blood were discovered. On the inside of in
the door of Frenchy's room were blood
marks. The blanket in the room had
clots of blood upon it as if a person had
wiped his hands upon it.
The inspector says Frenchy No. 2 was
to
arrested early Sunday morning, but it
was discovered that he had spent the
night at a place nearly five miles distant.
Late this afternoon a mysterious prisoner
was brought before District Attorney
Nicholl. Later he was removed, to police
headquarters. This man answered to the
description of the man who rented the
room at the East River hotel with the
of
woman, Brown. It was afterward ascertained
that his name is Joseph Franks
and that he is an Arabian.,

" May South Carolina now punish
the mob that lynched the Lowman
Negroes. All honor to Judge Reed
of Georgia for his courageous main-
tainance of the law in the recent Georgia
lynching case.
" The southern states are still at
bottom of the
statesmenship of men like Carter
Glass and Oscar Underwood. There
is a South that practices and justifies
lynching and another South that believes
it is unjustifiable under any and
circumstances, and is resolutely de-
all termined to put an end to it.

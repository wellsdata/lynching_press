A terrible lynching for a horrible
crime took place this week on the
Gulf coast of Mississippi, and a
Young negro was lynched at Devall,
West Baton Rouge parish, for inciting
the negroes to rise against the
whites, and for alleged complicity in
the foul assassination of a young
man by another negro who has
white made his escape.

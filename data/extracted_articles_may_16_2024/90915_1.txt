" These men not only disgrace them-
selves- they cast indignity upon our
laws, they shame the state of their
birth or adoption. Crime must not go
unpunished. But to punish one crime
by another is the practice of barbarism
, not civilization. The lynchers of
Belleville belong to the dark ages.
They are a disgrace to our splendil
law- abiding state of Illinois.
" Nor it is without significance that
the victim was a Negro. The Negro
to be creeping
phobia frenzy seems
north of Mason and Dixon's line.
Lynching Negroes south of it is so
common as to cause no northern comment
. But now the red evil is invading
our own borders. What is the end to
be? No state or nation can countenance
horrors and morally survive
." such
Lynchers of Belleville Are Denounced
by Rev. R. A. White.
" The men who lynched the Negro
are like their own deed. They belong
to the law- defying class. They have the
hearts of savages and the cruelty of
brutes," declared Rev. R. A. White of
the Stewart. Avenue. Universalist
church last Sunday in a prelude to his
referring to the lynching at
sermon Belleville.

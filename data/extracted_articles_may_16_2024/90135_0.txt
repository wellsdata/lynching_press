RACE WAR IMPENDS
IN OKLAHOMA STATE
Following the Lynching of Negro Near
Durant.
--
Durant, Aug. 14.- The circulation report
that another white woman had
been assaulted by a negro near Haskell
this afternoon and that fifty armed
negroes had captured a southbound
train on the Missouri, Kansas and
Texas road headed for Durant, follow-
ing closely the death of Mrs. Redden
Campbell as the result of an assault
and the burning of the body of the
negro who assaulted her, threw this
section into a fevor of excitement this
afternoon.
An investigation, however, proved
both stories untrue. No other woman
had been assaulted but the negroes
did capture a train at Atoka and kept
possession until Caney was reached.
Five hundred armed men here waited
the arrival of the train. Conductor
tonight said the negroes were
McGee gathering in large forces at Caney.

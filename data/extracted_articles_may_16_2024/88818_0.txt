Texas Freeman: It seems
strange that the government of
the United States wants to interfere
with Spain and Turkey for
the maltreatment of the Cubans
and American citizens in Armenia
who are thousands of miles
away, and will not pay the least
attention to the states within its
own borders where American citizens
are burned, skinned alive
lynched contrary to law near-
ly and every day in the year.

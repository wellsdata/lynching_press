ST. LOUIS, June 12th.- A special from
Jackson, Miss., to the Post- Dispatch says:
George Beckett, a negro, attempted to outrage
the seven- year- old daughter of a man
named Agnew, in Monroe county, yesterday.
A party of citizens, with shotguns and bloodhounds
, started in pursuit of the brute, and
he was run down near Tombigbee river. He
refused to surrender, and defied his pursuers,
who opened fire on him, wounding him seriously
. He was then taken to jail and a guard
placed over him. At night a crowd overpowered
the jailer, broke into Beckett's cell,
dragged out, and hanged him to the limb
of a tree him.

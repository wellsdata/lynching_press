OUTRAGE IN ANNE ARUN-
ATTEMPTED
DEL Annapolis, June 14 .-- While the
coroner's jury was hearing testimony
at the county jail to- day as to the lyncli-
ing of the negro Sims for an outrage
on Miss Jackson officer Jubb arrived at
the prison with William Thomas, colored
, charged with attempting an out-
Stinchcomb,
rage upon Miss Henrietta
a white lady, living in the third district
of this county. It is stated that yesterday
about sundown Miss Stinchcomb
was passing through a piece of woods
on her way home from visiting a neigh-
bor, when Thomas grasped her, but
she escaped and was pursued by him.
Thomas once made a similar attempt
upon a little white girl about fourteen
years old, but was not arrested for it.
The prisoner is about twenty- five years
old. This attempt, happening so soon
after the Odenton outrage and the subsequent
lynching of Sims, has created
a profound sensation here. Sheriff
Carr fears another demonstration by
lynchers, and State's Attorney Revell
has ordered hira to use the whole body
of the county as a posse to prevent
another exhibition of lynch law Balto.

Colored Miner Lynched.
CHEROKEE, Kan., April 24.- Frank Ha-
man, a coal miner, living with his family
near the Schwab mines, is dead at his
house, half a mile east of the mines, at the
hands of some colored Alabama coal miners
, and the leader of the murderers has
been lynched. The colored men came to
Haman's house for the purpose of robbery.
Haman ran out to get help, but was shot
in the throat. He ran about 150 yards and
fell where he was found dead an hour later.
Jeff Tuggle, a colored miner, was charged
with the murder. He was caught at Weir
City and brought to Cherokee. A few minutes
later Mrs. Haman, the dead man's
wife, accompanied by a score or two of
miners, arrived, and when the woman was
taken before the prisoner she identified
him instantly as one of the robbers. Before
officers could get Tuggle away a mob
captured him. They marched him, with
a rope around his neck, about half a mile
northwest of town hanged him to a
cottonwood tree. and

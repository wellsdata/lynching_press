LYNCH LAW.- We regret to hear that a
wretch named Randall, in Rockingham county
so exasperated the citizens by his long continued
outrages, that he was arrested and
hung by a vigilance committee. If the administration
of law in this county is so feeble
as to make such unlawful procedure necessary
to attain justice, there is something
wrong among the people. To obtain justice,
by violating law is usually to get it at a very
,
heavy.

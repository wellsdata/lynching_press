ENTIRE MOB CAUGHT
BY OKLAHOMA SHERIFF
SENTENCED TO PRISON
( Associated Negro Press)
Oklahoma City, Okla., Feb. 3.-
Lynching received a set back here at
home last week. Five men, two of
them Negroes, were sentenced to life
imprisonment when
they pleaded
guilty today to charges of complicity
in lynching Jake Brooks, Negro. The
trial was one of the speediest in the
history of the state.
Governor Rob-
ertson, who has won a reputation for
defending law and order was active in
seeing justice done.
The white men are Lee Whitley,
Elmer Yeartal, striking members of
the Butcher Workmen's Union, and
Charles Polk, a union sympathizer.
The Negroes are Robert Allen, cousin
of Brooks, and Nathan Butler, also
union men.
Allen made a clean breast of the
atrocity at the county jail last Sun-
day to state and county authorities.
He related in detailed every incident
of the crime from the time the five
lynchers left headquarters of the
Butcher Workmen's Union on Exchange
avenue in Packingtown until
they returned to the union hall after
swinging the Negro on a limb six
miles southeast of the city less than
a hundred ads from the Grand
Boulevard.
Occasional acts of violence which
marked the strike of packing employes
beginning Monday, December 5,
reached the climax Saturday night
when Brooks, a Negro employed at
the Wilson plant, was taken from his
home at 1805 East Fourth street by
two motor carloads of strikers, spirited
away to an isolated spot southeast
of the Capitol Hill district and hung
from the limb of a large tree.
Brooks, who had been ill, was sitting
at the supper table with his
wife and little daughter when the
lynching party arrived. Two white
men, their hats pulled down to shade
their faces knocked at the door.
Brook's little daughter answered.
" Does Jake Brooks live here?"
She replied he did.
she was asked.
The two men, revolvers drawn, forced
their way into the house and seized
Brooks." Nathan Butler turned
you in," one of the men said." We
are going to fix you up right."
Brooks was forced into one of the
motor
cars. The party sped away.
Brooks was never seen until the following
Tuesday when his body was
seen swinging from the tree by B.
A. Reed, 1005 East Fifth street.
Sheriff Ben Dancy started an investigation
of Brook's disappearance
early Sunday after Brook's wife reported
that the police refused to go
outside of the city to search for her
husband.
The discovery of Brook's body
brought about a tense situation which
resulted in an appeal being made for
the institution of martial law. Govtorney
ernor Robertson offered a reward of
$ 2,000 for the apprehension and conviction
of the lynchers. A reward of
$ 500 for each of the party was offered
by the Chamber of Commerce.
Nathan Butler, another Negro, implicated
by Allen's confession, and
Allen was arrested by Dancy's order
the Sunday after Brook's disappearance
. They were released but were
shadowed by deputy sherffs in hope
of obtaining information. The day
brook's body was discovered, Allen
and Butler were arrested by the city
police.
Dancy ordered the men brought to
the county jail, where he questioned
them. Deputy sheriffs immediately
began to make additional arrests. A
total of twenty five arrests were
made. The men were held in separate
cells and questioned.
Thursday Allen confessed to Dancy.
He declared he would have told about
the lynching the day after it occurred
but that he feared that his life would
be taken by the strikers.
" The men out there( referring to
Packingtown) would get me if I told,"
Allen said to Sheriff Dancy."
told me the night they hung Brooks They
that they would hang me too if I
told. They all took an oath not to
say anything about the hanging."
Immediately after Allen confessed
George S. Short, assistant attorney
general, Forrest Hughes, county at-
Govtorney, were called to the county
jail. They continued the questionng
of men held. All but the six implicated
by Allen were released Sunday.
Allen has lost more than forty
pounds since his confession. His
clothes hang about his body in folds.
All night he alternately cries and
prays, Luther Bishop, jailer said, when
Sheriff Dancy is near. Allen follows
him like a shadow, evidently deriving
a sense of security from the nearness
of the sheriff.
" They is going to get me sheriff,"
he cries unexpectedly." They told me
they would hang me if I told. Don't
you let them get me Mr. Dancy."
Colored citizens of Oklahoma City
praised the attitude of the governor
and officials. Roscoe Dundee, editor
of the Black Dispatch, executed a coup
when he secured a picture of the
hanging body and sent copies to President
Harding, the Oklahoma delegation
in congress and 200 copies to
Representative Dyer who is pushing
the anti- law.

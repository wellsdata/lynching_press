Items of Interest Culled From Our Brutal Fiend Lynched Near Florence
JUSTIFIABLE" HOMICIDE."
by Arizona's Citizens.
Phoenix, Ariz., May 7.- Whether
an effort would be made to
prosecute any of the fifty or
more men who participated early
yesterday in the lynching of
Star Daley for killing James Ray
Gibson and attacking Mrs. Gib-
son on the Apache trail Thurs-
day night, remained undetermined
today when Governor Thomas
E. Campbell declined to discuss
the lynching. Both the local
authorities of Pinal county, in
which the lynching took place
and Maricopa, county, from
of
which Dale, whose real name
is Van Ashmore, was being removed
by deputy sheriffs when
captured by the mob, said last
night, that they would not move
in the matter unless sc directed
by Governor Campbell. County
Attorney Richardson of Pinal
county pointed out that a coroner's
jury had found that" Da-
ley was the victim of justifiable
homicide committed by persons
unknown to the jury," and that
the identity of none of the members
of the mob was known to
the officers. The authorities
further expresesd doubt that a
conviction could be had even if
any of the members of the mob
were brought to trial.
Daley, whose right name was
Van Ashemore, was taken from
deputy sheriffs early Sunday
morning, as he was being transferred
from the jail in Phoenix
to the penitentiary at Florence,
taken to the scene of his crime
and there executed after the
vigilantes, fifty in number, had
recited the Lord's prayer.
The prisoner was removed
from the jail here at midnight,
when the officers got word that
a plan was on foot to storm the
jail. The lynching occurred four
the
hours later at the scene of
attacks on the Gibsons, near
Mesa. Daley, who had retained
his composure during the preliminaries
to the lynching and
who showed a member of the
party how to make a noose,
collapsed at the last minute,
when he was asked if he wished
to pray and the mob recited the
Lord's prayer in unison for him.
Before he was hanged, Daley
confessed to the killing of Gib-
son and the attack on Mrs. Gib-
son and enumerated several holdups
and bank robberies in Okla-
homa, Kansas, Missouri and Cal-
ifornia in which he said he had
part and in which he betaken
lieved he had killed three men.

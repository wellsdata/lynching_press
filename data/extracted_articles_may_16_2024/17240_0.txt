that" if we need a federal
law for murder by lynchers, you

Press Club, argued against
the civil rights program and declared

more gang murders in New York
in five years than we have had
lynchings in the South in 50

failure of" policing by the federal

federal agents were acting

amendment, but by legislative
flat to use a federal police power
to take over election mach-
laws, and impose employment
restrictions contrary to the
wishes of both employers
employes." and

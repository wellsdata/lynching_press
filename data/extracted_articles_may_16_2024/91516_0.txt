FOUR ARE KILLED
IN LYNCHING RIOT
Soldiers Sent From Camp Greene
When Mob Tries to String Up
Negro Prisoner.
Winston- Salem, N. C., Nov. 18.-
Order was restored here today after
a night of rioting in which four persons
were killed and a score injured,
when a mob attempted to lynch Rus-
sell High, a negro, held in the city
jail on charges of shooting a farmer,
the county sheriff and attacking the
farmer's wife.
The negro, who was not positively
identified, is believed to have been removed
elsewhere for safe keeping.
Arrival of 175 soldiers from Camp
Greene early today had a pronounced
effect on the mob, which dispersed:
after word had been passed around
that the prisoner had been taken under
heavy guard to another city. The
military took charge of the situation
at once.
The jail at daylight was filled with
persons who were disarmed and locked
up while the mob spirit was at its
highest pitch. The list of dead included
Rachel Levi, a young girl, who
was shot while leaning out of a window
during the indiscriminate shoot-
- ing. Robert Young, a fireman, was
killed while playing a stream of water
on the mob. Charles J. White, a construction
foreman, was fatally wounded
while driving a motor car near the
scene of the rioting. The fourth
tim was an unidentified negro. vic-

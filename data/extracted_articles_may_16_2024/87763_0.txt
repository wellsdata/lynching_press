LYNCH LAW IN CALIFORNIA.- Casesof Lynch
law continue to occur in California. They are
often attended with fearful horrors. A short
time since a man named Dean was lynched by a
bloodthirsty mob, at Watsonville, in Santa Cruz
county. It was hoped that the disgraceful outrage
would be taken in hand by the Grand Jury.
but the matter was dismissed by that body," be.
cause no one could be found who knew any thing
at all of the facts, except that the body of a man
had been discovered hanging to a cross beam.
The Sentinel, published in the vicinity, gives all
the details, and with appropriate comments:
The Justice of the Pence, after hearing the
testimony, ordered that Dean should stand committed
to await his trial for the assault and the
result of the wound, and he was accordingly
committed to the hands of a bailiff, to be conveyed
to the Monterey jail; but the Sheriff's officer,
instead of conveying the prisoner at once to that
place, brought him to Watsonville for protection
. In the mean time the Californians taunted
the American population by saying," if the
case was reversed, they( the Americans) would
hang the Californian, but now one of their own
countrymen committed a crime, and the Am-
ericans would had release him."

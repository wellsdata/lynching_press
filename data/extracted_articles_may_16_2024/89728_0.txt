Too Late
Sullivan, Ind., Nov. 20- James Dil-
lard, the Kentucky negro who criminally
assaulted Mrs. Mary Davis of
Sullivan county, and Mrs. John Lemon
of Knox county on Tuesday last, was
hanged to a telegraph pole near John
Lemon's farm tonight by a mob. Dil-
lard was captured at Lawrenceville,
Illinois, late yesterday afternoon, after
a battle with the marshal during
which the negro was severely wounded
. A mob composed of farmers took
the prisoner from the sheriff and after
taking him before the two vicitims
for identification, hanged him.
The militia was ordered out by the
governor but the instructions were received
too late.-

QUIET MOB LYNCH NEGRO.
Sam Powell Hanged Wednesday Night for
Robbing and Burning House.
Sometime during the night, either
late Wednesday evening or early
Thursday morning. Sam Powell,
the eighteen- year- old negro who
confessed to the authorities Wed-
nesday afternoon that he had
robbed and then fired A. E. Lucas'
house here on Sunday night, June
25, was taken from the calaboose
and hanged to a tree just west of
the reserve pond.
He had been employed by Mr.
Lucas to ride his race horses and
had been working for him about a
month. From location of the fire
when discovered it was evidently
the work of an incendiary and when
Sam Powell left town on Wednes-
day following after changing a$ 20
and a$ 10 bill suspicion pointed
strongly toward him the culprit.
Marshal E. M. Cabaniss as and Mr.
by unknown hands.
The News deplores the lynching
and regrets it occurred in our
midst, as such things are not
ductive of good citizenship. con-

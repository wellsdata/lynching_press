Miles Phifer and Robert Crosky, the
latter a discharged soldier, having
been shot to death by a mob five miles
from the city yesterday afternoon.
Still another negro, Bird Astor, who
was with Temple when Barbare was
shot, was being sought by a posse
and it was believed his capture would
result in mob violence. There was
no connection between the lynching
of Phifer and Crosky and the killing
of Temple. The first named two,
charged with crimes against white
women, were taken from three deputy
sheriffs. The negroes were told
to run for their lives, and as they
started, were shot down. The mob
then quietly dispersed.
Last night Policeman Barbare arrested
Temple, Astor and a negress
on a charge of disorderly conduct, as
a result of a row following a dance.
Temple resisted arrest and shot the
officer, but not until he, himself, had
been wounded. In the meantime As-
tor fled.
A special grand jury will be called
to investigate the two lynchings, Cir-
It cuit Judge, Leon McCord announced

Summer Clothing from this time until the 1st of July;
also a large stock of Gentlemen's Yurnishing Goods, of
all descriptions. These Goo ts are all of the first class,
and will be sold at a small advance for cash. Our
friends from the country, whintend visiting Lynch-
burg during the approaching anniversary of American
Independence, will have an opportunity of furnishing
themselves from out new stock. It is almost unnecessary
for us to state here, that for elegance, style, materials
and workmanship our Goods cannot be surpassed.

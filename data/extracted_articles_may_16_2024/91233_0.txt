. So little faith have the people in the proba-
murderer in New
bilities of convicting a
York, on Wednesday, that a body of indignant
ruffian who in
citizens were near hanging a,
,
Jones's woods where some hundred children
,
were enjoying themselves, first interrupted
them and then gave a police officer a dangerous
and perhaps a fatal blow with a stone.-
The reason for attempting to use lynch law
that it is impossible to bring a culprit to
justice was in New York.

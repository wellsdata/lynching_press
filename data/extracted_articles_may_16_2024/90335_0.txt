AT Hampton, Ark., early on the 14th
two negroes were mobbed by seventy-
five men. Two weeks ago a white man
Iwas killed by three negroes and two
of them were arrested. The culprits
were carried to the neighboring forests
by the mob and hanged to trees.
The men were not masked and made
no effort to conceal their identity.
The negroes greatly outnumber the
whites in the vicinity and further
ble was expected. trou-

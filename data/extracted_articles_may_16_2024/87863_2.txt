not justified except in revenging
and righting, in a measure, the
wrong done an innocent and virtu
woman. But the exercise of
ous
mob yiolence, even in such cases, is
demoralizing, in a measure, in its
results, and brings the public to
hold the law in too light a regard
This leads the people to inflict brutal
mob punishment where it is not
deseryed. The lynching of a negro
in Cleveland county last Monday
night for the murder of T. T. John
son was utterly unjustified and unjustifiable
. First, there was
doubt as to the guilt of the negro
in question; second, evidence is not
lacking that the white men created
the disturbance, and, third, the
white men should have known better
than to be frolicking with negroes
It is a very easy thing for a row to
arise between a drunken white mar
and an ignorant negro. Whenever
whiskey and ignorance come in contact
there is to be trouble
Whiskey and ignorance met at a
negro picnic near Kendall's mill
last Saturday, and the result was
. But the fight should not
as usual
have been followed by the lynching
The murder of Johnson was not such
an one as would justify mob law
.
The courts of Arkansas are competent
and adequate to punish in such
cases, and the leaders and movers of
the mob would have reflected credit
upon themselves and the civilization
and laws of their State had
they relegated the punishment of
murderer or murderers to the
courts the of our land.

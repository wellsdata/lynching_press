THE messages which the governors
of Georgia, Alabama and Virginia have
sent to the legislatures of their respective
states denouncing lynch law are an
encouraging indication of improved
Gov. O'Ferrall, of
public sentiment.
Virginia, urges the legislature to pass
an act requiring every county or city
to fixed sum into the state treas
pay a
ury, for the benefit of the school fund,
for every lynching which may occur
within its iimits. He would have the
cost of furnishing military protection
to a prisoner refunded to the state by
the community in which the man's
safety is threatened. He also recommends
affixing the death penalty to certain
crimes which have most frequently
provoked lynching.-

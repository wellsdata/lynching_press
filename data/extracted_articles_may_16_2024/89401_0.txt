LYNCHING AVERTED
IN MISSISSIPPI
Negro Who Held Girl Prisoner
Taken to Meridian
for Safety
Meridian, Miss .. June 26 .-( Special.)-
This afternoon Sheriff Hunter of Quit-
man, Clarke county, arrived in the city,
having with him a strapping negro man
about 25 years old, who barely escaped
lynching by a mob at Quitman.
It is charged that the negro kidnapped
a white girl by the name of
Daisy Henson, aged 15, who lived near
Quitman, and carried her to a negro
house, where she was detained all
night. A mob, headed by the father,
this
went in search of the girl and
morning found her in the woods a short
distance from the negro house.
The negro man, Tinch Watson, fled
and was captured by the sheriff a short
time after being seen. It then became
a race with the sheriff to save
his prisoner and when he reached the
depot in Quitman he found a train,
got aboard with the negro and brought
him to Meridian and placed him in
jail. The mob was only a short distance
behind the sheriff at Quitman
and threats were made to come on to
Meridian, but the jailer states tonight
that he does not expect any trouble
this kind. of

The picture of a lynching has an unspeakable
horror, but the picture of
the victim of the crime which that
lynching symbolizes is more unspeakable
in its horror. It does not indi-
law. It indicates a
cate a collapse of
collapse of the machinery for the enforcement
of law. Law has its source
in the heart of the community. Lynch
law is justified- if capital punishment
is justified at all- in two cases. First,
when there is no law statutory, and,
second, when the law cannot be enforced
. The fact that we have 7,000
murders and 100 legal executions in a
year indicates that our legal machinery
7 for enforcing law against homicides is
a total failure. It indicates that there
is a call for a radical and sweeping reform
of our laws and the methods of
procedure in such cases. It must
legal
be remembered by those who philoso-
from the Northern point of view

that the crime of rape in the South, as
well as burglary, is classed among the
offences The number of
capital. great
negroes who are lynched are lynched
for this first awful offence which, in
,
my opinion, forfeits the life of the
criminal ten times over as compared
is with homicide. Such is the sentiment
universal of the South.
The question of lynching, let me reis
not question of color but of

crime and the collapse of legal pro-

Hello there, here and everywhere.
Those baseball guys, Robinson,
Doby and the other are really making
history in their line and it is
such a nice line in all lines especially
the" financial line." I just
wonder how it feels to get in the
big time brackets, you know where
your pay check runs into five or
six or seven figures. It must be
grand, hmmm, I wonder. Most all
over the country now graduates
have walked away from schools
and colleges with diplomas and
sheepskins, not knowing what the
future holds for them. Many will
have to be educated again, into
the reality of living. In fact, life is
just beginning for them. You never
realize how much you don't know
until you get out among people
whom you think don't know anything
.
Billy Holiday, the charming chir-
per is free again of the charges of
having dope in her room. I always
believed it was a frame- up.
Two men have been arrested in
the Georgia lynching. I am anxiously
waiting the outcome. They
may be freed for the lack of evidence
. I hope you dig me. The
Negro who was lynched was supposed
to have shot a policeman but
after the Negro was killed, it was
found out it was a mistake.
I don't believe in an eye for an
eye. I believe the guilty should always
be punished regardless of who
it may be, regardless of their color,
of their state.
There is more good in the world
than there is bad, there is more
good in all persons than there is
bad. You don't believe me, of
course you don't. However, it does
not matter. You really would be
surprised at people whom you think
are above reproach. The deeds that
they do in the dark.
Many of us forget the good in a
person's life until he has gone to
the beyond, then we say he was
wonderful. On the other hand, regardless
of the individual, we only
see one side of his life, the dark
side. We would have more and
stauncher friends if we kept looking
for the good in them.
Here is our thought for today:
" Man builds for year, but God
builds for eternity. God has a purpose
and a plan in placing man
the earth."
upon Bye now. So long until then.

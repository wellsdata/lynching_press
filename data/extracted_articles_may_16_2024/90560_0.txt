GUTHRIE, O. T., June 16.- There is
great excitement in this city tonight,
occasioned by two criminal assaults by
negroes today upon white women.
A negro lad named Holley assaulted
Mrs. Charles Moore, the wife of a
freighter who was away from home at
the time.
He was arrested and a mob surround-
ed the jail, threatening to lynch him.
The negroes of the town claimed that
Holley was innocent although he had
confessed his guilt to the sheriff, and a
race war seemed imminent for a time.
There was much angry talk," Judge"
Perkins a negro lawyer being spokesman
for the colored men.
During the excitement he said:" Let
the whites harm that man and this
town will be in ashes before morning."
The sheriff smuggled the prisoner
from jail and took him to Wichita, Kan.
for sale keeping.
The Second Crime.
The second outrage was made upon
the wife of James Genken, who is the
engineer of the electric plant, by an unknown
negro, who escaped. A posse
headed by Genkin is on his trail and
will lynch him if they capture him.
There now seems to be considerable
doubt as to the removal of Holley from
jail. The negroes say that the statement
was circulated by the whites so
the negroes would disperse and give
them( the whites) a tree field for a
lynching. A great mob of negroes surrounds
the jail and more are arriving

Summoning Assistance.
The negroes have sent couriers to
Langston City, the negro colony, ten
miles distant, with the report that the
whites are about to lynch an innocent
negro and many negroes are flocking
here, determined to protect the object
of the white man's vengeance.
Many of the negroes are armed and
chesters hundreds and of revolvers whites are. carrying Win
The police have been reinforced by
the appointment of a large number of
city marshals.
Intense excitement prevails and any
insignificant encounter between a white
and a black maa may lead to a race
war.
Shot to Death.
Midnight- Information has just
reached the sheriff that the negro who
outraged Mrs. Genken was overtaken by
the posse at 8 o'clock tonight, six miles
south of town, and shot to death.
This news has greatly intensified the
excitement, and the negroes are threatening
violence.
The officers have been aware of the
lynching for some hours, and began the
disarmament of the negroes before it became
generally known, anticipating
that the news would drive the negroes
into a frenzy.
At 1 o'clock this morning Police Officers
Lester and Kitchen, with one or
two nervy citizens, ordered a lot of ne-
groes who were stationed on the corner
next to the jail to move on. Several
offered resistance, but the officers used
their clubs effectively. Several decent
negroes jumped on dry goods boxes and
made speeches to the excited crowd.
Officers Rhinehardt, Kitchen, Kelly
and Gepeke were hurt. Two or three
shots were fired. A big burley negro
named Perkins, yelled," Hang the
editor of the News." No sooner were
these words uttered when Bill Tilgh-
man, Jack Tearney, Doc Roberts, Dick
Reavers, Walters, T. Taylor and others
said:" Try it if you dare."
Dispersed the Crowd.
Sheriff Hixon and his deputies
rushed in and quelled the disturbance
and the excited people were quickly
dispersed. Men, women and children
at this moment are on the streets( 1
o'clock a. m.), but it seems that the impending
danger will be averted.
The editor of the News walked down
Oklahoma avenue between two officers
at 12 o'clock, seemingly secure.

street is the rendezvous of the company
and the place is crowded with fathers
and husbands, Republicans and Democrats
alike, who take the stand that the
negro reign is at an end in Oklahoma.
Swarming With Armed Men.
The city is actually alive with armed
men, who are ready to fight to the
death, if needs be.
E. P. McCabe, the negro ex- auditor of
Kansas, is held responsible for the
crimes being committed, and violence
is feared. He cannot be found tonight
and is evidently in no way desirous of
showing up. Whistles are blowing and
shouts resound from every part of the
city. The beautiful city of 10,000 people
is a pandemonium and no one
sleeps this night.
Waiting for the Alarm.
The yell of a determined mob is momentarily
expected and no power on
earth seems able to now save the brutal
ravisher's life. The electric lights have
been extinguished and it seems now
that the worst may happen. Captain

The sheriff and police are resolute..

Unestablished Identity.
Milwaukee, 31.- The identity of
the man, Wilhelm Kuhl, is not yet
settled. Parties are here from Pepin
County, Wis., who say he is a
desperado. At Williams they have
a warrant for him, and expect to
take him back with them. It is expected
if he proves to be Williams,
that the, mob will lynch him.

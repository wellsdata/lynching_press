was handcuffed between two officers.
All were hiding on the bank cf a
creek, so weak from hunger and exposure
that they were unable to offer
resistance.
James was found at 5 o'clock this
afternoon. Word was sent along the
line to the scattered mob to board
the Big Four train and meet the party
with the negro. The whole party arrived
here on the Big Four at 7:40

murder of Miss Pelley, an orphan, 22
years old, employed as a salesgirl.
Another Prisoner Lynched.
At 11:15 tonight the mob, after battering
down the steel cell in the county
jail here, took out Henry Salsener
a white man, charged with the murder
of his wife last July and lynched
him.
Salzner Accuses Sister.
Salzener, a photographer by trade,
killed his wife last July with an axe.
The mob hanged him to a telegraph
pole. His body was riddled with bullets
. The lynching of Salzener followed
closely that of James. The mob
gave Salzener a chance to confess after
the rope was around his neck, but
he could only mumble that his sister
had done the killing. The mob became
furious at this and it was hard
work to keep them off Salzner long
enough to give him a chance to pray.
Alexander Taken Away.
Alexander, dressed in policeman's
clothes, was taken through the city by
the police early this morning, bu
watchers soon discovered this. The
mob put after him, but up to 2 o'cloc!

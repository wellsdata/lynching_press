A SHOCKING STO RY.- One of the most
shocking stories we have ever read, and we
have read many in the years of our connection
with newspapers comes from Bellefontaine
,,
Ohio. On Wednesday, a young lady named
Laughlin, of beauty, accomplishments and unspotted
character, was found murdered. On
Thursday a man named Schell was arrested on
suspicion of being the murderer. The follow-
ing day Schell's wife was arrested, and she
narrated a terrible tale to the Coroner. Her
husband had told her that he intended to ravish
Miss Laughlin and kill her afterward.
On
Wednesday husband and wife took a ride with
Miss Laughlin, and the husband had planned
on this time for the accomplishment of his
great crime. When they arrived at the convenient
place he informed his wife that if she
attempted to accompany him and Miss Laugh-
lin into the bushes he would kill her. He returned
in about two hours, saying that Miss
Laughlin fought so hard that he was not able
to ravish her, although after he had stabbed
her she said," Don't kill me, Jim, I won't resist
any more." Notwithstanding this piteous
appeal he killed her. He threatened, also, to
kill his wife if she told of his crime. At half-
past twelve o'clock on Friday night an attack
was made on the jail at Bellefontaine, the doors
were battered down, Schell was dragged from
his cell, and in a few minutes his lifeless body
was dangling from a tree. Is there any one in
the world that will condemn this lynching of
this monster? Lynch law is generally to be
condemned. This one of the cases in which
it expressed a natural is abhorrence of a monster.

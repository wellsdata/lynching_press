Gov. Candler's Resolution.
The Nashville Banner in discussing the
lynching situation in Georgia, says:
" Governor Candler, of Georgia, appears
to be thoroughly determined to put a
check to mob law in his state. He declares
that he will take personal command
of troops when they are called out to protect
prisoners from mob violence and that
he will no longer depend upon sheriffs who
will not do their duty. Governor Candler
deserves to be sustained in his course by
every citizen of Georgia who has any respect
for law and order. If the governor
could infuse some of his resolution into the
sheriffs and other officers who miserably
fail to do their duty in protecting their
prisoners there would be very little more
mob law in Georgia. It is because official
authority shirks its obligations and readily
surrenders to the mob that lynchings have
become so common."
Governor Candler's plan will not prove
operative. When a mob starts out for
blood it moves and acts quickly, and before
Governor Candler could call out his
troops and personally place himself at
their head, all would be over except the
unfavorable reputation to the state that
would follow.
If Governor Candler has decided to proceed
to business, he will no longer offer rewards
or call out troops; but when a case
of lynching occurs, he will put a couple
of detectives on it and keep them there
until he knows the inwardness of it, and
the name of every person engaged in it.
He will then summon a special court, and
grand jury, and proceed to try the entire
lot regardless of expense. Jurymen may
disregard their oaths and bring in verdicts
of acquital, but if Governor Candler's attorney
general is worth his salt he will find
a way to mete out justice. There is
no other way to stop the lynching habit really.

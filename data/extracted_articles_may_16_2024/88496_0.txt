Citizens.
Courtland, Ala., November 2.- Andrew
Sloss, a negro, was taken from jail here
last night by a mob and hanged to a tree
on the outskirts of town. He was arrested
on a charge of attempting criminal assault
upon Mrs. E. W. Busey, near Moulton, the
victim having been choked into insensibility
in her room Tuesday night. She is now
in a precarious condition from fright. Officers
refused to surrender the jail keys,
the mob battered down the
doors whereupon and secured their victim.

Three Tramps Lynched.
WALLA WALLA, Wash., Dec. 24.- News has
just reached here that three tramps have
been lynched near Huntington, Ore., on
the Oregon Short line, by railroad men.
Four tramps boarded a freight car near
Glen's Ferry, Idaho. They were put off by
the brakemen, but afterwards got on the
train and overpowered a brakeman, whom
they threw under the train. Both his legs
were broken and he died soon after from
his injuries. The report says the tramps
were caught near and three of
them were lynched Huntington. The fourth escaped.

NEGRO MURDERER LYNCHED.
His Pal to Suffer the Same Fate If
He Is Caught.
Wichita, Kan., Sept. 16 .-- The bitter feeling
against Ben. S. Morris, one of the
negroes who murdered John Ruckman,
a prominent cattle dealer, culminated in
a lynching at Watonga, Ok., last night.
The enraged citizens stormed the jail,
overpowered the jailor, dragged the terri
fled negro forth, strung him up to the
nearest tree, and left his body hanging
there. The entire anti- horse thief association
is scouring the country for his accomplice
, who, caught, will meet the
same fate as Morris if.

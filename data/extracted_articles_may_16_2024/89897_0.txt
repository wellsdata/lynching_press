TUCSON
Christmas❖❖❖❖
( By Prof. Cicero C. Simmons, Principal
P. L. Dunbar School)
Taking all the circumstances into
consideration, the colored people have
no reason to despair of their 1919
record, locally and nationally.
Here in Tucson the general character
of our people has changed for
the best. There is a general disposition
tion to be more reliable at their work,
more truthful in their words, and
more dependable generally. In a
word, the secret wish now is: To do
something, have something, and to be
somebody.
Two colored men have quit their
city positions and are now engaged
in farming. One of these men has his
ranch stocked up with hogs, poultry
of all kinds, cattle, horses, excellent
vegetables, barley, and a$ 1500 well
equipped with a 12- horsepower engine
, 15- inch pump, 4- inch pipe.
The P. L. Dunbar school is trying
constantly to lay firmly and securely
the educational foundation of its colored
pupils. The Masonic lodge, Eastern
Star and Household of Ruth chapters
are supplying the fraternal needs
of the community.
Colored employes engaged in what
is termed common labor, as well as
those engaged in skilled labor, made
satisfactory records in 1919. The S.
P. shop boys held their own. Colored
business enterprises are doing well in
the city.
In a national way, colored people
have done well, not only in individual
business efforts, but there is a real
disposition to unite their powers into
big business. For example, colored
people of Savannah, Ga., plan to build
a$ 1,000,000 hotel and business build-
ing combined.
Two Virginia colored banks just distributed
$ 180,000 to their depositors
( 8,000 members of the Christmas savings
clubs).
A negro realty company of New
York city recently purchased a seven-
story apartment house in that city
valued at$ 300,000. Last year Negroes
acquired a dozen elevator apartment
houses in the Harlem.
In the South Negroes, although con
fronted with certain sectional draw
backs, are forging ahead in the manner
of tilling the soil, purchasing more
farms, and securing more city property

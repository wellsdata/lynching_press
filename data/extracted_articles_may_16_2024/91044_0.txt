NEGRO LYNCH TO ATTEMPT
MOB IS FOILED IN AN
Doors of Jail Battered In by Masked
Men With Sledge Hammers
Heroic Demeanor of Sheriff Newcomb Saved
Life of Suspected Slayer
J. A. Petty of
A mob of between fifty and sixty
masked men, carrying heavy sledge
and coal cutters,
hammers, axes
stormed the county jail at 2 o'clock
this morning for the purpose of lynch.
ing the negro, Charles Ragland, who
was arrested at Portland at an early
hour last Sunday morning and locked
up on the charge of murdering Joseph
A. Petty of Florence the previous
evening.
The riotous mob came to Canon
in automobiles from Florence and the
surrounding country and proceeded at
once to the jail on Macon avenue, and
after knocking at the door to awaken
Sheriff Newcomb demanded admittance
and the surrender of the pris-
The demand was peremtorily
oner,
refused and the mob rdered to disperse
. This it refused to do and a
prley ensued between the sheriff
and the assailants of the jail, which
nded by an attempt being made to
batter down the doors with axes.
Wife Secreted Keys.
Hearing the noise made by the mob
the building, Mrs.
at the front of
Newcomb ran for the keys to the
prisoners' cells and secreted them,
her husband in the meantime being
engaged in an effort to repel the in-
valers, Finding argument useless and
realizing the determination of the
men to force their way into the building
, Sheriff Newcomb braced himself
for a strugg! with them and in the
scuffle which followed two or three
of his assailants were hurled through
the wire screen in front of the porch
and back upon the crowd of struggling
men that were endeavoring to
make their way up the steps.
Battered Door.
Finding the sheriff unyielding in
his determination to protect his prisoner
at all hazards, the leader of the
mob called for axes to beat down the
door and after several heavy blows
upon it the heavy oaken panel gave
way and the door swung inward, permitting
seven or eight of the leaders
of the gang to gain admittance to the
allway. Still battling the invaders,
Sheriff Newcomb tried with all his
power to block their ingress and in
the dining room a struggle took place
between him and three or four of the
mob. One of the men got his arm
around the sheriff's neck and endeavored
to choke him into submission.
Two others were holding his arms at
the same time, but he managed to
shake them all off and free himself
for a further defense of the prisoners
In his keeping.
Mrs. Newcomb with rare presence
of mind, telephoned to the electric
light plant and requested that a pub-
lle alarm be blown from the steam
whistle there, which was done. Captain
McKissick of the Bre department
about the same time telephoned is
formation of the at
Jall to Warden Tynan of the peniten
tlar and asked that a detajl rde
08)
be sent to assist in dispersing the
mob.
Warden Sends Aid.
Warden Tynan at once communicated
over the phone with Judge
Wilkin and told him of the attempt
being made to lynch Ragland and
asked him what the consequences
would be if armed men be sent to the
arsistance of the sheriff. In reply he
was told that the law should be up-
held and that it would be perfectly
proper for him to lend the sheriff
what aid he could in maintaining order
.
With these instructions the warden
ant five men armed with sawed off
shot guns hastened to the jail, but
the mob having already realized that
its plans had been folled by the unexpected
gathering of people, began
to desert their leader and when the
penitentiary contingent arrived most
of them had gotten into their automobiles
and driven away in the darkness
. The last automobile load was
just leaving when the warden and his
party drove up in fron tof the jailure
After remaining there until all was
quiet the warden and the guards returned
to the prison, but before doing
so left a small arsenal with the
sheriff for defensive purposes in case
another attack on the building was
made later in. the night.
Picketed Entrances.
When the mob first appeared at
the jail both the rear and side entrances
to the building were picketed
by the leader to prevent the negro
from being spirited away by the offi-
clals to a greater place of safety.
Several shots were fired by the rioters
in the alley for the purpose of
intimidation, but nobody was hurt.
There was no firing in the vicinity of
the front entrance and no effort was
made to inflict bodily harm upon
Sheriff Newcomb, the only purpose
of the assault being to overpower him
and compel him to give up the keys
to the negro's cell
The jail is one of the strongest in
the state and it would be extremely
difficult, if not impossible, for a mob
to break into it except by the use of
dynamite or some other powerful explosive
.
There are five men in jail beside
Ragland and all of them were greatly
alarmed when the attack was made
on the building, as they did not know
what would happen if the assault
should be successful, Ragland himself
was especially nervous and for a few
moments thought that his earthly
days were over.
The fire department, acting under
instructions from Captain McKinlek,
got out several lengths of hose with
a view of assisting in the defense of
the jall by playing a stream of water
on the mob, but were ordered by the
assailants not to use it under penalty
of death. Pipeman Lou Rader was in
the net of. attaching the hose to the
water at the corner of Pourg
street and plug Macon avenue, but
ed when informed that he would be
killed if he did not get away from
there and leave the hose alone.
A twenty- pound sledge hammer and
a coal cutter was left on the front
porch of the jail by the mob and are
now in possession of the sheriff. A
twelve- pound hammer of the same
type was found this morning on the
lawn in front of the Elks club building
, where it was forgotten when the
departure from town
hasty was
made by the would- be lynchers.
It is reported that the visitors
broke all records for speed in lear-
ing town an dthat at some of the
street crossings the autos in which
they were riding did a hurdle act that
was as thrilling as it was unusual.
Praise for Sheriff and Family.
Sheriff Newcomb, his wife, their
daughter, Miss Wilma, and Miss Nel-
lie Torpey of Florence are highly
praised for their self- control under
the trying circumstances in which
they were placed by the assault up-
on the jail this morning, and the fail-
of the mob to lynch the negro
prisoner is due in some measure to
their skillful handling of the situation
, Miss Torpey has been a guest
in the sheriff's family for a couple
of weeks. The heroism of all of them
is worthy of the utmost commendation
.
This morning's assault on the jail
is the second that has taken place in
the last twenty- six years. The first
was on the night of December 4, 1888,
when a mob broke into the old jail
and took George Witherell from his
cell and hanged him to a telephone
pole at the corner of First and Main
streets, Morgan I. Griffith was sher-
iff of Fremont county at that time.
Witherell
was guilty of murder,
prompted by robbery. Several years
previous to that time a mob took
a prisoner away Sheriff William
B. Jones at the from railroad station and
hanged him for cattle stealing.
Stampe When Alarm is Sounded.
There is so doubt that the general
alarm given from the electric light
plant this aorning and the assem-
blege of citizens in the vicinity of the
Jail soon afterwards had much to do
with the stampeding of the mob that
was intent on the lynching of Rag-
land.
Two men were arrested and locked
up for a short time early this morning
ing for drunkenness, but whether
they were any way implicated in
the attack on the fall is not known.
The grand jury which met Monday
morning will doubletss make a thorough
investigation of the attempt
made to lynch the negro this
ing. morn-

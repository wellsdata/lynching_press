MOB LYNCHES NEGRO
NEAR GUERNSEY
Riddles Body With Bullets After
Taking Him From Train- Slayers
Not Identified.
Hope, July 28.- John West, negro,
aged about 50, was shot to death by
six or eight unidentified men
near
Cuernsey, five miles south of Hope,
about 2 o'clock this afternoon. While
it is the general belief that the negro
was lynched, officers who investigated
say the black probably was shot
after he flourshed a pistol and threat-
ened the men who intended only to
whip him.
West and a white man, Andrew
Worthing, both employed by the Kaw
Paving Company, engaged in a street
paving work here, staged a fight this
morning. Worthing is said to have
taken exceptions to a statement by
the negro that" he wss as good as any
white man." West struck Worthing
with a sledge hammer, but the white
man was not dangerously injured.
Worthing and West were arrested
and taken before the mayor, who fined
them both for disturbing the peace.
Later West was advised to leave town.
He bought a ticket for Texarkana, and
boarded Missouri Pacific train No.

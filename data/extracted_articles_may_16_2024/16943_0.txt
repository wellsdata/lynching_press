Negro Stealing in Texas.
The following extract of a letter which we
received by the last mail, dated La Grange, July
29, gives rather a doleful picture of affairs on
the Colorado:
" I have just returned, after an absence of
five weeks, from your State, in Caddo, De So-

agreeably surprised when I returned with the
negro, which created great excitement, as one
of our citizens stole and sold him, and has since
been hung. We go by the name of Regulators
, and are some two hundred strong in this
; the same excitement prevails in the adjoining
county counties."

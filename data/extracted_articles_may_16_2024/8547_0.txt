HURTS! THIS OUCH!
" And since a large number of
American papers are siding with
Great Britain and France in this af-
fair I will permit myself to say that
the thought of the lynchings which
occur daily in the United States and
the memory of the water cures in
the Philippines should make them
chary of attacking Turkey in connection
with acts of savagery committed
by her under provocation
compared with which the economic
the
competition of an Italian or
sniping of a Filipino or the outrage
of a Negro are as nothing.- A. Rus-
Bey, Turkish Ambassador to
Washington tem.
Mr. Bey, in the course of a half
column statement anent the suggestion
of Great Britain that the Unit-
ed States send warships to Turkish
waters, indulged in the foregoing
statement. He also declared that
Christians had not been killed in his
they were Chris-
country because
tians, but because they had incited
Without
insurrection and rebellion.
discussing that feature of Mr. Bey's
statement, it must be admitted that
he hit the bull's eye when he referred
to the lynchings of Negroes
in the south and the resort to the
water cure in the Philippines. The
so- called water cure is now a closed
incident, but the lynchings are a
reality, ever with us, a disgrace
stern to the nation and evidence of
citi-
our inability to protect
zens of our own country or
an indication of our indifference
to the fate of those not
strong enough to protect themselves.
When a representative of the Turk-
ish government can with truth hurl
such a charge as has Mr. Bey at
the people of the United States isn't
it about time for us to pause long
enough to take an inventory and
ascertain just where we are at? Of
course none in authority in this
country indulge in lynchings, but
the governments of the states where
lynchings are not uncommon could
stop such outrages if they went
about the task in earnestness and
determination. Hundreds of innocent
men have been hanged, burned
at the stake or shot to death by infuriated
mobs who had absolutely
no proof upon which to base guilt.
Some one in the mobs gives out the
word that" he has confessed" and
that is all that is necessary to seal
the fate of the doomed man in some
of this country if his skin
sections happens to be black.
It has not been many years since
a wave of indignation swept over
States because of the
the United
treatment of Jews in Russia, but
none of the gentlemen who were
helping that wave along paused to
denounce the outrages committed
against the colored race right here
at home. If the United States is
going to preach to Turkey and to
Russia it must go upon the pulpit
with clean hands and a white record
. That preacher who mounts
the rostrum with a guilty conscience
and who comes to the confession
with concealments will not be tak-
seriously, at least by those who
en know of his deep hypocrisy.
country, and people of this The
especially the people of that section
where human life incased in a colored
skin is held so lightly, ought
to pnoder the words of Mr. Bey
and resolve to rid their country of
the blight of which he so
speaks. truthfully

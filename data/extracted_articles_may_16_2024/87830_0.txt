CROPPER'S TROUBLES.
But the troubles of Field Umpire
Cropper were many. Cropper can run
like a deer and makes an amusing
spectacle when following a base runner

Once yesterday the players and several
hundred spectators surrounded

Some splendid batting sent Andrews

Then Knickerbocker struck the ball
into the hands of the second baseman
and retired the side. The calore 1 boys
distinguished themselves in the
first
principally by fanning the air,
ing, however, in scoring Jackson succeed-.

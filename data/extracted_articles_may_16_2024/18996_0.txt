When Ruby Bates took the stand
and declared that the Scottsboro boys
had never touched her, the court
room went into an uproar. That
night the Ku Klux Klan and the
young upper class blades about De-
catur talked of lynching Buby Bates.
It was a new thing for the Southern
rulers to see a poor white girl
" side" with Negroes Yet this
. new
spirit is slowly seeping into the consciousness
of white share croppers
and workers throughout the South.
slowly they are beginning to realize
that the same powers that lynch Ne
and frame for
"
them"
groes rape
are likewise grinding out the poor
white cotton tenant.
That's why they hate Ruby Bates.
That is why they said of her that
" such people aren't fit to be members
of the white race" and threatened to
lynch her.,

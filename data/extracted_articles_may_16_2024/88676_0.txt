Law is Triumphant in Elmore.
Elmore is just over the river from
the Black Belt. It contains 14,048
whites and 12,051 blacks, and is th re
fore one of the white counties of the
State.
The blacks are, however, so
nearly one- half of the entire population
that there seems to be a good
deal of friction between the races.
In the case under review a difficulty
over trespassing chickens arose be
tween a white man and a black man,
the two living side by side. The controversy
became so acute that the two
men shot at each other, but each one's
bullet went wide of the mark. The
negro was arrested by the local constabulary
, and while he was being
carried to the county jail he was seized
by a mob and hung.
Judge Denson promptly convened a
special term of the Circuit Court and
a grand jury was sworn in, and indictments
were returned against ten
of the lynchers.
On Wednesday George Howard, one
of the indicted, and who is described
in the Associated
Press
report as
" one of the most prominent men in
Elmore County," was placed on trial,
and after the evidence of the State had
been submitted, he asked permission
to make a confession. He related all
the details of the crime in which he
took part. The mob numbered thir-
teen. Seven are in jail, and the other
six" have left the country."
The jury stayed out two hours, and
then brought in a verdict declaring
the prisoner guilty of murder, naming
as his punishment imprisonment
life. for
This case, let us hope, will at least
deprive Judge Lynch of jurisdiction in
chicken cases. It will also shake the
jurisdiction of the esteemed judge in
all other cases. The Elmore case
will be entered not only in the county's
docket, but also in the history of
the State, and if Ã©very circuit had a
Judge as capable and courageous as
Judge Denson is, it would lead on to
a complete restoration of law in the
State, and equivalent overthrow
of anarchy, brutality an and disorder.

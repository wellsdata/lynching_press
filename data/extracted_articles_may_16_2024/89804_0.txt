The Fear of a Ghost.
Fiora, Ind.- The Walnut Grove district
school, two miles from this place,
has been abandoned, the result of a
lynching which occurred on the school
grounds several years ago. Eleven
years ago Amer Green, an alleged desperado
, was taken from the jail at Del-
phi by a mob and hanged to a walnut
tree in the Walnut Grove school yard.
This fact preyed on the minds of the
pupils to such an extent that a sudden
decrease in the attendance was noticeable
, and the decrease continued until
last winter, when only five children
the
could be prevailed on to attend
school, about others having been
transferred to fifty other districts.

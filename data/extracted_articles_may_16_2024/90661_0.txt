NEGRO LYNCHED FOR
A DOUBLE MURDER
A Pale Faced Accomplice Will Meet
a Similar Fate.
Memphis, Tenn., November 1.- A
special to the Scimetar from Sardis,
Miss., says: Reports brought to this
city from Mississippi are to the effect
that a mob of 4,000 persons last night
burned a negro for the double murder
of E. O. Jackson and a millionaire
named Rose.
The negro confessed just before he
was burned and implicated a white
man who lives near Bridgeport. A
posse was formed at once and the capture
of the man was effected last night.
He is being held in custody near the
scene of the tragedy, and there is a
trong probability of his being lynched

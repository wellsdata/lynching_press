It was only by the clever strategy
of Police Captain Davis that a lynching
was avoided. As the policeboat
returned to shore with the prisoner,
two hundred people had gathered on
the bank crying for vengeance, but
Davis told them the prisoner was
dead, that he had taken poison.
The prostrate form of the prisoner
was taken to the patrol wagon and
promptly started for the morgue, but
went jail instead where the robber
was locked to up.

Suesser says that one night when his
sister was in church at Salinas one of the
Farleys sat behind her and put his hands
on her shoulder. His action was suspicious
, and a person seated next to Far-
ley made him desist. Suesser claims that
Farley then told that person that he had
" a notion to kill the girl right here."
The prisoner says that had he remained
in Salinas last night he would surely have
been lynched. Thomas Farley told Keefe
after their arrival here that a mob had
been organized. Farley had served as a
deputy sheriff and knew the jail thoroughly
, and Suesser declares Farley could
have opened the combination door and let
the avengers in.
Suesser has not yet engaged counsel,
but he says he will put up a hard fight for
his life. Since he was previously brought
here to escape lynching, at the time of the
murder Suesser has grown thin and lost
his braggadocio, spirit.
Suesser was seen at the County Jail today
and affirmed the story that Sheriff
Keefe had received information that a
mob from Gonzales intended to lynch
him last night. He is not only afraid that
some of the Farleys may kill him, but
said that a short time ago one of the
Farleys had made a threat against his
sister while she was in church. He denounces
Thomas Farley as a coward for
attacking him on a train when he was in
the custody of an officer and handcuffed.
Suesser says he asked Sheriff Keefe last
evening on the train to loosen his hands
so he could defend himself, and he intimated
he would have settled with
then and there. Farley

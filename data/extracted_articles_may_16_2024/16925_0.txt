The blue laws prevail, or rather ,, Lynch laws.
If a man be caught stealing, he'receives 150 lashes
on the bare back, and letters are sent to all the other
mines, stating his crime and appearance; and if
he is caught again, at any other mines, he receives
200 more; if again, he is taken to a tree, and
shot. Some have made$ 1,000 a week. Provisions
are exceedingly high at the mines, the cost
of transportation is so much. I am informed by
every one that the labor is much harder than any
other kind of work; that it is excessively, hot
there, and there are not less than 20,000 people at
work, digging for the yellow ore. just came
from an extensive house here, and they showed
me an invoice of good goods which they had just
offered for the cost of the things in New York,
( just the face of the invoice.) Saleratus is$ 8 per
lb, butter$ 1 per lb .; shovels only$ 1 a- piece,
and crowbars$ 8. At the barbers they charge$ 1
for cutting your hair,$ 1 for shampooing, and 50
cents for shaving.
It is singular, how some things that are sent,
Supposed to be wanted, are cheapest, and as
cheap as in the States .. most Furniture, there is none.

Amsterdam, May 6.- The lynching
at Collinsville, Ill., last month o

by the mob which hanged him of disloyalty

to make strong representation
with Washington reminding the Am-

holds a number of prisoners upon
whom reprisals can be taken, so as to
prevent lynching of Germans in America
from becoming fashionable
sport. a

Since the court of inquiry was
opened Monday Hardin has been
besieged by conflicting factions. A
number of whites are said to have
declared that if any of the lynchers
were placed in jail a mob would
deliver them; while a number of
the Negro residents have threatened
to lynch any of the lynchers jailed.
Witnesses before the court of inquiry
have been reticent in naming
of those in the mob which
lynched the two Negroes and because
of the difficulties to be overcome
in obtaining the conviction of
any one connected with the lynching
, Hardin said he feels that justice
more probably would result if
cases are taken to the federal
the court.

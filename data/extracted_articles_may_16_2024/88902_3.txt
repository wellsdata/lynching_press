DARLINGTON, Wis., March 15.- The
court ruled Saturday morning that the
special plea of insanity should be tried
before the main issue of not guilty
in the Sieboldt lynching
case.
H. C. then
Martin opened the
case for the defense. He spoke of
the great responsibility that rested
upon the jury, and then went on and
told how insanity had been in the
Meighan family for generations. Tay-
lor, he said, had for years been subject
to epileptic fits which had weakened
his mind. Smith had been drinking
for months and was in great fear of
Sieboldt. Andrews, he explained,
was of a very excitable disposition and
had received a blow on the head when
a boy from which he had never recovered
. He then described the brutal
way in which Meighan was murdered,
and the murderous and desperate
acter Sieboldt was. char

Lynchers Foiled.
Charleston, S. C., Nov. 26.- Last week
a woman was murdered and cremated
near Hodges, S. C. Two negroes were
arrested and landed in the county jail at
Abbeville. An attempt was made about
3 o'clock this morning to take one of the
prisoners out of jail anl lynch him, but
the sheriff refused to admit the lynching
party, and local military promptly responded
to call. The lynchers left
without accomplishing his their purpose.

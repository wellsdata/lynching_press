Burning of a Negro for Murder.
The St. Louis News gives an account of
the burning of a negro at the stake a few
days since by the citizens of Pettis county,
Mo., for the murder, under circumstances of
horrible atrocity, of a Mrs. Rains.
A meeting of the citizens also gave warning
to Mr. France, the owner of the Negro,
to leave the county in ten and the State in
thirty days, for the reason of, besides many
other outrages, having corrupted his negroes
by unchaste conversation, and thus tempting
them to the commission of murder and rape.
We think, if the citizens of Missouri find it
necessary to resort to lynch law, they should
adopt some mode of punishment, which would
not prove the ministers of such summary justice
worse than savages. The idea of coolly
and deliberately roasting a human being
over a slow fire, is a species of barbarism
and cruelty, too inhuman for a civilized
try. coun-

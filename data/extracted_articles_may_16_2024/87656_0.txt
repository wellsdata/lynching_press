LYNCH LAW.- We published last week
our Cowlitz correspondent's communication
in reference to a case of lynching, on the
Mound prairie. We know nothing of the
circumstances ourselves, but freely endorse
" Observer" as a gentleman worthy of confidence
. We earnestly hope there will
never again be a case of lynching in Wash-
willington Territory. Lynch law is the law of
the land defied. Whatever the abuse it
proposes to remedy, the cure is worse than
the disorder. It bids fair to subvert all law
and order in some portions of our Republic.
It is violence, and having just shown its
monster head, let it be strangled at once:
let us have- no more of it here!

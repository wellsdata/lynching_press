A BLACK MURDERER LYNCHED.
The Sheriff Tried in Vain to Resist the
Assault of the Mob.
EVANSVILLE, IND., Dec. 19.- At 9 o'clock
last night, at Owensboro, Ky., Doc. Jones,
a negro barber, while drunk, entered the
shop of John Westerfield( white) and shot
him dead. He was arrested and placed in
jail. Westerfield was well thought of, and
bis death created a storm of indignation.
At 2 o'clock this morning a mob of twenty-
five appeared and battered in the doors of
the jail. The sheriff resisted, but after a
while gave in and handed
over
the keys. Jones was found in
a drunken stupor in a cell, but was quickly
hustled out into the court house yard and
hanged to a tree the limb of which has
served the same purpose before. The mob
then dispersed. The body hung until 6:30
o'clock this morning, when it was cut
down. The general verdict in
to- day is one of approbation. Owensboro

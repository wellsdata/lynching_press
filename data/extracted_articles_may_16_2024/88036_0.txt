Leader Defies Prosecution ..
Cor way, Oct. 13.- The excitement
occasioned by the threat of
the sheriff to prosecute members
of the mob which lynched Frank
Brown, the worthless negro, has
about subsided and the man who
tied the rope around the negro's
neck has spoken out and defies
prosecution. The whole matter
is regarded as a tempest in a teapot
affair and the question of
prosecution is regarded more in
way of a joke than anything
else the.

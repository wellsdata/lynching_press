Boston Negroes Denounce the South.
BOSTON, June 8.- The colored citizens of
Boston in mass meeting assembled last
night adopted strong resolutions denouncing
the outrages on the colored race in the
South and in New York. George W.
Bryan, of St. Louis, said:
We are here for the purpose of denouncing this
promiscuous lynching, burning, etc., whether in
the South or New York. If the Republican party
cannot take this giant coercion by the throat and
throttle it to death now, the negro had better
leave that party. Praying time is over and
reaping time is near at hand. The result may be
the annihilation of the negro race, but there are
to be found new Garrisons, Sumners and Lin
colns, and if we cannot find that class up this
way to lead us, then there will be found some
black John Brown in South.
E. G. Walker, of the Boston, said:
The time for fighting has come. You will
never save our people from being murdered in
the South unless you get up off your knees
kill the men that did it.[ Great cheering.] and

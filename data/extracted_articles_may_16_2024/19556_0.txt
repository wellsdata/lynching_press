ing
Russellville, Ky., August 3, Four
negroes- Virgil, Tom and Robert
Jones and Joe
Riley- were taken
from jail here early Saturday and
hanged to a tree on the edge of
town.
No shots were fired by the mob,
which was composed of about fifty
men, and the people of the town
knew nothing of the affair until day
light revealed the four bodies dangling
from a tree just outside of Rus-
sellville, on the Nashville pike. The
following note was found pinned on
one of the bodies:
" Let this be a warning to you niggers
to let the white people alone
or you will go the same way. Hugh
Rogers had better shut up or quit."
The negroes who were lynched
were members of a lodge and at a
meeting recently it is said they ap-
proved of the murder of James Cun-
ningham, a white farmer, by his neg-
ro tenant, Rufus Browder. The murder
occurred in the southern part of
Logan county and it is supposed here
the mob was made up of men from
that part of the country.
The murder which started the
trouble was one of the most brutal
In the history of Logan county.
Browder, who was a tenant on Cun-
ningham's place, had been discharged
and upon leaving swore vengeance
. The next day he returned and

wait for Cunningham When

Browder fired at him, killing him instantly
. The negro then escaped but
was captured and placed in jail at
Russellville.
A mob immediately formed but the
sheriff, hearing that violence would
be attempted, had Browder taken in
to the woods for the night, and when
the mob made its appearance he
succeeded in convincing them that
the negro was not in jail. The band
dispersed and the next morning
Browder was taken to Bowling Green
and later to Louisville.
The meeting of the negro lodge
and the indorsement of Browder's
deed occurred immediately afterwards
.
The tree on which the
negroes
were hanged had been used
for a similar purpose. before

MISSISSIPPI NEGRO LYNCHED.
Strung Up by a Mob at Glendora for
Double Murder on Christ-
mas Day.
.
Minter City, Miss., Dec. 28- Joseph Hop-
kins, the negro who murdered two white
farmers on Christmas day at Glendora, a
. small inland town near this place, was captured
by a posse at daylight this morning,
on the James plantation, near Swan lake.
Hopkins had concealed himself in a gin
house, but was discovered by two negroes,
who gave the alarm. Hopkins fought like
a demon before being taken into custody,
and when arrested it was found that the
negro had been shot in three places during
the melee. He was not fatally injured,
however, and was at once taken to the
Ecene of his terrible crime. Hopkins confessed
his guilt, and did not plead for mercy
, but begged his captors to make quick
work of him. Little time was lost in carrying
out the request. A rope was placed
about the negro's neck and he was hanged
to a limb of a tree. The body was then
riddled with bullets and left hanging. Hop-
kins' record is a bad one, many recent
crimes being attributed very to him.

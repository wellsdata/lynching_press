-Governor Hamilton has offered a reward
of$ 200 for the apprehension of the
mob or any of the persons engaged in the
lynching of Nelson Howard, the murderer
of John Kane, who was killed on the night
July 6 last, after being taken from the
Pulaski of county jail. This makes$ 400 of-
fered in all for the capture of the men guilty
of lynching Howard, or any of them. If this
amount were multiplied by ten there would
be some probability that some one would
run the risk of" working up" the case, or
that some one connected with the affair
would risk his neck by giving it away; but
under the circumstances,$ 400 is no temptation
at all either an officer or any one
else. for

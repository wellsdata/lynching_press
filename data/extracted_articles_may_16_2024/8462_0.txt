LYNCH LAW INFLUENCE.
Oakland Enquirer: The lynching
mania is taking on new forms, and
now even young children of the repub-
lie have adopted the idea that it is their
duty to execute private vengeance In
.
a school district in Kansas a boy of
fourteen was accused of circulating derogatory
reports regarding one of his
girl schoolmates, and, led by the brother
of the slandered girl, the chivalrous
pupils started out to lynch the offender
. He was lariated and dragged
behind a horse. but before the project
of hanging him could be carried out, the
unsympathetic teacher interfered, cut
the lariat and
saved the boy's life.
What an example do we offer to the
effete monarchies of Europe, in which
justice can only be meted out by law,
while in this happy republic even the
young children are brought up in the
knowledge that every American freeman
can do his own hanging, acting as
and jury, untrammeled by the
Judge tedious forms of law!

The Lynching.
The mob consisted of about 100 men,
perfectly sober and well organized.
They came quietly upon the jail, overpowered
the turnkey and guards and
by means of a sledgehammer soon had
custody of the men within. The guards
were tied and gagged and did not know
which way the mob went, but it is evident
the men were taken directly to the
bridge in the eastern limits of the town.
The ropes were made secure to the railing
or crossbeams and the two were
thrown over, one from one side of the
bridge and the other from the opposite.
mars' feet were touching the water, 15
feet below. The bodies were taken
down at an early hour Sunday morning
and are at present in the city morgue
awaiting the action of the coroner's jury
to- day.
Mrs. Cingmars, mother of one of the
men, has been in the city for the last
two weeks attending the trial. She
knew nothing of the occurrence until
6:30 Sunday morning, and when the
awful truth dawned upon her her
was pitiable. grief

Johnston was first hanged to a telegraph
pole and then his body was rid-
was the first
bullets. It
dled with
lynching in Mercer county in years.

Nita White, daughter of a well known
man. After entering the White home,
where the child was alone, the negro
He
choked and chloroformed her. was
captured later and partially identified
by his victim. To protect the negro,
officers secretly took him out of town
and had reached Lashmoot, when overtaken
by the mob. The negro was
taken away from the authorities and
the return journey to Princeton begun
.
Upon arrival at Princeton the mob
listened to speeches by a criminal court
judge and district attorney. It was
decided to postpone the lynching unti!
tomorrow, pending a certain identification
of the negro by the girl. But later
this decision was reconsidered. Fearing
the arrival of state troops John-
ston was killed. The body was filled
with thousands of shots and badly maltreated
. After the lynching, the crowd,
and the

thorities were powerless to preserve
order.
When the mob learned that Johnston.
had been taken out of town by the authorities
, a request was made for a
special train to go in pursuit. Refused
the special, the mob appropriated an
engine and two flat cars. It is said
many of the members of the mob were
railroaders, friends of Mr. White, the
victim's father. A fast run was made to
Rock, from which point the mob
spread out over the country and caught
up with the fleeing officers and negro
.
The arrival of the mob and negro
was greeted by thousands of spectators
at Princeton. Judge J. F. May-
nard and District Attorney Pendleton
pleaded with the mob to wait until the
negro was absolutely identified, Judge
Maynard proposing to convene a special
term of the criminal court to give
a pssedy trial. The mob seemed impressed
but about this time Mr. White
appeared and positively identified
Johnston as the assaulter. The crowd
broke into an uproar. The negro was
taken under an are light on the main
thoroughfare and put to death.
A special train bearing a company of
militia had been started from Charles-
ton but turned back at Deepwater when
it was learned the negro had been
lynched. The militia company at once
proceeded to the Kanawha strike field

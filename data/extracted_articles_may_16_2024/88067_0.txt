Salzner Is Lynched.
Tonight Cairo is one seething mob.
Henry Salzner, a white man and a
photographer trade, who killed his
wife last July by with an axe, was taken
out of the county jail at 11:40 by the
mob and hanged to a telegraph pole,
and his body riddled with bullets.
This lynching followed closely that of
Will James, a negro, earlier in the
evening.
The mob gave Salzner a chance to
confess after the rope was around his
neck, but in his fright he could only
mumble that his sisters did the
ing. kill-
He was compelled to beg for mercy
from the mob and announced in a
loud voice that Salzner should be
lynched, after which he was driven
away and all attention was given to
Salzner, who cried and begged and
mumbled that his sisters had killed
his wife. His manner further turned
the mob against him and it immediately
clamored for his execution.
After Salzner was hanged and while
the body was being riddled with bullets
, the rope broke and the body
fell to the ground, where it now lies,
the mob going away and leaving it.
Search for the negro Alexander still
continues and only his execution
appease the fury of the mob. will

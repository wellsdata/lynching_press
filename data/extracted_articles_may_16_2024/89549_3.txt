The Florida" Nigger" Hunt.
WILDWOOD, Fla., Dec. 28.- It is reported
to- day that Thomas Mike, the murderer of
conductor Parramore, had been captured,
hanged to a tree, and riddled with bullets,
but upon thorough investigation no basis
for the rumor can be found. At any rate,
hundreds of men are still searching the
woods, and say that Mike is still at large.
and that the reports of the lynching
probably circulated to aid him in escaping were.

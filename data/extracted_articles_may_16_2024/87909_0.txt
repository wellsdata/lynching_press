A few days ago two negroes committed
the crime in Springfield which
has cost many a black brute his life.
A mob gathered to lynch the negroes
but the negroes were spirited away by
the officers to avert a lynching. The
mob became infuriated and three
negroes who were entirely unconnect-
ed with the crimes have been lynched,
a business house belonging to a
man
who loaned an automobile to the
sheriff to take the prisoners away has
been wrecked, the torch applied to a
large number of negro buildings, and
half a hundred people have been more
or less seriously injured in the general
race riot which became so serious as
to necessitate calling out the state
malitia to restors peace and order.
People of the North profess great
love for the negro and some brainless
white bipeds even go so far as to demand
the social equality of the races
and give social equality dinners, as,
NORTHERN LYNCHINGS
Some Northern people waste a lot
of sympathy on the negroes of the
South, and roundly denounce the
Southern whites for occassionally
! lynching a black brute who has de
spoiled the sacred honor of innocent
womanhood, but the recent shameful
episode in Springfield, Ill., the home of
Abraham Lincoln, proves how hollow
the professions of Northern solici-
tude are for the negro.

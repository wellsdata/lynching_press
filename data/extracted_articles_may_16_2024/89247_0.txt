" The spirit of anarchy is abroad in
the land, and if permitted to spread unhampered
for ten years to come, as it
has the past ten years, I shudder when
contemplating the consequences. That
same demonlike spirit which possessed
the brain, the heart, the soul of the assassins
of Lincoln, Garfield and Mc-
nley, erm tes the soul of each
participant in every mob or lynching-
jollification that is celebrated, whether
the victim chances to be' a' big burly
negro' in Georgia, Illinois, Indiana,
Mississippi, Ohio or New York, or a
Swede, German, Italian or other race
descendant, and the seat of the tragedy
in some other state. Anarchy is
anarchy, and it is vitally poison to
good government, and if not checked
rooted out, will assert itself when
or and where it is the least expected.

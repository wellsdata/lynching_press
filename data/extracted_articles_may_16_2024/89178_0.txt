at Hands of White Boy
Terrible Death of Girl
Deland, Fla., February 13.- Following
the finding of the horribly mutilated body
of 14- year- old Mary Tedder at the home
of her father at Glenwood yesterday afternoon
, Irvin Hantchett, a 16- year- old
white boy, was arrested this morning.
He was immediately spirited away by
the sheriff to escape the enraged posses
of citizens also in search of the murderer
.
Additional details received here following
the arrest are horrible in detail. A bicycle
, which the girl was riding, was
found 100 yards from where her body was
discovered, indicating that her assailant
had struggled with her for this distance
after knocking her from her wheel. On
the body of the girl 65 knife wounds
were counted. She was literally cut
to pieces.
That the girl's assailant had other motives
than murder is believed from the
condition of her clothing. She had been
beaten about the face before being
stabbed, as bruises indicated.
Following the organization of posses
of citizens in search of a negro supposed
to have committed the crime, the
sheriff secured bloodhounds and followed
a trail to the orange grove of William
Woolsey, where young Hantchett was employed
. After a careful investigation,
the boy was placed under arrest. In his
room were found bloody clothing and the
knife with which it is believed the murder
was committed. He strenuously denied
that he had committed the crime.
The boy came to Glenwood last October.
Previous to this he had been confined
in a school of correction at some point
Connecticut. As soon as it was learned
13000000 in
that Hantchett .had been arrested on a
strong chain of circumstantial evidence,
excitement was intense. He was spirited
away in an automobile.
A positive statement was issued this
afternoon that the girl had not been criminally
assaulted.
Young Hantchett has been carried to
Orlando and placed in jail. Tonight
feeling was so intense at Glenwood that
it was feared a mob would be formed to
go to Orlando and lynch the boy. An investigation
will be conducted by the
coroner tomorrow.
When he returned to Deland tonight
Sheriff Smith said there was little doubte
as to the guilt of the boy. On one han
was a knife wound, freshly inflicted, and
one of the blades of the knife found on
his person was bent to the point, the
result, it is alleged, of having come in
contact with one of the steels of the cor-
asserted
He
set worn by the girl.
that tracks found in the sand near by
fitted the shoes worn by young Hant-
chett.
Sheriff Smith said that all of the wounds
above the
the girl's body were
on
waist.
Mr. and Mrs. Tedder are respected and
influential residents of this section.

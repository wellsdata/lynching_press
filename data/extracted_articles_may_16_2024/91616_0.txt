GREAT BEND( Kas.), June 13.- In
the public fronting the
square, on
principal business street of this city, a
murderer was lynched at 8 o'clock this
evening by a mob of probably 500 per-
sons. It is estimated that at least
1,000 of Great Bend's population of
2,500 persons witnessed the tragedy.
The victim was John Becker, a white
man, aged about 50 years, who

This morning Becker was brought
here from Hutchinson to be put upon
his preliminary examination. Early in
the day farmers from the neighborhood
of his crime began coming into town,
and by 6 o'clock this evening the
streets were thronged. Then, when it
became known that the murderer had
been granted a change of venue to
Lyons, and that Sheriff Abeer would
take his prisoner east on the Santa Fe
train this evening, there were signs of
threatened trouble, as a big crowd be-

Sheriff Abeer, appreciating the danger,
took Becker into a buggy and started

Bend with
his prisoner. At Dart-
mouth the lynching party left the train
and started back to this city, having

swarming around the jail.

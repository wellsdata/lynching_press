moral; and that some of our newspapers
would cease publishing every sort
of stuff about Negro lynching and
worthiess criminals, aud holding such
a one up before the public as general
results of the Negro problem. And
that some me of of our southern statesmen
would cut out their speeches on Negro
teach their ehildren

through the schools and in the high
ways. that all nations are of one blood
and one flesh and are the children of
one father, the God of the universe.
Then the so Negro problem will
sooner or later called solve itself.

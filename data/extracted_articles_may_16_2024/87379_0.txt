MISS JONES' ASSAILANT IN JAIL.
Mob Pursues Another Brute and
Threatens to Lynch Him.
CHATTANOOGA, Tenn., Aug. 15.- Will
Phillips, the man who recently criminally
assaulted Miss Sallie Jones, daughter of a
wealthy German planter residing near this
city and who was arrested in Arkansas, was
taken to jail in Lafayette, Walker county,
Ga., today, where the crime was committed.
A mob had been organized to lynch Phillips
as soon as Miss Jones identified him, but her
father prevailed on them to let him go to
trial.
Posses are in pursuit of the assailant of
Mrs, and Miss Heathcock and every road
and avenue to Chickamauga park is being
guarded by armed mem. If caught the man
will never reach the jail, as more than a
hundred men have sworn he shall die at
once. Mise Heathcock and her mother have
both recovered consciousness and have given
an ample description of their assailant. A
large reward has been offered for the man.
The assaults on Miss Jones and Heath
cocks occurred within a mile of each the other.

CONVENTION NOTES.
The Wheeling Pow- Wow.
The smiling countenances of
Gov. Jackson, Auditor Miller,
Treasurer O'Brien, Secretary of
State Stalnaker, Joe Gallagher,
Jim Mason, Dan Lucas, J. J. Da-
vis, Hereford, Alec Campbell and
Dan Johnson were delightful to
see when Faulkner's defeat was
announced.
What are West Virginia certificates
worth since Faulkner's defeat
and Mason's triumph? Is
there milk in that cocoanut?
Is it so that S. S. S. i. e. Ran
Stalnaker is to succeed himself?
Mason, head and front of the
syndicate to load West Virginia
with Virginia's debt, worked night
and day for Wilson. What does
it mean? Must the certificates
be paid?
Dan Lucas worked faithfully
against Berkeley's son for Governor
.
The dignified Quarrier, of Ka-
nawha, was so rejoiced at Wil-
son's success that he could not
restrain himself.
Ex- Gov. Pierpoint, full of honors
, ripe in years, rich in mental
treasure and abounding in
, experience
, was present at the convention
, and gave excellent advice,
which many persons may live to
regret was not heeded.
THE PARKERSBURG LOVE FEASC.
The Republicans offer the peo-
hash.
ple a dish of The
people,
however, should not reject the
good meat therein.
Flick and Brown and Hutchin-
son cannot be excelled as citizens,
sound lawyers and pure men.
The idea of turning down Governor
Boreman with his brains,
ability and experience, and substituting
Geo. F. Evans in his
place for permanent Chairman,
was the smallest piece of jugglery
that could be conceived. The
people will rebuke such nonsense.
The placing of John Rufus
Smith on the State Central Committee
, in place of John T. Reily,
was a pointer to success,
planting mediocrity by ability sup-.
Whilst J. N. Wisner was not a
candidate in any sense for Congressional
nomination, still the
solid vote of Morgan, Berkeley
and Jefferson for him, is thankfully
received by the INDEPENDENT.
In the three counties of Morgan,
Berkeley and Jefferson, only Geo.
F. Evans and John Reily voted
against him. The people will appreciate
the efforts of the pair.
Whatever may be said of E.
Willis Wilson, he is a manly man
and no coward, and when he gets
after the Republican convention
for placing Geo. F. Evans at its
head for chairman, and gives the
bottom facts as to all his relations
with the lynching of the colored
man Tolliver, and holds them responsible
, by inference at least, of
endorsing him and his acts, he
will strike a hard but truthful
and telling blow.
Harmony is an excellent theme
to preach, but how much sweeter
to practice, and how true it is that
it is mostly used by the cowardly
and unmanly in a deceptive and
mean manner. Watch the fellow
who yells harmony- he usually
knifes you deeply and surely under
that guise.
John T. Reily was made a member
of the Congressional Executive
Committee. It is a pity that
Reynolds should have to enter a
canvass in this district thus handicapped
and weighted down.
Too many cooks spoil the broth.
The soup is badly burned and
broth sour. the

When Did English Lynch?
" When was an Egyptian lynched
by his British neighbors? When was
a Colored man in Hindustan burned
at the stake? What disturbance do
you hear of in Jamaica and why is
it that in the vast territory known
as British America, with all its
mixed Races and Indian tribes, a few
hundred policemen are sufficient to
exists
maintain as perfect order as
throughout any rural region of the
world?"
civilized one point I agree with Dr.

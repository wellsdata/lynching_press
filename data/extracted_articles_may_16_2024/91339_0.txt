Witnesses of the scene in Pine street yesterday
, at the time of the arrest of King,
the murderer, say the crowd, composed of
well dressed and intelligent men, was greatly
inclined to lynch law, and that the ruse
by which King was taken through an unoccupied
building was all that saved him
from summary justice. The presence of so
mang unpunished murderers is the subject
much comment, and talk of lynch law is
revived of.

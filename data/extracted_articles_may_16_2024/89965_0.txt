OLATHE, Kas., Sept. 21- Bert Dud-
ley, an ex- convict who was convicted
of murdering Henry Mueller and his
wife, near here, was taken from the
Johnson county jail early this morning
by an armed mob and lynched.
Dudley was a white man.
The mob came to the jail shortly
after midnight and forceably took the
prisoner. He was strung up to a telephone
pole. Feeling against the man
had been running high since the murder
of the Muellers on August 20.
Civil authorities battled with the
mob before Dudley was finally secured
from his cell. City firemen were called
upon to disperse the crowd, but they
were cowed at pistol point. After battering
down the doors of the jail the
mob secured Dudley, led him to a
point just outside of the town
then strung him up. and

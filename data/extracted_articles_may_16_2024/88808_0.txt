A few Negro journals are carrying on
a guerilla warfare on Miss Ida B. Wells
Frederick Douglass, Judge Tourgee
and many other respectable citizens
because of their opposition to lynch
law. These papers show no desire
whatever to suppress mob violence and
are evidently the enemies of the race
to which the editors belong and the
cause which their papers are supposed
to represent. Their chief cry is that
" lynch law agitation is a failure." They
bear the same relation to the cause of
the Afro- American that the copperheads
did to the cause of the union in
the late rebellion. They have lost all
decency respect either for themselves
or and others.

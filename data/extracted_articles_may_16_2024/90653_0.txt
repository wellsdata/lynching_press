SHERIFF BLOCKS
MOB SEEKING
ITALIAN
Alleged Attack on Farmer in
Barber Shop Is Followed
By Serious Threats
CASTLE ROCK, Colo., Dec. 25.-
A mob yesterday attempted to lynch
Mike Munger, an Italian farmer, at
Parker, near here, but was foiled
through intervention by Sheriff J.
Nickson, it became known today. The
attempt followed an alleged. attack
by Munger upon Joseph Whitehead,
also a farmer, while he was sitting in
a barber chair.
The two were said to have quarreled
in the barber shop regarding a
sum of money which Munger alleged
Whitehead owed him.
As Whitehead entered the chair to
receive a" shave," Munger, it is
charged, drew a knife and lunged
toward Whitehead.
Attired in barber's garb, he made a!
dash past his attacker and ran into
the street. Munger followed and inflicted
three serious knife wounds, it
is alleged. Sheriff's deputies ar-
rsted and brought him to Castle
Rock, where he received a light fine
for disturbance and was released.
Upon his return to Parker, a crowd
had massed and was prepared to
carry out sericus threats, according
to Sheriff Nickson, who was called
and succeeded in quieting the crowd.
He was returned to Castle Rock and
in jail to face charges of at- p
lodged tempted murder.

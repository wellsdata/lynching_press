A TASTE OF THE GALLOWS.
An Alleged Murderer Partly Lynched in
Fresno County.
FRESNO, July 16.- Michael Blume,
charged with the murder of A. P. Has-
kins, near Centerville was held to an-
,
swer by the superior court without bail,
Friday at Sanger. The
same
evening at 11 o'clock, according to
Blume, eight men went to the jail, effected
an entrance, without resistance,
bound his hands with a rope and threw
him into a wagon. They took him three
miles to the spot where Haskins was
knocked from& flume, put a
rope around his neck and hanged
him up till he was insensible.
when he recovered, he was asked for
his confession. He said he was innocent
and they hanged him till he was
again insensible. They then let him
down, saying they would let the court
deal with him. Taking him
back to Sanger, they put him
in the locked
jail, the door
and left. Before going they threatened
to hang him if he said anything about
the affair. Blume was brought to this
city today. His left wrist was severely
cut by the rope and hand paralyzed.
Physicians examined his neck and
found his windpipe dislocated. His
neck is swollen and he is unable to hold
his head up. Blume says he knows the
men, but will not reveal their identity
yet. The story has gained circulation
that the hanging was in earnest, but
that Constable Warren Hall arrived in
time to cut him down before he
dead. was

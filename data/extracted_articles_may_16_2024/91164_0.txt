EAST ST. LOUIS RIOTERS
DEATH AND DE-
WREAK STRUCTION ON NEGROES
An Ineffaceable Blot on Our
Great American Democracy
Hundreds of Negroes Shot, Lynched, Burned and Families Homeless
Through Fires Started by the Mob. White Girls and
Women Join in Butchery. Better Class of White
Citizens Hang Their Heads in Shame and
Call for Immediate Action

GAIN the blood- thirstiness of
white people of East St.
Louis the, Illinois, shows no
sign of being satiated as by the
terrible happenings of murder and
incendiarism from Sunday evening
, July 1st, estimates of the dead
and wounded number as high as
250 and thousands of Negro fam-
ilies are left homeless. It is said
that this action of the mob eclipsed
anything prior to it and reduced
the riots of last May to the mere
semblance of a street brawl.
Appaling Incidents in U. S. Civilization
.
The following gives an account
of some of the many atrocities and
losses from fire that took place between
Sunday to Tuesday evening
of this week.
Fires started at noon in three
Negro sections of the city by the
rioters and fanned by a high wind

Negroes rushed from their houses
panic- stricken into the streets they
were shot down like rabbits. Many
bodies were dragged to a creek
and thrown into the water.

carrying from one hand to the
other," and I'm going to get a few

The mob divided into groups of
from 200 to 1,000, scattered over
all parts of the city got their
supply of .32 and .38 caliber shells
from automobiles that dashed
through the streets stopping at
the various points where they congregated
and added to the scenes
of destruction and slaughter by
emptying the contents of their guns
into the bodies of Negro men, wo-
and children, fleeing for

safety.
As the mobs went from section
to section, setting more blazes to
Negro homes, the unfortunates
ran from their cottages, the rioters
firing at them and many falling
back into the flames.
White women and girls took a
prominent part( as was done at
the Eli Persons lynching in Geor-
gia recently) in this, one of the
most disgraceful chapters of the
history of the beauty of American
Democracy, when they beat Negro
as fled from their
women they
burning homes and also tore off
the clothes from their bodies. Well
dressed girls and women, hair
flying and clothing covered with
the blood of their victims led units
of the mob. Two girls, not more
than 19 years old, dragged an old
Negro woman off a street car and
beat her into insensibility with
their shoes. A white woman,
dressed in a blood- spattered frock,
hit one of a group of Negro children
over the head with an iron
bar as they were about to be
rescued, while a Negro man, who
had been hanged to a telephone
pole and shot, was afterward cut
down and a number of women and
children tore his body literally, to
pieces and roasted it in a fire they
had made. Two Negroes were
lynched at a point in the city and
four were killed by snipers.
Police and Militia Powerless to
Act.
Policemen and guardsmen of the
militia were said to be overpowered
by the mob and were practically
useless. Only here and
there did they accomplish a little
rescue work. Three or four soldiers
, disarmed and cowed by the
mob were forced to join the rioters
. One was forced to kill a
Negro at the approach to the
bridge leading to the Missouri
side. Col. S. O. Tripp succeeded
in rescuing an aged Negro who
was being dragged at the end of a
rope by more than a hundred men.
The Colonel jumped from his auto-
mobile, and forcing his way
through the mob was allowed to
take charge of the man without
further molestation. A lad of 18
from Effingham was injured while
rescuing a dozen Negro women
and children. Very commendable
for these two instances of hearts
that pulsate with the feelings of
humanity. Did other authorities
adopt such fearlessness, the success
of the mob would be frustrated.
Expressions and Opinions.
" It is the most terrible sight I
have ever witnessed. said Adjut-
ant General Dickson. In the opinion
of the Chamber of Commerce,
had the militia acted vigorously,
much bloodshed might have been
averted. They also demanded to
of the Adjutant General
know why the troopers had not dis-
played more energetic activity in
the whole affair. Members of the
Chamber were not slow to charge
the soldiers with inefficiency bordering
on cowardice. The police
force was also charged with negligence
in attempting to quell violence
.
Cause of Riot.
Honest Negro citizens in their
search for improving their condition
obtain employment in large
firms. Dissatisfaction arises with
the Central Trades and Labor
Council who, though they refuse to
admit Negroes in their union, complain
that these Negro workmen
would not unionize and would not
strike and are therefore taking the
places of white men. Managers
of the plants say that not a white
man had been deprived of work
because of the Negroes. The Colorado
Statesman specially requests
its readers to read between the
lines and make their deductions.
We have never and will never
stop to deaounce this internal law-
lessness and barbarous display and
in our editorial in this issue bearing
on this subject we will champion
the cause with the same fearlessness
and express ourselves in
the same bold and naked manner
as before. In the midst of all these
sufferings we have members of the
white race who will place Citizenship
, National Honor and Human
Liberty above Race Hate, as is
proven by the following editorial
of Wednesday, July 4, of the
Rocky Mountain News, that we
have often highly commended for
its stand for right regardless of
the species of human color. This
journal, realizing the essence of
the National Independence Day,
which gives to all its citizens the
right to move to and fro in this
country in the grand and great
privilege given to the exercise of
a free people does not hesitate to
remind a blind. color prejudice
race in this country of the quintessence
of a Democracy and warns
the government of the support
offered to enemy nations by the
act of such undemocratic and
criminal actions of the members of
the white race:
The Stigma of East St. Louis.
What has taken place in the
past week at East St. Louis, Illi-
nois. U. S. A .. indicates that much
of the common world talk about
" no nationalism" or international-
ism and the immediate abolition of
race prejudices, all leading. of
course, to a world confederacy, is
foolish talk and fails to take into
account present day and world old
history and the mob psychology.
Before we go too far along the
will- o'- the- wisp road we ought to
remove the beam from our own
eye, and not say overmuch about
the mote in other nation's eyes.
The reign of terror, the mob
outbreak, the brutalities committed
on women and children as well
as men in the American city cannot
be condoned. It is a blot upon
the nation. There was very little,
for the orgy of
if any, excuse
bloodshed and incendiarism. It
could not be alleged, as had often
been done further south, that the
Negro population was dangerously
in the majority. Neither was it
a matter of a moment's thought
over an assault that made the
blood boil. The attack upon the
Negro quarter of the town was
premeditated and inspired by selfishness
. days and nights
there had For been threats and minor
outbreaks tending to terrorize the
Negroes and compel them to go
away. When these failed, the mob
spirit gained control and things
were done by white people that
cannot be excused.
Unquestionably the blood lust
that is upon the world today was
responsible for the severity of the
outbreak against the colored race
in a city where they cut no great
figure, We are creatures of environment
and we are at present
thought
surrounded by millions who see red
and who have no other
but to kill or be killed. It would
be impossible for this section of
the globe, so intimately wired with
the European abattoir, to escape
the contagion. The blood thirstiness
, exhibited for so long a period
, against the colored population
must be traced back to what
has been taking place in three
years in a large part of the earth.
Even then the excuse is a thin
whitewash.
The outbreak against the colored
race was economic, when it
was not due to rank race hatred,
dislike of a colored skin. Negroes
were brought into the town by corporations
to work. The whites
took umbrage. White labor was
supposed to be in jeopardy. The
Negro must be taught a terrible
lesson!
We hope it may be possible for
the federal authorities to take a
part in the punishment of the
ringleaders. Otherwise nothing of
consequence is likely to be done.
Much will be heard from foreign
quarters regarding this race outbreak
. It came at a most inoppor-
tune moment. Let the nation bow
its head in sorrow for a moment
for the crimes committed by
today the relatively few.

GOV. JELKS AFTER
PIKE LYNCHERS
Making Thorough Investigation
of the Recent Hanging
TO TAKE VIGOROUS ACTION
Negro Was Dead and Burned Before
Information of the Affair Reached

Montgomery, March 27 .-( Special) -- Governor
Jelks is making a thorough investigation
of the recent Pike county lynching
, and when he has all the facts in
hand it is expected that he will take
vigorous action.
This is the second lynching that has
occurred in Alabama since Governor
Jelks assumed the duties of the office of
chief executive, and in the former case
he offered rewards for the arrest and
conviction of the
" unknown
persons,"
with the result that several of the participants
are now serving terms in the
penitentiary. So far the Governor has
not offered rewards for the Pike county
lynchers, but he is in communication
with the sheriff and solicitor, and when
full information is obtained an attempt
will be made to bring the guilty persons
to justice.
A letter from Sheriff Reeves of Pike in
answer to one from the Governor calling
for a report in the case contradicts the
statement that the negro was taken from
the sheriff by the mob. The lynching occurred
in the country several miles from
Troy, which is the county seat, and the
negro was" dead and buried" before information
of the affair reached the sheriff's
office. Sheriff Reeves is known as
one of the bravest officials in the State,
and no one who knows the official be-
lleves that he would surrender a
to a mob without resistance. prisoner

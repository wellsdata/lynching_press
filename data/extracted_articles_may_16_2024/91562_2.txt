It is estimated that 700 persons witnessed
the execution. No women remained
during the cremation, but many
of them went to the scene before the fire
was lighted and the negro was led from
to carriage or inspection. The
carriage women's vote was a unit for burning.
LIMON, Colo., Nov. 17.- The iron rail to
which John Porter was bound will be left
standing as a warning to all inclined to
deeds similar to that for which young
Porter was burned. A mound of earth
has been piled up around the iron rail,
covering the ashes, it will remain as
a monument in sight and of all passing trains.

Migration Has Impoverished County.
It is thought that the present investigations
are due not so much to the
change in spirit of the Southerners
as to the fact that this county has
been practically impoverished by the
migration of our race. Fully 10,000
colored people deserted the county
immediately after the lynchings, and
agriculture is at a standstill. Circular
letters have been sent many of the
colored people of the vicinity asking
them to remain as a patriotic duty.
An ironical feature is that most of
the recipients can neither read nor
write, on account of the fact that the
South's educational program does not
include the Negro The circulars
thus miss their mark..

After four days of general rioting
at Evansville, Ind., a company
of militia and a mob bent on lynch-
ing a negro had a clash that result-
ed in the death of ten people and
the serious wounding of about
twenty others. The mob, composed
of about 1,000 men, had gathered
about the jail and began an assault
on the deputies and a company of
militia on guard. For several minutes
the contest was waged with
stones and clubs by the mob, the
officers using their bayonets and the
butt of their guns, when a shot
was fired, apparently by some member
of the mob. Then followed a
fusilade from the jail of several
hundred shots, which was returned
by an occasional shot from
the mob. When the firing among ceased
Cato Garrett, colored, who stabbed
a white man to death, was taken
from officers by a mob five miles
from Vicksburg, Miss., and lynched.
A special grand jury was empaneled
within three days after the killing
and Garrett was indicted. He had
been placed in jail in an adjoining
county for safe keeeping, and was
being returned to Vicksburg for
trial when the mob met the train
he was aboard at a small station
and forcibly took him from
officers. the

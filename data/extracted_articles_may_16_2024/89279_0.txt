" There is a certain crime of which
one seldom speaks," Governor Baldwin
continued." Its very name has come
to be banished from our newspapers.
Yet the thought of it is a daily terror
to every woman in the south and brings
a sense of uneasiness and constraint
into the life of her nothern sisters. It
is the cause of most of those lynching
cases which disgrace our civilization.
It is to be down only by the severest
methods kept.

Horrible Murder and Lynch Law.
The Cairo Times and Delta of the 13th. gives
the following additional particulars of the murder
of a girl in Kentucky:
The girl was the daughter of Mr. Jett, of
Blandville, Ky. The dastardly villain cut the
little girl with his knife, in a most cruel man-
her, and after accomplishing his hellish purpose
he cut her throat from ear to ear. The devil was
arrested near Mayfield, and taken to Paducah,
where he was lodged in jail. A delegation demanded
and took possession of him. After a
preliminary lynch trial, he was sentenced to be
burnt, and the sentence was to have been exe-
ented yesterday morning at 11 o'clock. We
have not heard from there to day, but suppose
the sentence was executed to- the very letter.

NEGRO IN PERIL.

Result of a Crap Game.
PITTSBURG, Pa., July 9.- Glenwood, a
suburb of this city, was thrown into excitement
tonight by the threatened lynching
of a young negro named Daniel Scott.
Scott, with three companions, went to a
mill workers' camp near Hays station,
where a game of" craps" was started

and ran with the crowd at his heels.
Patrick Murto caught up to him and demanded

and fired at Murto, the ball grazing
his shoulder and knocking him to
the ground without real injury. Scott
fled, but was captured on the Glenwood
bridge, where a crowd of several hundred
men soon gathered. Murto's companions
, thinking he had been murdered,
wanted to lynch the negro. Before the
police arrived Scott had been used for a
football by the crowd and was a sorry-
looking object when landed in the station
house. Scott claims that his
volver was loaded with blank cartridges re-.

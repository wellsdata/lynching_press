The opinion of the court was read
by Chief Justice Melville W. Fuller,
the venerable Jeffersonian Demo-
crat with his long snow white hair,
severely scored former Sheriff Shipp,
for standing around with folded arms
and winking at the mob that lynched
Johnson.
Chief Justice Fuller in reviewing
the proceedings pointed out that the
jail had been left entirely unguarded
and in charge of Deputy Gibson,
when every precaution to guard the
prisoner should have been taken.
The chief justice quoted liberally
from an interview given out by Shipp
some days after the lynching in
Shipp said that he" did not
which attempt to hurt any of the mob," and
in which he charged the Supreme Court
with the responsibility for the lynching
because of its interference in the
case. Commenting on this utterance
the chief justice said:
" He evidently resented the necessary
order of this court as an alien
intrusion, and declared that the court
was responsible for the lynching. According
to him,' the people of Ham-
ilton County were willing to let the
law take its course until it became
known that the case would probably
not be disposed of for four or five
years by the Supreme Court of the
United States. But,' he added, the
people would not to this, and
I do not wonder at submit it.'

THE MCALPINE MURDER.- We learn from the
last Norfolk Argus, that a meeting of the citizens
of Pricess Anne ccunty was called, to assemble
on Tuesday last for the purpose of taking
some action relative the inhuman butchery
of McAlpine. There is a most feverish excitement
throughout the country, and Lynch law is
freely talked of, providing the supposed murder
er is not re- arrested and secured. Ewell, who is
suspected, is said to be very restless, and manifests
considerable alarm. On further examination
of the body of the deceased, previous to interment
, it was found to be lacerated in a manner
too revolting to contemplate. The heart.
lungs, liver, ribs and intestines, were severed.
McA. and E. had quarrelled at the Court House
when E. drew a knife. They were both jury
men- the Circuit Court for P. A. being in session
. McA. was a member of the grand jury.
E. has also a family, consisting of a wife and five
children. He has been posted in various sections
, and a watchful eye is kept upon him to
prevent the possibility of his escape, should he
desire to absent himself. The scene at the
grave of the deceased is said to have been affecting
and painful in the extreme. The screams
and lamentations of a devoted mother and other
relations, thus suddenly bereaved, thrilled the
stoutest hearts present, and drew forth from
eyes unused to weeping. tears

Atlanta, Ga., Aug. 17 .-( Special to The Press) .-
Leo Frank was taken from the state prison farm near
Milledgeville by a mob last night and lynched.
Plans for the lynching had been carefully laid and
were swiftly carried into execution. The prison guards
were overpowered and an entrance gained into the
stockade where Frank was confined. It is believed the
leaders of the mob were in possession of inside information
and that some one connected with the prison management
assisted in laying the plans.
Erank was convicted three years ago of the murder
of Mary Phagan in a pencil factory in Atlanta. He was
sentenced to hang, but fought the verdict of the jury
through all the Georgia courts, and later through the
United States supreme court. His appeals were all taken
on legal technicalities, the chief one being he was not in
court when the jury returned its verdict. The mob spirit
was so prevalent that the presiding judge advised that
Frank be kept in his cell when the jury reported.
Frank's final appeal was made to Gov. Slaton two
months ago for a commutation of his death sentence to a
life term in the penitentiary. The governor, who retired
from office on July 1, granted the commutation a few
days before surrendering his office. His act aroused a
stormed of protest and it became necessary to station
guards around the governor's home to protect him from
mob violence. Frank was spirited away to the state
farm near Milledgeville, and three weeks later a fellow
convict attempted to kill the noted prisoner by cutting
his throat with a butcher knife. Frank recovered from
this assault, only to death at the hands of a mob
last night. meet

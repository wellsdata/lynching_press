Cheapens Human Life.
[ Washington Democrat.]
The effect of the mob's action on society and
law is the chief feature to be regretted. It
will cheapen human life greatly in the community
where it occurred. Two or three lynchings
in a community make the edicts of the
mob stronger than the law, and thus justice
and right are thwarted. The lynching of Tur-
ley was wrong because there was no reason to
believe but he would have received his just
deserts at the hands of the law in due time.
Civilized people cannot afford to encourage
the mob, however incensed they may feel. Any
act that cheapens human life is an act
good government. against

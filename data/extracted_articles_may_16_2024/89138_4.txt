JELKS GIVES OUT
CORRESPONDENCE
Shows Efforts Made to Protec
Mobile Negroes
MOBILE BAR HAD ACTED
Request for Troops Came Too Late to
Notify Sheriff Powers to Take
the Prisoners
Montgomery Through,
Montgomery. October 6 .-( Special.)- The
correspondence between the governor and
the peopis of Mobile during the last twenty
- four hours, covering the movements
made to prevent the lynching of the two
negroes, Will Thompson and Dick Rob-
inson, furnishes a good story of the
situation and tells of the efforts made
and not made along this line.
When the governor left Mobile Thurs-
day night there had been. held a meeting
of the best citizens of the city and he
was told that there would be no interference
with the carrying out of the law.
However, Judge Semmes of the city court
had said that he would not try the negroes
with the military there. This position he
receded from later, but too late to get
soldiers to the city.
Judge Said He Would Recede.
A request was made last night by a
mass meeting of the bar that soldiers be
sent there. At the same time the judge
wired the governor that he would recede
from his assertion that he would
not try the case with the troops on the
ground. The governor at once wired the
Judge of the action of the mass meeting
and said he would send troops if the
elvil authorities desired that he should.
At the same time he wired Sheriff Powers
at Birmingham to bring the prisoners
by Montgomery. The presumption is that
he would have either taken them off here
or sent a detail of soldiers to protect them
from the mob. However, Sheriff Powers
had left for Mobile over the Southern
some time before the message reached
Birmingham.
The governor was notified this afternoon
of the lynching by the sheriff in the
following laconic message:" Mob lynched
negroes this afternoon. All quiet here."
Governor Jelks said he had nothing to
say. The following is the correspondence
in the premises, beginning as is shown
at 6 p. m. last night and ending at 12:20
today.,

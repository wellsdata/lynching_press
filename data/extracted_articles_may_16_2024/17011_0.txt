LYNCH LAW IN THE MOUNTAINS- A case
of Lynch Law, not, however, of a very severe
character, has lately occurred in Woodstock,
New Hampshire. A letter from that place
states the facts as follows: A man by the name
of Tucker, alias" Colonel," who has a wife and
several fine children, took it into his head to
make love to a young girl about two years
since, and has from time to time, taken her on
journeys with him, and on their return would
leave her at the house of her father Finally
.
,
he informed his wife that he should live with
her no longer, and took the girl to live with
him. Fiske& Norcross, of Lowell, have a
large number of men near this place, during
the winter season, cutting and hauling logs.-
These men, hearing of the matter, met from the
different camps, and, after consultation, agreed
to proceed to Colonel Tucker's house and
make a demonstration. As it was well known
that Tucker usually went armed with revolver
and dirk, there was some hesitation as to
who should" bell the cat," or, in other words,
who should take the lead and enter the
in search of Tucker. house

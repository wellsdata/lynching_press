Expected to Take Action in
Marion Lynchings.
Attorney- General James M. Og-
den today continued conferences
with his deputies, Earl B. Stroup
and Merle M. Wall in preparation
for legal action against Grant
county's sheriff, Jacob Campbell,
under fire for failing to prevent the
lynching of two Negroes at Marion,
Aug. 7.
In accordance with the statute requiring
the attorney- general to take
action against a sheriff from whom
a prisoner is wrested and lynched,
Ogden is expected to file an affidavit
signed by a Marion resident in
Grant circuit court. The action, if
successful, would oust Campbell as
sheriff.
Campbell was in Indianapolis to-
dday but refused to discuss the
case.,

was found three weeks later in the
Pasquotank river almost in front of
her home.
James Wilcox, then a young man
of 25, was the last person seen with
her. He had been paying his attention
to her and a quarrel was said
to have taken place because Nellie
had refused him. When the body was
found Wilcox was arrested and placed
in the Pasquotank county jail. Feeling
against him ran high and it was
Nellie's father, William Hardy Crop-
sey, who died yesterday, who prevented
a mob from lynching by refusing
to join the mob.
Cropsey later said that was" where
he made his mistake," and he died
with the firm belief that his 17- year-
old daughter was murdered by Wil-
cox, who took his own life here on
December 4, 1934, by placing a shotgun
under his chin and blowing his
face away. Wilcox was found guilty
first of first degree murder in 1902,
and at a later trial in Perquimansered
county was found guilty of second de
sentenced to 30
murder and
gree
years in prison. He served 16 years
Governor Bickett pardoned him
before in 1918.

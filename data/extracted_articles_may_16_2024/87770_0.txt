We learn, by the reports from San Francisco, that
a desperado named James Stuart was hung by Lynch
law at that place on the 11th of July, in the presence
of 5,000 people. Citizens of other towns in California
were adopting vigorous measures to protect themselves
from the criminal acts of this set of men the
laws being found inadequate to that purpose.,

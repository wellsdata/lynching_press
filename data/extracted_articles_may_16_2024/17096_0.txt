In like manner, our laws generally de-
son.nounce no penalty, or one very inadequate,
for the flagrant crime of Seduction; so an
unwritten law is making or has made itself.
It is virtually settled, by a score of verdicts,
running through the last twenty years, that a
seducer may be killed with impunity by his
victim, or even by her brother or her husband.
He is a wild beast, whom any one whom he
has specially injured, may shoot or stab with
impunity. We do not here approve or condemn
this chapter of Lynch Law- we
state the fact.-N. Y. Tribune. simply

REPORTER TELLS OF
STATESBORO MOB
SAYS THAT SOLDIERS WERE
DRAWN UP IN LINE, BUT MADE
NO MOVE TO STOP THE LYNCHERS
.
Savannah, August 27.- The military
court of inquiry appointed by the governor
to investigate the conduct of the
state troops at the recent burning of two
negro prisoners at Statesboro, held its
third session today.
The feature of the hearing was the
testimony of G. M. Guergony, a reporter
who went to Statesboro and reported the
tragedy. He testified that the mob dragged
the prisoners along the road to the
stake within thirty yards of the military
camp. There were fifty men of the mili-
tla drawn up in line. There was no movement
by any of the soldiers, so far as
he saw, when the crowd passed, to rescue
the prisoners. He did not know what
officer was in command of the men at the
time.
The mob in charge of the prisoners
amounted to about 200. They were in
shirt sleeves and only a few were armed.
The rest of the crowd, about 200 more,
were spectators and stragglers .. Neither
prisoner was carried in a vehicle to the
place of the lynching. He said Private
Falligant told him that some one had
reported the mob's intent to lynch the
men after conviction and that Falligant
said he reported the fact to the camp
officers and was laughed at.
Private R. L. Miller of the militia
stated that he was among the men on
duty at the rear stairway. Half a dozen
men took his gun away. Private Mc-
Guire saw him and came to his assistance

when the mob came in the room. He
saw, he said, the sheriff as he opened the
door of the prisoners' cell. He was there
when the men tried to get up the steps.
Private Russell testified that he was
sent in the room to guard the prisoners.
The mob was two feet behind the sheriff
and the sheriff ordered the men to stand
aside. The sheriff said:
" Stand aside men and let the mob
take the prisoners; we cannot resist the
mob any longer."
Private Falligant said that he was off
duty on account of a sore arm. He was
told by men in a store that the mob
would get the men when convicted. He
reported the matter to Sergeant Eastman
who said:
" We have heard that a dozen times."
Falligant thought that trouble was
brewing. Soldiers' guns, he said. were
being taken across the street during
the morning, and he counted seven or
eight but became disgusted and quit reporting
it.

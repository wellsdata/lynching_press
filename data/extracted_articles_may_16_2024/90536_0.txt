Kills Wife Embraces Dead Body
An Emotional Ohio Murderer
CADIZ, Ohio, Feb. 7.- A tragedy
reeking with the emotions and passions
of the madnouse was enacted at
the Roby mine settlement near here
today, when John Czesk, a coal min-
er, cut his wife's throat from ear to
ear.
Czesk asked his wife to take a walk
with him. She refused to accompany
, whereupon Czesk in a sudden
him rage grabbed his razor from a clock
mantel and drew its keen edge across
his wife's throat. She died shortly afterward
from loss of blood.
A mob soon formed to lynch the
miner, who at once took refuge in an
upstairs room. From a window he held
the howling crowd at bay until officers
arrived on the scene. Before they took
him Czesk embraced the bead body
of wife, kissed her bloody face and
wept his all the way to the jail here.

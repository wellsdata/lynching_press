West Virginia dispatch tells of
w two negroes were lynched and the
aly other dark complexioned individ-
al in sight chased into the jungles
nd riddled with bullets, and then
inds up:" All the negroes are leav
ng this section." This seems to dis
a remarkable lack of appreciation
play on part of the negroes.

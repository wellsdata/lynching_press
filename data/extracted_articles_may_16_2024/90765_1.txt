AN INDIANA AFFAIR
-
In Which Citizens Became a Law
Unto Themselves.
Boonesville, Ind., Dec. 17.- John Rol-
la the third of the negro men impli-
,
cated in the murder of Hollie Simons,
was hanged to a tree in the court house
yard by a mob of about 100 men from
Rockport at 6:30 o'clock this evening.
Not a shot was fired and everything
was conducted as quietly as if the execution
had been under the sanction of
law.
A battering ram was used to effect
an entrance to the jail and no attention
was paid to the protestations of
the wailing, terrified negro, who was
dragged to the tree. A rope was
thrown over the limbs and a hundred
willing hands sending the negro's body
flying into the air. When the members
of the mob were sure their work was
accomplished tney quietly left the
scene. None of the mob wore masks.
To all appearances men of every
in life took part in the lynching sta-.

NEGRO BRUTE QUICKLY LYNCHED.
Had Assaulted Ã  Fourteen- Year- Old
White Girl.
McKenzle, Tenn., Nov. 15.- Last night
near here Charles Allen, a negro, was
lynched, being shot to death by a band of
men for the raping of Miss Bertie Seals, a
respectable white girl, aged 14, and an orphan
. The negro committed the outrage
about dusk yesterday afternoon, as the
girl was returning from the cotton field.
The cries of the girl brought assistance
after the negro had fled. She told her
story. Pursuit was instigated and the men
caught the negro. He was identified, and
under guard was started to McKenzie.
The news had reached McKenzie, and a
crowd left at once for the scene. The
guard, hearing of the crowd, changed
their course, and about a mile from town
parties attacked them and com-
unknown pletely riddled the prisoner with bullets.

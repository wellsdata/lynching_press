THE GOWARDLY MOB
GOING INTO HIDING
Four of the Leaders in the
Lynching Arrested Springfield
A Special Grand Jury Assembles Today for the Indictment
of all who Can be Identified as
in the Butchery. Participants
Springfield. Mo ... April 16.- Four
men are now under arrest here charged
with being leaders in the mob that
broke into the county jail. Saturday
night and lynched three negroes. One
of the alleged mob leaders is in jail
and three have been released on bond.
The grand jury will meet tomorrow
morning especially to indict those men
who were in the mob of lynchers.
At noon it became known that twenty
- five warrants charging murder in
the first degree were in the hands of
the sheriff. After the arrests the
lynchers became alarmed and left the
streets. Before dark the square was
deserted and tonight it is absolutely
quiet. Around the jail are camped
200 soldiers with guards out at every
point so that none can get near the
jail. No mob that might be raised
here could face that soldiery, and no
one expects a mob or any further
trouble as long as the militia stay ..
It is expected that the grand jury
will indict at least fifty and perhaps
one hundred men. All men supposed
to know the names of any of the mob
will be summoned before the grand
jury and in this way the prosecutor
hopes to get the names of nearly all
who took an active part in the assault
on the jail. Not a man in the mob
wore a mask or made any attempt at
concealment. The names of the leaders
and of those who led the negroes
by the ropes through the streets
and
who lynched them afterward are
known here. well

Burlington, N. J., July 7.- The three
richest land owners here have notified
the public that they will stand a
bondsmen for any one who kills the
negroes who attacked Mrs. Charles
Biddle, a white woman, on Tuesday
In addition, a reward of$ 150 ha
been offered.
William Austin, one of the negroc
fiends, has been arrested at Philadel
phia and his confession has arouse ..
even greater passion than was exhibited
yesterday by the otherwise calm
country people about there.
In addition to these riot exciting incidents
, is the deplorable shooting of
one of the volunteer posse by his coworker
.
As the crime alleged and confesser
by the negro arrested at Philadelphia
is identical with that which has se
often aroused white men in the south
combined with the incidents cited
there are at present all the incentive
for triple lynching.
If a lynching is averted, and it
probably will be, as great efforts are
being made to that end, it is safe to
predict that the lynching of negroe:
who outrage white women in the
south will never again be as vituperatively
denounced by Jersey people.
The courts have adjourned until
September, but Judge Gaskill today
said that he would, in all probability
call a grand jury into session the first
of next week and that if indictments
were found, he would at once reassemble
the petit jury, assign counsel
to the men and proceed to trial at
once.
Judge Gaskill, prior to hearing that
two of the men had been arrested
gave out a statement to the effect
that a reward for the arrest of Timbers
would not be paid unless the man
was brought in alive. He said:
" The county authorities never
thorized the statement that the
ward would be paid for his dead body.
We have not been putting a premium

At the Mount Holly jail, when
stable Thompson brought in a suspect
from New Lisbon, there was a large
crowd in the sheriff's office. It was
C. Craig Tallman, Mrs. Biddle's broth
er, who earlier attempted to strike
Jones at Burlington. Tallman in the
confusion managed to get inside the
jail. It was apparently his plan to
follow the suspect to murderer's row
and there shoot Jones. The sheriff
noticed Tallman's absence, and suspecting
where he had gone, followed
and ejected him.
Albert Whitlock, a prominent young
man of Burlington, while leading the
eschase for Aaron Timbers, the negro
who, it is alleged was the leader of
the negroes, and was the man who at
tacked Mrs. Charles Biddle, was shot
last night by Harry Brown, a young
insurance agent, also of Burlington.
and' seriously wounded ..
. The shooting came as the finale of
a day of wild excitement. Business
had practically been suspended.
Posses of men had been searching
the woods near Burlington where it
was suspected that Timbers and his
unknown companion were in hiding
Several times during the day Timbers
was seen.
At 9:15 last night, when the posse
was beating through the woods, Timed
bers was seen hiding behind a tree.
As He spied the posse of armed men
he made a dash for a clear space,
meaning to, plunge deeper into the
woods. Dozens of shots were fired at
him. Harry Brown fired the contents
of a double- barreled shotgun just as
young Whitlock jumped into range
and received the contents of the
gun in his back and left side. He shot fell
to the ground dangerously wounded.
Timbers in the confusion escaped.
Whitlock was brought to Burlington
and sent to Camden, N. J., hospital.
His wound is very serious and he may
3ot recover.
Eugene D. Speace and Lawrence
Ashby were the first to reach Burling
on with the shooting of Whitlock.
Both are militiamen.
" It was dark and rainy," they said,
" when we began the work of hunting
for Timbers. We had heard that he
was hiding in Factory Woods, about
one and one- half miles from Burling

leading to the woods. We stopped
everyone that came along. The acci

were nervous at having the use of
weapons in their hands.
" We all fired at a man we suppose.l
to be Timbers and Harry Brown in
bis hurry did not see that Bert Whit
lock was right ahead of him and he
shot Whitlock."
It was as much as a man's life is
worth to be on any road near Burling
on or within ten miles of it last
night. Every man who could carry a
weapon was searching for the two ne
groes who attacked Mrs. Biddle. One

Burlington and a section of New
Jersey, 50 miles square, were placarded
with big posters offering$ 500 re
Conward for the arrest and conviction of
the two negroes.
Mrs. Biddle's relatives added$ 1,000
to this sum, adding that they did not
ask for a conviction of the missing
men, but simply want them brought
to Burlington dead or alive.

a stumbling gait. He formerly worked
as a farm hand for Charles Biddle.
In the company of her husband.
Mrs. Biddle identified Thomas Jones.
A great crowd surrounded the jail
when Mrs. Biddle arrived. She was
pale, and apparently on the verge of
nervous collapse.
When Jones had been shown to her
she screamed:
" That's one of the men. I'm sure
of it. He stood guard downstairs
while Timbers and the other man at
tacked me.
0! give me a revolver!
Let me kill him!"
Mrs. Biddle did not identify Fox,
who was a friend of Jones, as being
concerned in the crime and he was re
leased.
Fearing that Jones would be lynch

him to jail at Mount Holly. A repair
car was run down from Mount Holly
and the crowd, supposing it was to be
used in repairing paid no atention to
it.
Then four constables rushed from
the jail door with Jones handcuffed
between them, dashed into the car
and were on their way to Holly
before the crowd was aware Mount of it.

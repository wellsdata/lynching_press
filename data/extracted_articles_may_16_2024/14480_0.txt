How a Body of Masked Men Treated a
Terror of the Neighborhood.
SAVANNAH, GA., September 17.-
Three weeks ago, during the absence of
her husband, Mrs. Thomas Willis was assaulted
in her house in Rogers, on the
Central Railroad, by a negro. Mrs. Willis
defended herself gith a gun, which she
used as a club, but was on the point of
being overpowered when a colored girl,
armed with an ax, rushed to her assistance
, dealing the assailant several blows
on the head. The two woman, after a
desperate struggle, put the negro to flight,
As he ran he seized the gun and fired,
but the shot failed to do any harm,
he escaped, carrying the gun
and
with him. On Tuesday afternoon Ed-

was placed about the jail last night to prevent
it if possible. The prisoner confessed
his guilt in the Brinson case, and said that
he had obtained the gun which led to his
arrest from a negro named Berry Wiggs.
Wiggs, who bears a bad reputation, was
working in the cotton fields about Millen
when Wilkerson was arrested, but on hearing
of the charge against Wilkerson, immediately
disappeared, and has not been
seen since. Other links in this chain of evidence
leave no doubt that Wiggs is guilty
of the Willis assault, and posses of citizens
are scouring the country in search of
him. This morning Wilkerson was sent
to Sylvania to be lodged lynch law. This
against
move had been anticipated, however, and
as Wilkerson was proceeding across the
country, guarded by the officers, they
were met by a band of fifty masked and
well- armed men three miles from Millen.
Having obtained possession of the prisoner
, they hanged him to a tree near the
scene of his crime and riddled his body
with bullets. A similar fate is in
for Wiggs when captured. store

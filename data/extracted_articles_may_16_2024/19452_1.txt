Wife Informed on Him.
Corinth, Miss.( Special) .- Writhing
in the flames of fagots piled by hundreds
of citizens, Tom Clark, alias Will
Gibson, a young negro, was burned at
at the stake here. Clark had confessed
to one of the most atrocious assaults
and murders in the history of
Mississippi, and said that he deserved
his awful fate. On August 19 last Mrs
Carrie Whitfield, the wife of a well
known citizen, was found dead in her
home. Investigation showed that she
had been assaulted. Her head was
practically severed from her body.
Both Whitfield and his wife were re.
lated to several of the most prominent
families in the South, and the indignation
of the people knew nc
bounds. Corinth and the surrounding
country was scoured in an effort to apprehend
the murderer, but diligent
search failed to disclose his identity
Two detectives from Chicago were
employed, but their efforts were fruit
less. Several suspects were arrested
but in each case an alibi was proven
A committee of 12 citizens were named
to continue the search for the murderer
, and these ren have been very
active in their work.
On Monday last it became knowr
that Tom Clark, a negro living near
here, had had trouble with his wife and
that the latter threatened to disclose
the secret of a crime. Officers appre.
hended the and she told
woman,
enough to warrant the belief tha
Clark had murdered Mrs. Whitfield.
Clark was arrested and only Satur
day was brought before the committee
of twelve in Corinth. The negro finally
confessed to the murder and also told
of other crimes that he had committed
.
He said that several years ago he
killed two men on an excursion train
in Mississippi. He told of an outrage
perpetrated by himself on a negrc
woman and also of the theft of$ 1.500
from a physician at French Camp
Miss. Clark said that he never had
been suspected of having committed
any of these crimes and had covereÄ‡
up his tracks in a way to deceive
officers of the law. the

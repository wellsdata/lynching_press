The New York Express, with reference to the appalling
state of society in California, remarks:
The progress of Lynch Law in all parts of Califor-
nia will again arrest the attention of our readers; and
that the executions which take place by authority of
" We the People," under the directions of the Vigilance
Committees, are in order, after due deliberation, by
system even, not in pass on, will also arrest attention.
The California Journals run over with" murders,"
" thefts,"" robberies,"" executions," and other such interesting
items; and the omnipresence of Colt's six bar-
el revolvers, on almost all trying occasions, is another
singular item in the extraordinary history of this extra-
ordinary State. We have not room to dwell upon these
events; but read, and wonder.
The execution of one Stewart, in San Francisco, for
an accumulation of crimes, was resisted by" A Law
and Order Party" outside, which, by the way, has the
look to us of sympathizers with the Stewarts, and characters
of his school; and what is more important, by the
Judge of the Court of Sessions, whose charge to the
Grand Jury we give, and also by the Mayor of the
city.
The San Francisco Courier, defending the Vigilance
Committee of that city, says:
" These things, as lovers of Justice, they must do until
our courts and public authorities shall discharge their
duty and secure the public confidence. Before the legislators
and men in public places began to plunder-
before some of our courts, or certain interested lawyers
began to hedge up the way to the punishment of offenders
, there were no MURDERERS THIEVES AND
INCENDIARIES IN CALIFORNIA. We appeal
to the people of California if this statement be not correct
. The rogues in office are in some measure responsible
before God and the people for all the INNOCENT
BLOOD tha has been shed in this State- for all the
property that has heen sacrificed by burglars and incendiaries
These fellows would never have commenced
their criminal career so freely, so boldly, if
they had not found that the course of justice in our judicial
tribunals might be controlled by money, and instead
the courts becoming a terror to all evil doers, became
THEIR of SOLE FRIEND AND PROTECTOR."

People's Column
Kingston, Md.
July 8, 1935
To the Inscriber of" Chirps"
Sir:
Why do most editors and newspaper
men in general nearly always, I would
not be over exaggerating in saying
always, write from a prejudiced viewpoint
?
During our little mimic" war" down
here on the shore in '33 every county
newspaper around dealt with the subject
thru biased thoughts. Why not
give both sides of every disputed ques-
tion? Were the people right or
wrong in breaking a Commandment
and state law by lynching a negro,
and causing a general uprising? Was
former Governor Ritchie right or
wrong in sending armed men down
here to quell the disorder? Do you
believe, or do you not believe he would
have done the same if the Western
Shore had acted as we did? Here are
a few questions to answer them from
all angles one could write many volumes
.
Have you ever heard the old ex-'
pression," A crow can only see in one
direction?" What about newspaper
men? Can they not give their public
both sides of various controversies and
let the individual decide on which side
of the fence he desires to stand?
I have laughed off many a slur from
out of state boys as well as Western
Shore boys concerning our ungodly doing
here on the Eastern Shore before
I was graduated from University of
Maryland. Why did I, just one of the
many from our Shore away at college,
have to bear the burden of ridicule?
Plainly enough, that question can be
answered. Those boys read only the
biased opinion of Western Shore newspapers
. If I had been attending Wash-
ington College, I would have been
reading the biased opinion of Eastern
Shore and would have
newspapers
heard slurs cast upon the unfortunate
men from across the bay.
That which I have just written leads
up to your prejudiced column in last
Friday's paper( July 5, 1935.) You
recall it concerned Mr. Harry C.( Cur-
ley) Byrd. From your writing, I am
under the impression that you know
Mr. Byrd only thru that which you
have read in newspapers or heard
people say. Indeed, name me an unbiased
person! Could you not have
given your readers," The Pro and Con
on Mr. Byrd as a University Presi-,
dent?" If there is a personal grudge,
if so, leave it out of your newspaper.
The public desires the truth. Why
did you not also give points in favor of
him making a desirable president, and
let the people of the State form their
cwn opinions? According ot my concept
a newspaper editor, or whatnot
should straddle the fence. He would
be in no danger of falling, forces from
both sides would keep him in balance.
Have you never mentioned the
names of notable men who came from
the Eastern Shore? It so happens
that this one came from an adjoining
county, Somerset. I point with
to a man who has" climbed the ladder pride"

Barrett did not wait to see his wife but
turned away and walked to the business
part of the town intending to give himself
up to the authorities. The shooting had attracted
a large crowd and Barrett, thinking
a mob was gathering to lynch him, started
down the Big Four Railroad track toward
Anderson. The marshal had been notified
of the murder and he followed Barrett. He
overtook him at Linwood and went with
him to Anderson, where he locked him in
the jail to await trial. Barrett sent to this
city for Attorney A. R. Hovey, who went
to Anderson immediately.
Barrett lived at 33 West St. Joseph street
and had an office at 25 Kentucky avenue.
was employed by the American
Plate McFall Glass Company.

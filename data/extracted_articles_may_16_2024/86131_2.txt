LYNCHING IN LOUISIANA.
A Desperado Riddled and a Bloody
Feud Thought Possible.
Minden, La., Sept. 9.- Link Waggoner,
a noted desperado of North Louisiana
and Eastern Texas, was shot to death in
his cell in the parish jail by a mob last
night at 1 o'clock. Waggoner, for the
past five years, had been a terror
in that country. Innumerable murders
are laid at his door, and
his robberies were most daring.
He was captured about two months ago
at Nacogdoches, Tex, and brought to
Homer in Clayborne county and tried on
a charge of murder. The case was not
proven against him and he. was sent to
the jail here for safe keeping to
await trial on other charges
against him. While at Homer an attempt
was made by a mob to kill him,
but single- handed having in some unaccountable
manner obtained possession of a
pistol- he kept the whole mob at bay until
assistance arrived. Last night the jail
here was broken into by a mob of
seventy- five, who shot him dead in his
cell and then dispersed. Waggoner has
three brothers in Nacogdoches, and it is
believed they will make an attempt to
avenge his death. The desperado had a
good many friends in this section of the
country and they may also join in the
feud, which would be a bloody one
the outset. from

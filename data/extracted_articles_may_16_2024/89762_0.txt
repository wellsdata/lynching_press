WANT TO HANG A DOCTOR.
Mob of Would- Be Lynchers Seeking
the Life of an Ohio Physician.
CHILLICOTHE, O., Feb. 6.- Great excitement
prevails at Laurelville, a village in
Pickaway county, over the alleged murder
yesterday of Bessie Neff, the daughter of
a farmer residing at Adelphi, and the probability
of the alleged murderer being
lynched before morning. Late last night the
coroner rendered a verdict that the girl's
death was the result of some drug administered
by Dr. Samson, a local physician
, for criminal purposes. As soon as
the verdict was announced a mob of about
three hundred men surrounded Samson's
house for the purpose of lynching him, but
the constable, with an armed guard, finally
succeeded in keeping the mob back and
placing Samson in the jall at Laurelville.
People have been coming in large numbers
into Laurelville all day from the surrounding
country. A large crowd is now hanging
about the jail where the prisoner is confined
, and it is feared that another attempt
to lynch him will be made before morning
although the jail is strongly guarded.,

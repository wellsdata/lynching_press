There is a law in this State for the punishment
of the crime with which the man
William Jones is charged in connection
with the abduction of Nellie Berger, and,
as the evidence is ample for his conviction,
the law should be allowed to take its course.
His lynching would a gross violation of
law and disgrace to the be State.

Neighbors Bent on Lynching.
Rumors that Thompson's neighbors
were bent in lynching the negroes
reached the Moberly officers Friday
morning, and following their preliminary
hearing, when they were bound
over to the next term of the Circuit.
Court, the prisoners were taken to the
Randolph County Jail at Huntsville.
Friday night, it is said, a mob went
to Huntsville, but was outwitted by
Sheriff Henry Owens, who had taken
the negroes to the Macon County Jail.
Last night an unusually large number
of farmers were noticed on the
streets here, but as the negroes were
not in the city mob violence was little
feared. That night, however, about
twenty automobiles sped to Macon, the
jail was stormed and the four prisoners
were taken from the Macon County
Sheriff clad only in their night
and brought to Moberly. clothes

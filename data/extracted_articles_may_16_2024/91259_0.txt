LYNCH LAW AT ARKANSAS.
FORT SMITH,( Ark.,) Sept. 15.- A man who called himself
William Owen, late of Louisville, Ky., was arrested
yesterday for horse stealing, and committed to jail. Last
night about 11 o'clock he was forcibly taken from jail,
and an attempt made to hang bim to a tree.
While the noose was being adjusted to his neck, he
suddenly cast off the rope and fled. A volley was fired
at him by the infurated mob, which brought the fugitive
to the ground. He was then carried back to the calaboose
, where he now lies in a dying condition. Another
thief was brought in to- day, and he will doubtless
share horse the fate of his companion in crime.

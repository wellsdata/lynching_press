Fisher, the man who shot Dr. Waring at Tappahannock,
without provocation, is still in the custody of the proper
authorities. The indignation, though strong, has been repressed
, so that it is not probable Lynch Law will be ex-
ercised. We understand that a warrant was just being is
sued for the committal of Fisher, on account of his threats
at the time he fired on the Doctor. After receiving the
shot, Dr. Waring drove town, where he survived some
four hours.- Fred. Herald into, Oct. 24.

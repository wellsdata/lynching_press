At the time when the people were about
to lynch Stuart and Wildred, two months
ago, the Australian convicts who infest the
city had formed a plan to take revenge by
burning San Francisco. They had a ship
ready in port to transport them and their
plunder from the place, after putting their
plan in operation. Fortunately, this diabolical
project to the knowledge of the
police in time came to frustrate it.

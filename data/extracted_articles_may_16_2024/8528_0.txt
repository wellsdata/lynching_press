A NEGRO named Rouse was lynched last
March in Dooly County, Ga., for the murder
of a white woman. The other day his
brother appeared in the vicinity and
showed a razor, with which he threatened
to cut the throat of the murdered woman's
sister, whereupon a number of white men
organized and whipped the negro to death
Two colored children were burned to.

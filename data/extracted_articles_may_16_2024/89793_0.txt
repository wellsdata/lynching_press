Fifty Famous
Frontiersmen

ELMO SCOTT WATSON
Man Who Knew No Fear
" WYATT EARP is one of the
few men I personally knew
in the West in the early days whom
I regarded as absolutely destitute
of physical fear." That was the
tribute to Bat Masterson, who was
an authority on the subject of courage
as it was exemplified on the
frontier.
A native of Illinois, Earp was
taken to California by his family
as a youth, and at the early age of
eighteen became a stage driver
from San Bernardino to Los An-
geles and then to Salt Lake. Later
he worked in a grading camp that
was building the Union Pacific
across Wyoming, and in the early
70s he was a buffalo hunter in In-
dian territory and Kansas which
led him to the wild cow towns
there.
For one brief hour Earp was marshal
of Ellsworth, Kan., and in that
hour he took his first step to fame
by disarming and arresting the notorious
bad man, Ben Thompson, a
feat of cool courage which has few
equals in border history.
Such exploits as these had some
thing to do with his being made
assistant city marshal of Dodge
City, Kan., in 1876, and so great
was his reputation as a dead shot
and an officer who had to be obeyed,
that during his career in Dodge
City he found it necessary to kill
only one man to maintain his authority
. From Dodge City Earp
went to Tombstone, Ariz., when that
gold camp was truly" wild and
woolly."
He became marshal of
Tombstone, with his brothers,
gil and Morgan, as deputies. Vir
His first test was when he faced
a mob of 500 men intent upon lynch-
ing a character known as Johnny-
Behind- the- Deuce and bluffed them
out. Later he disarmed a noted outlaw
named Curly Bill and hustled
him to jail, there to stand between
him and another mob.
But the most famous of all his
feats and the most desperate encounter
he was ever in was the culmination
of the Earp- Clanton feud
which ended in the historie" Fight
at the O. K. Corral." In that the
three Earps and" Doc" Holliday
faced five men of the Clanton- Me-
Lowery faction, and after a battle
of blazing six- shooters which lasted
less than a minute, three of the
Clantons were dead and the other
two had fled. Earp died in Los
Angeles January 13, 1929, at the
age of eighty, one of the last of
the old- timers of the West and one
of few famous gunmen who
ever the" died with their boots off."

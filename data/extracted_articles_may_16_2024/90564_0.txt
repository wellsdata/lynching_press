A GOOD LAW.
In Ohio, counties where lynchings occur
must pay damages to those dependent
on victims for support, the
same as corporations must pay damages
for injuries by which individuals
are deprived of ability to support themselves
or families. It is a law of that
state the validity of which has been
twice sustained by the supreme court.
A recent decision was made in suits for
damages resulting from the atrocious
Urbana lynchings four years ago. The
members of the mob of lynchers could
not be reached or were irresponsible,
and so the county was sued for$ 5,000
by the heirs of one of the victims of
the mob. This is the amount for which
final judgment has affirmed.-

Two incidents in widely separated sections
of the north still further prove that
lynching is not a question of section, nor
race prejudice confined to the south. With-
in the past ten days two negroes have been
lynched in northen states, one in Ohio and
one in California. When it comes to pass
that a southern governor takes field in per-
son and rescues a negro from a mob, while
negroes are lynched in the north, it is high
time that those who seek to make the negro
question a political one, subside. Judge
Lyath Knows no politics, and it seems me
for the people to lay politics aside in this
particular, and let it lay aside until the
lynching question is solved in a
manner. satisfactory

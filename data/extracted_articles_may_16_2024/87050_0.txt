SOUTHERN ANTI- MOB
The stubborn and successful fight
made by Sheriff Dixon in Savannah
Georgia, against a mob bent on
lynching a negro contrasts strikingly
with the course followed in many
instances by other peace officers.
At Columbia, Missouri, recently the
Sheriff meekly stood aside and let
a mob break into the jail, explaining
afterward that he could not have
stopped the lynchers and would only
have caused needless injury to some
of them.
The Savannah officer, though he
had an enraged crowd to deal with,
stood his ground. He first had a
fire hose turned on the mob, but
this only brought a rain of bricks.
He then held the mob at bay until
State troops came and mounted
machine guns around the jail. The
mob did not care to charge under
these circumstances.
In the annual report of lynchings
made by Tuskegee Institute it was
recorded that during the last year
law officers prevented lynchings in
fifty- eight instances, either by strategy
or by force. In four cases they
used arms. It probably is
not
merely a coincidence that in the
same year the number of lynchings
dropped.
Southern sheriffs
who resist
lynchers do more to hold this evil
in check than any single law could
do. It is of course their duty to do
so, even at great personal risk, and
fortunately there is evidence that
the stubbornness of sheriffs in this
respect is growing. Any community
that desires to do so can stop lynchings
. It can elect sheriffs like Mr.
Dixon and then back them up
keeping the peace. in

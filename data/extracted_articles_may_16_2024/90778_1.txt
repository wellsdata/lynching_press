COMPLIMENTS THE STAR.
Victor, Colo., Sept. 18, 1915.
Denver Star,
Dear Sirs: I wish to say that your
paper of Sept. 18 was a grand paper,
especially the letter and reply on the
lynching of a Negro in Georgia. It
will give" we Southerners" something
to sit up and take notice of.
I only wish it were possible to force
every member of that dear old family
(" we Southerners") to read that article
. Perhaps it might enlighten
some of them.
Yours as ever
W. C., HARRIS.

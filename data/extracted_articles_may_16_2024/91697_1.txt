Associated Press Dispatches to the HERALDI
ST. LOUIS, January 20.- From Boler,
in Mercer county, Missouri, comes the
following story of a deplorable tragedy:
Henry Thomas, an old farmer, has four
grown daughters named Hattie, Mar-
garet, Nancy and Jane, aged 16, 18, 20
and 22 years respectively. Last Wednes-
day night Samuel and Charles Has-
burn, brothers, procured a ladder and
helped Margaret and Jane out of
the second- story window of their
father's house, and, as they were
about to elope with the girls, the old man
appeared on the scene, but too late to
prevent their escape. He at once procured
a horse he had and a shotgun and
started in pursuit. When about twelve
miles from home he overtook the fleeing
party. He immediately opened fire on
them, killing both boys and fatally wounding
Margaret. After getting nearly home
with the girls he was told that the other
two, Hattie and Nancy, had also eloped
with Ned Greason and Thomas Allison.
He at once left the girls he
had with him in the charge of
some neighbors and started after
the others. After securing the other two
girls without any serious trouble he
started back, but when about two miles
from home a mob took possession of him
and strung him up to a tree. The old
man was terribly strict with the girls.
He would hardly let them out of his
sight. Hence the elopement. He always
bragged that he would not be bothered
with lazy sons- in- law. Public feeling is
strongly in favor of the lynching.
garet died last night. Mar-

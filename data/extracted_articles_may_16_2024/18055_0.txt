For some time John Voorhis has been
a teacher in the primary department of
the public school at Williamsburg, Col
He was also an amateur dentist. When
children were unruly he extracted their
teeth as a punishment, threatening them
with greater punishment if they should
tell their parents. He extracted ten
teeth from one Italian boy, who told his
parents. This was the direct cause of
the mob organizing to lynch the
man
.
Voorhis got wind of their coming and
made his escape on horseback.,

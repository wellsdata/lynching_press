COMING TO THEIR SENSES.
The St. Louis Intelligencer, one of the
most influential papers in Missouri, which has
had no word of rebuke for the Kansas ruffians
until now, comes out with indignant portraiture
of the evils inflicted not only upon. Kan-
sas, but upon Missouri, by proceedings which
are a disgrace to our country and the age.
That paper says:-
" Our news from Western Missouri is of
ominous and most discouraging character.-
That region is suffering from mildew and
blight. Its glory is dimmed, its spirit abated
and its hope fading.
The emigration to Kansas has been almost
entirely checked. Emigrants from the free

The result is, Kansas, the fairest land under
the sun, is neglected and idle; occupied by a
very few honest, and earnest, but disenharted
pioneers, and lorded over by a dozen or two
feudal tyrants of Missouri, who curse by their
presence the land they have desolated.
Between these fires, Missouri is leading on
her languid existence. St. Louis is retarded
in a most woful way. Our railroads creep at

Western States build one hundred. In every
department of life we feel the paralysis. Instead
of bounding forward, buoyant, strong

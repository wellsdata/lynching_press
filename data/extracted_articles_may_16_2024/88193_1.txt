Lynching at Argenta.
Argenta, Ark., Oct. 8.- Following the
killing of John Lindsay Saturday and
the wounding of Milton Lindsay, his
son, who is a policeman, by negro un-
dertakers, a mob last night lynched
H. Blackburn, another negro.
The lynching is the culmination of
a long series of clashes between
whites and blacks.
The Lindsays were fired on as they
were passing the Colum Bros', undertaking
shop. The Columns then bar-
themselves and defied the po-
ricaded lice.

melodrama that can
be called to mind. The Fatal Card" ran
in New York for two hundred nights and
made an unmistakable triumph. There is
a lynching episode, an explosion of an infernal
machine, a thrill and a start in every
scene, and a constantly recurring ripple of
laughter from the bright and refreshing
comedy element. In the last act a young
man has tracked the murderers of his
father, and discovers that the father of his
affianced wife is the guilty man. He is
caught by the band of which the murderer
is the head, and, bound to a post, is about
to be killed by an infernal machine, when
the girl's father finds in the lover's pocket
one- half of the ace of clubs. This torn
card was given by the murderer some years
before to the lover, who rescued him from
a mob of lynchers in the Rocky mountains,
In an attempt to remove the infernal machine
and save lover's life, the father
is blown to pieces the.

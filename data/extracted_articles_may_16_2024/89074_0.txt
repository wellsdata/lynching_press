PRISONERS SEEK RELEASE.
Claim They Were Convicted In Court
That Had No Legal Existence.
Huntsville, October 8.- Special.)- Attorneys
for Bud Bell, a former cotton mill
operative, who is serving a term of twenty
years for murdering Frank Stewart of
North Caroina in a saloon, have taken
steps to secure his release on the grounds
that he was convicted in a court that
had no existence. Minerva Walker,
a negro legal woman who killed Constable Rus-
sell at Madison and is serving a life
sentence, will also take some similar
step through her attorney. This is the
beginning of the almost endless tangle
caused by the supreme court's decision in
regard to the Lusk bill. News comes from
Athens that Walter Morris, who was
granted bail by Judge Speake last week,
has been re- arrested and lodged in jail,
the charge against him being murder.
Several of the alleged members of the
Imob that lynched Horace Maples and
who took flight when the grand jury began
investigating the matter, have re-
home, knowing that if they were
indicted turned the indictments will not hold.

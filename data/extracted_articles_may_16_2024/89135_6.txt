AFTER CITING DAY
NEGRO WHO CAUSED TROUBLE
AT STREET FAIR HAS BEEN
RUSHED TO ATLANTA JAIL FOR
SAFE KEEPING.
Macon, Ga., October 7.- Quiet reigns in
this city tonight, and no further trouble
is anticpated. The negro who shot Adams
and Solomon last night was sent to At-
lanta this afternoon for safe keeping.
The miltary is held in readiness in case
of emergency.
The mob succeeded in breaking into the
jail at a late hour last night, but the
negro had been placed in the barracks
under heavy miltary guard.
Two white men charged with murder escaped
during the excitement, but were
captured today. Adams and Solomon are
in the hospital. Physicians cannot determine
how seriously they are wounded.
The negro Fews, who did the shooting,
was wounded but will recover.
Another negro was shot through the leg
at the jail last night while the attack
was beng made on the prison.
Green and Gaynor, two federal prisoners
, convicted of frauds in Savannah harbor
expenditures, were in the jail last
night while the mob hammered at the iron
doors, and after effecting an entrance the
noted prisoners mingled with the enraged
crowd in perfect composure. No further
trouble can occur, as crowds are not
mitted to assemble. per-

On Saturday night, February 20th,
a horrible outrage was committed by
a negro on Mrs. Charles Johnston, and
for fear that a mob would lynch Jun-
kin he was brought to Albia and placed
in the county jail. A mob was organized
in Ottumwa Sunday and came
to Albia on the night train.
It was the protection Sheriff Griffin
gave to Junkin from this mob that
first unsealed his lips. He is an ignorant
negro, steeped in crime, and
he thought that since Griffin had
saved him from being swung up by
an angry mob he could also save him
from being legally hung, by placing
the responsibility of his awful crime
on the shoulders of another negro
by the name of Frank Weaver, who
been boarding at his mother's
had restaurant.

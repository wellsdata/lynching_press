MURDERER BESIEGED IN
DEEP MINE BY POSSE
Aged Miner Kills Merchant and Arms
Himself With Shotgun and Plenty
of Ammunition.
Linton, Ind., November 25.-W. A. Wat-
son, a merchant of Midland, Ind., is dying
at a hospital here, and Louis Shuley,
an aged miner, who shot him early this
morning is besieged in the Tower Hill
mine at Midland.
The shooting was the result of a trivia!
quarrel. The mine is over 200 feet deep,
and it would be necessary for each member
of a posse to carry a light if an attempt
were made to get Shuley, who is known to
be armed with a shotgun and plenty of
ammunition and could make a desperate
resistance from the dark caves and rooms
in the mine. A party will enter the main
way tonight and if the attempts
to come out he will be murderer captured or killed.

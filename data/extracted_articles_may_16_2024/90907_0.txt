The Negroes who lynched another
Negro at Courtland, Tenn., after he
had had a preliminary trial on a
charge of murder and had been remanded
withcut bail made an egregious
blunder. Notwithstanding the
unsound theories on which these acts
of organized lawlessness are sought to
justified, Negroes cannot afford to
be adopt them.

A Negro Lynched.
BIRMINGHAM( Ala.), January 15th.- Bill
Meadows, the negro who outraged Mrs.
Kellum and killed her little son recently,
was arrested and identified by Mrs. Kelluna
to- day. The mob took him into the woods,
hanging him to a tree and riddling his
body with bullets.
Sheriff Smith, who will be remembered
in connection with the killing in the jail
during the Howes execution, is of the
opinion that they lynched the wrong man.
He claims to have the right man in jail.
All serts of rumors are current, one being
that the negroes around the mines may attempt
to avenge the death of Meadows
the perpetration of renewed outrages. by

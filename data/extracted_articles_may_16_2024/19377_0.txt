THE telegraph this morning gives the
particulars of the brutal murder at Austin,
Tex., by unknown persons, of three negro
women and a man, who were all horribly
mutilated. This is only one of many similar
occurrences there, and as a conse-
quence the greatest excitement prevails.
This awful tragedy is supplemented by the
particulars of another no less so in the
lynching of three negro men and a woman
at Pittsboro, N. C., for the murder of the
Finch family on the 4th of July last, and
the murder of the Gunter family near the
same place eighteen months ago. The people
of the Rip Van Winkle State are evidently
waking up to the fact that justice is
slow and the proverbial delays of the law
more confusing and dilatory than they
are usually are elsewhere.

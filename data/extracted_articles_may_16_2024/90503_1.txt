Negro Agitator Shot.
A mob of white men went to the house
of John Durrett, colored, at Coaling,
Ala., to arrest the negro. He had been
trying to arouse the blacks against the
whites for the lynching of Sidney John
on the day before. When Durrett was
ordered to come from his house he cursed
the posse and tried to escape in his night
garments out of a back window. He had
gone fifty yards before he was shot
twenty not times.

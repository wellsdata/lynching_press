SHERIFF SEES
NEGRO LYNCHED
HOUSTON, Miss., Feb. 23.- Divel
Rucker, a negro, 30 years old, was
lynched here today in the presence
of a crowd estimated at 1,000 per
sons, after he had confessed to the
murder of a white woman. The
sheriff and his posse, guarded by
armed members of the mob, looked
on while the negro was chained to
an iron pump in the courthouse yard,
oil- soaked wood piled about him and
set on fire. Four bullets from the
revolver of a member of the mob
hastened the negro's death.
His was the second lynching growing
out of the killing of Mrs. J. C.
Williams, who was clubbed to death
in her home here on Thursday.
Andrew Williams, negro, was first
arrested, charged with the crime. Yesterday
he was taken from jail by a
mob and hanged. Last night Rucker,
an employee of Mrs. Williams' father,
was taken into custody.
Early today the mob took the
negro from the officers, who were
placed under guard.
Rucker was led to a convenient
spot, the court stenographer summoned
and an opportunity given the
to tell his ctory. He was
negro
quizzed for two hours.
He declared that Williams had been
guiltless, and told in detail of entering
the dwelling, ask ng Mrs. Will
lams for money and, on being refused
, choking and beating her to death.
The stenographer made a full record
of the confession and at its conclusion
the question of punishment was
debated.
" Burn him," someone said, and
Rucker was marched to the court
house yard and lynched.
District Attorney Knox in vain
appealed the throng to let the
law take to its course.

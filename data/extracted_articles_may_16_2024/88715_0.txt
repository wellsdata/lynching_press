BILLS AIMED TO
STOP LYNCHING
GENERAL ASSEMBLY EXPECTED
TO TAKE DRASTIC STEPS
ON THIS LINE.
ATLANTA June 29.- That the gen-
eral assembly of Georgia which convened
yesterday in Atlanta will devote
serious consideration to legislation in-
tended to put a stop to lynching is evidenced
by the fact that a number of
prominent members of the house and
senate have prepared bills on the
subject which they will introduce early
in the session.
Among them is a bill to be introduced
by Representative H. J. Full-
bright of Burke county, who would
make the sheriffs directly responsible
for lynchings and who would impose
upon them the penalty of removal
from office for letting lynchings
occur.
The bill provides that where a prisoner
is taken from a sheriff or his
deputy or deputies and lynched by a
mob, the sheriff shall automatically
vacate his office.
Should the fugitive be taken by a
mob and lynched before a warrant has
been served upon him, the governor is
authorized to dismiss the sheriff if it
is shown that the sheriff gave the mob
any hint of the fugitive's whereabouts.
Should a prisoner be taken from one
county to another and lynched by a
mob, the governor is empowered to
remove sheriff in the county where
the lynching the occcurs.

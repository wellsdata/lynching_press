LYNCH LAW.
fr must be a matter of great refear
gret to every sober thinking man i
the community, that in several instances
lately, the people of this part of
the State have been inclined to tak
justice in their own hands, and to ex-
ecute their own judgement on erimi-
nals without waiting on the regular
routine of the law. There is some
excuse for this Lynch Law, in a new
community, where tribunals of Justice
are not established, and where it
is necessary that the friends of law
and order should combine to put down
crime, but in a community like ours,
where all the courts of law are in full
force, and there is every certainty
that justice will be speedily meeted
out to the murderer, the exceu
tion by a mob, is as likely to do evil
as good. Such executions fail in
their object in many ways. The pun-
ishment is not as great to the crim-
inal, as a regular trial and execution
tion by process of law.
The remorse, the terrible waiting
for of Judgment; the trial, exposed
to the curses and contempt of his fellow
men, -the sentence.- the terrible
and deliberate preparations for
the execution, -all these are spared
to the man who is executed by a mob
on his first arrest; who would not
rather be the victim of Lynch Lay
than the waiting and dreading vie-
tim of the regular courts of law?
So we say that Lynch law fails in its
very first principles; it is inten led as
a more terrible and ceartain punishment
than that inflicted by the law,
when it is more swift and then more
merciful.,
Another fact connected with Lynch
law is this, that every one who participates
in the execution becomes
a ariminal before the law. We say
this with all deference to the feelings
of those who have been so outraged
by the bloody butchery of an innocent
man and a good citizen, that
they could not live upon the earth
while his murderer cumbered it, yet
it is true.
It would seem as if if Lynch Law
can ever be justified, it was in the
case in which it was executed at Bar
boursville on Saturday night.
Here was a quiet, good, industri
citizen, making a home for himself
surrounded by a family; a villain en
tres his domestic circle, seduces his
wife, and then conspires with her to
kill him; he tries poison, but that is
too uncertain, and on a peaceful Sabbath
evening, while his victim is setting
by his fireside reading his Bible,
the seducer and murderer comes up
on him with a mur lerous axe, and
sinks it in his brain; he has only
time to cry," don't kill me!" be
fore the crushing blows masked his
skull; but the murderer is not satis-
fied; as his victim falls, he takes a
butcher knife and cuts his throat
from ear to ear, and then he rests.
What next? The body must be
hidden. A bed is prepared for it on
the floor of the stable where it is laid
covered up with manure, and the
and cattle turned in to tramp it down.
The heart sickens to think of all
these details, and is it any wonder
that his many neighbors who had
known and respected him, should be
unable to restrain their virtuous indignation
, and should hurry the murderer
to death, with a little mercy
as he had shown?
It is not, but still it is wrong, and
is not one half so great a punishment
to the murderer as the trial and exe

was the accomplice, and who will
doubtless receive the punishment of
death, is envying her paramour his

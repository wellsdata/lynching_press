WHAT MAY HAPPEN
IN BUCKEYE STATE
Impressions Formed by Professor
Loper on a Late Visit.

Professor J. D. Loper has recently
returned from a visit to his home
in the eastern part of Ohio, where
he spent his vacation. Professor Lo-

Newark, Ohio, at the time of the
lynching of Carl Etherington, the
anti- saloon league detective. The affair
stirred all of that part of Ohio,
for the war between the league and
the liquor element is fiercer there
than anywhere else in the country.
The county in which Professor
Loper was visiting, Monroe, is a part
of the extensive" dry" belt resulting
from the county option elections,
but, though the saloons have been
abolished from the county, the sale
of liquor in" speak easies" goes merrily
on. In many cases the sale is
hardly regarded as a secret. In
some places the resulting conditions
than the old and
are worse ones
many people of strong prohibition
proclivities are wondering if a mistake
has not been made by the wiping
out of the saloons, leaving the
traffic in the hands of the worst
class of men. One old man, who had
been the foremost of the workers for
prohibition and had been regarded
fanatic
by his neighbors as a on
that subject, said that the sentiment,
though a majority sentiment,
was not strong enough to secure an
enforcement of the law, and that, unless
the law could be enforced, the
regulated saloon was preferable to
the" blind pig."
Speaking of the political situation
in Ohio, Professor Loper says the
democrats everywhere are confident
of the re- election of Governor Har-
mon and the republicans have no
confidence that he will not be reelected
. Always a strong man, he
has strengthened himself by the
promptness with which he acted in
the Newark affair. Governor Har-
mon was not elected the first time
by the aid of the temperance vote,
for he was regarded as unfriendly to
cause of prohibition.

Newark lynching has inclined the
anti- saloon league to him and law-
abiding citizens of both parties commend
his action.
The political situation in Ohio has
been further complicated by the rejuvenation
of the Grange, the Patrons
of Husbandry, which came into
being forty years ago and a generation
ago was almost dead. There has
been a reorganization of it lately
and the members declare that they
will vote for their own interest rather
than that of the parties with
which they had affiliated.

LYNCHED, BUT ALIVE.
Negro Hanged by a Mob Cut Down
and Resuscitated.
ALMA, Kan., July 9.- Dick Williams,
a negro, charged with the murder of
two white men, was lynched here this
afternoon by a mob of white men. The
mob left the negro hanging to a telegraph
pole and six minutes later he was
cut down by the town marshal and
taken back to the county jail, where he
recovered consciousness. The
negro is
stl alive, but cannot recover.
On June 28 Harry T. Tandy and an unknown
white man were robbed and murdered
at McFarland, this county. A few
days afterward James Render, alias Den-
ver Kid, and Dick Williams, alias Trilby,
both colored, were arrested by James
Ramsey, chief of police of Topeka, and
when questioned Denver Kid fastened
the crime on Trilby. Today Sheriff True,
of Waubansee county, brought Trilby to
Alma to lodge him in jail. When he
arrived a mob of at least 200 men met
him with his prisoner at the Rock Island
depot, but were foiled until the prisoner
was being placed in jail, when Trilby
was seized, dragged with a rope around
his neck a block and strung up on a
telephone pole, where he hung for six
minutes, when he was cut down by Marshal
Pippert. The crowd, believing him
dead, permitted the officer to take him
back to jail and dispersed.
The people of Alma and country surrounding
are greatly excited, and while
great precautions are being taken to prevent
further trouble, it is feared the
murderer will be again taken from
jail. the

MOTIVE COMES TO LIGHT.
Prosecutor Says Higgins Assaulted
Copple Girl.
That the murder of Mr. and Mrs.
Walter Copple was not the only awful
crime committed by Loris Higgins
the night of May 13 has come to light on
with the lynching of the murderer. It
has been learned that the criminal followed
up his assault on the Copple pa
rents by an even more hideous attempt
on the oldest daughter, Blanche, aged
13 years, and that he accomplished
his purpose three times before fleeing
from the scene of his crimes.
Hiram Chase, county attorney for
Thurston county, who had charge of
the prosecution of the crime, declared
,
that this fact was established by the
voluntary confession of the victim and
was to have been brought out at the
trial. He said the prosecution regarded
the evidence as affording an ex-
planation of the principal motive for
the murder.
In Higgins' confession he admitted
he had stayed about the place for an
hour or two after the murder. At the
inquest following the murder the
small son of the Copples declared that
Higgins was" stuck on" Blanche and
had told him he was going to run away
with her some time.
It was also quite possible that this
fact was known to the mob of lynchers
, though it had been kept very
quiet.
The other motive which the prosecution
was to show, according to Mr.
Chase, was that of robbery. Although
Higgins admitted nothing of the matter
in his confession Mr. Chase and
his co- worker, Ed Smith, an Omaha
attorney, were satisfied that robbery
and
rape were the for Hig-
gins' act. reasons

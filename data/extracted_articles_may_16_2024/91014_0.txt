ATTEMPTED LYNCHING.
Murderer Roner Has a Narrow Escape in
the Central City Jail.
Denver, Aug. 14.- A special dispatch
to the Republican from Central City
says:
Shortly after 2 o'clock
yesterday
morning residents in the vicinity of
the county jail were awakened by a
fusilade of shots, and those who could
see the jail building saw it surrounded
by a small army of men who seemed
to be on guard with winchesters. One
man living in a near- by house stepped
out on the porch and was ordered in
again. He hurriedly complied with
the order.
The cause of the large number of
men surrounding the jail was an attempted
lynching of. Dominick Roner,
who on Monday morning last, at Rus-
sell gulch, stabbed James A. Goddard,
from the effects of which the latter
died at St. Anthony's hospital in
Denver on the afternoon of the same
day..
Just about 2 o'clock Marion Rogers,
who sleeps in a room adjoining the
court room, which is directly over the
jail, was awakened by the breaking
in of a door in an adjoining room.
He immediately opened the inner door
and asked what was the matter,
when he was at once covered by sev-
eral guns in the hands of masked men
and told to preserve silence, and was
ordered back to bed again, where a
guard was kept over him.
All the men wore masks and handkerchiefs
over their faces so
as to
prevent recognition. Immediately
after quieting Rogers, the crowd proceeded
down stairs, and, on reaching
the big wooden door of the jail, at
once brought into play an ax and
crowbar, and, breaking the large Yale
lock, obtained admittance into the inner
part.
The prisoner Dominick Roner, with
three others held as accessories, had
been locked up in the steel cages for
the night and an electric light was
left burning in the
main portion,
which was, however, soon put out by
some of the crowd for fear of any of
them being identified. Before doing
anything else some of the would- be
lynchers shouted," Be careful; don't
touch anyone but Santa Claus; the
others are innocent." Santa
Claus
being a nickname by which Roner, the
alleged murderer was known in Rus-
sell gulch.
The crowd then tried the door of
the steel cage, but seeing that it
ureless to try and force in the door was,
changed their tactics and began shoot
their revolvers into the steel
cage in which the prisoners were confined
. Some thirty shots must have
been fired, and all this time the prisoners
had couched in the side of the
cells near the door, where it was difficult
for them to be hit by any bullet
as the openings in the steel bars are
only two inches wide, and when a revolver
is shoved in it is hard to point
it sideways. After firing the above
number of shots one of the prisoners
shouted out that
in the steel cage
Roner was killed and for the crowd
not to shoot any more. This seemingly
satisfied the attacking party, who then
tried to stick it
lit a candle and
through the bars to ascertain if Roner
was really killed, but as soon as it
bars it was
was put through the
grabbed by one of the prisoners and
extinguished.
The crowd then fired several more
shots, in order, as they supposed, to
make sure of their man, and immediately
began to leave the jail, evidently
feeling satisfied that they had attained
the desired purpose. After the crowd
had gone Rogers notified Sheriff Nich-
els who found that Roner was unhurt.
A posse was at once formed, which
proceeded to Russell gulch to make
arrests. Four men were brought
back but it is doubtful if they can be
held.,

Lynchers to Justice Bring
Atlanta, Ga., Aug. 19. Governor
the
Harris planned to confer with
members of the state prison commission
today relative to steps to be
taken for the arrest and conviction of
members of the mob which lynched
Leo M. Frank. This conference was
to be the first actual step on the part
of the state officials to place the blame
for the hanging.
All three members of the
prison
commission at Milledgeville
were,
where the Georgia prison farm is located
, on Monday night last, when
Frank was abducted. Chairman R. E.
Davison has said he believes none of
the officers at the farm are to blame

the mob was so well organized that
they were powerless.
May Offer$ 500 Reward.

offer a maximum reward of$ 500 for
each arrest and conviction.

will be fully inquired into."

telegrams from outside the state asking
what action would be taken by
the state and urging that a complete
investigation be made.
Acting Mayor's Statement.
I. N. Ragsdale, acting mayor of At-
lanta, has made the following statement
:" The daily and weekly press
of Georgia is practically unanimous in
condemning mob law and urging the
governor to take action in the Frank
case at once. He is investigating now
and will probably offer a reward that
will bring the guilty parties to justice.
While a large percentage of our people
believed Frank guilty, yet they are
law abiding and heartily disapprove
the action of the mob."
As only$ 2,500 is available in the
state treasury for rewards, Governor-
Harris said he would probably offer
the maximum of$ 500 for the arrest
and conviction of five members of the
mob. The legislature each year appropriates
$ 3,000 to be used for rewards

fund has been used this yead.

Warned Deputies to Keep Cool- De
clares a Striker Shot at His Men al
Beaver Meadow- Swears a Man
Struck Him Violently Before the
Shooting Began.
WILKESBARRE Pa
,., March 2.
Chief interest in the proceedings in the
trial of Sheriff Martin and his deputies
centered in the appearance of the sherIff
himself as a witness for the defense.
When he was called and as he entered
the witness stand there was a rustle
of excitement. He was rather nervous,
coughed frequently and could not keep
his hands still. He was asked the
usual questions about his position and
said he was elected in 1895 and took
office the first Monday in January,
1896. He then told his story and spoke
for an hour without interruption.
In beginning he told how he had

been called home from on
account of the strike and stated how
proclamations had been published and
posted to quiet the disturbances. On
the 6th of he said, he had
met the men collected to serve as deputies
. Continuing, he said:
" I told them that it was our duty to
maintain the law and if I found any
,
body violating the law we should ar
I said we did not want
rest them.
to
hurt or shoot anybody and that we
should not shoot unless our lives were
in danger."
The next morning he went to Crystal
Ridge with five deputies and dispersed
three crowds of men who, he stated,
were about to throw stones at men at
work in the strippings. The next day
he went to Drifton and swore in a number
of additional deputies. After re
turning to Hazleton he heard a mob
was marching to Stockton and took a
car thither with some deputies. He
met the strikers and read his proclamation
, eventually persuading them not to
enter the city limits. They turned to
Crystal Ridge, but he headed them off
and with difficulty dispersed them.
Continuing his story, he told how, on
the followin day( Thursday), he dispersed
some strikers at Cranberry.
Then he got word of a mob at Beaver
Meadow and went there. The mob
charged on the deputies, and they had
to push them away with their guns
held like rails. The sheriff then added
that one man fired upon the deputies as
the crowd dispersed and made good his
escape.
Friday afternoon he got a message
that the strikers were marching through
Cranberry, bound for Lattimer. He hurried
to West Hazleton and met the
strikers there. After a great deal of
difficulty he persuaded them to scatter,
the mob cursing him all the time. They
left the road, he said, and went over
some lots. Soon he heard they were going
to Lattimer.
" I hurried off with my deputies," he
continued," to intercept them. I told
them again to keep cool and not to
shoot unless their lives or mine were in
danger. After lining them up alongside
the road I told them I would go
out to meet the strikers and try once
more to disperse them. A deputy asked
if he should not go with me.' No,' I
said,' I'll go alone.' I thought one man
was enough to die at once. I felt some
how there was going to be trouble.
met the strikers about 50 yards from
the deputies and asked them where
they were going.
"" To stop the Lattimer breaker,' a
lot of them cried.
" I told them they must not go, and
tried to read my proclamation to them,
but they crowded around me, swearing
at me and hustling me to one side. One
man tried to grab me, and I then attempted
to get hold of him, but the
crowd jumped on me and pounded me
about the body. I dropped my paper
and pulled my revolver.
One of the
men tried to snatch the revolver from
failed. Then he struck
me, but me an
awful blow in the face and knocked me
to my knees. I tried to shoot him, but
my revolver would not explode. Then
the shooting commenced. It lasted
about half a minute. In the crowd I
saw three men armed with revolvers
and one with a knife. The latter made
a stab at me, but missed. Two men
were shot just behind me to the left. I
was in the direct line of fire."
The cross examination, conducted by
Mr. Scarlet, lasted for two hours and
will be resumed. While many minor
details were brought, nothing was
adduced to affect the main out story.

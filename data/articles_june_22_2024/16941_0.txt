At the mines, Lynch law was supreme. When
a man is caught stealing, a jury is chosen, the
evidence heard, and should he be convicted,
is immediately flogged and driven away from the
mines.
The health of the persons working at the
mines has been very bad. Fever and chills have
prevailed to a great extent.

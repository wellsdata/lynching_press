Point Out
Slain Man
As Warning
Indianapolis, Ind., March 24.-On
the heels of the report that an In-
dianapolis mob lynched a man at the
Casino Garden grove, one local dally
published a news article that the al-
leged lynching should serve
as a
warning to other residents of the
town who are of the same Race as
the man found dead.
Investigation after the discovery of
the dead man's body tended to show
that he had come to his death
through private murder. His name
was George Tompkins and he was 20
years old. He had been in this city
for two years, having come originally
from Kentucky.
A delegation of men called upon
Mayor Shank to inquire the necessity
of the white daily here referring to
the incident as a warning to any
group of people. It was pointed out
that the thought was slanderous and
that there were as many bad persons
in one race as in the other.
..
Tompkins' body was found under
tree. A grass rope hung to his neck
and was tied to two branches of the
tree. His hands were fastened he
hind him. His feet were on the
ground. This fact seemed enough to
scout the lynching theory and the
fact that he had his hands tied dis-
credited any thought that he had
rommitted suicide.

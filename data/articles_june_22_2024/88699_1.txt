TROOPS ON WAY.
St. Paul, Minn., June 15.- Two companies
of the Sixth infantry, Minnesota
National Guard, were ordered tonight
to proceed to Duluth, and a train due
to leave here at 11:35 p. m. was held
for the assembling of the troops.
National guardsmen of the state are
in camp at Fort Snelling, and in a comparatively
short time after orders had
been issued by State Adjutant General
Rhinow, the troops were ready to
leave for Duluth.
In the meantime, General Rhinow
ordered a company of home guards at
Duluth mobilized, and gave instructions
for commandeering of such ammunition
and guns as could be obtained
, for use in an effort to

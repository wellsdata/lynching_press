11-A new county grand jury
aas been given special instruc-
tions to investigate the recent
abduction and lynching of
Cord Cheek, 19 year old Negro, and
to "promptly indict" the perpetra-
tors if their identity could be deter-

mined.
Cheek was hanged December 15th
in Maury County, near Columbia,
after that county's grand-jury had
failed to return an indictment, fol-
lowing his arrest on a charge of at-
tempting to attack a white girl. He
had been held in the Nashville jail,
but was released when the Maury
grand jury failed to act.
He was
abducted here a few hours after his
release.

"I want you to exercise your in-
quisitorial power to the fullest ex-
tent," Judge Gilbert continued, "to
determine what acts in connection
therewith transpired in Davidson
County and who the perpetrators
were, and to properly indict such
person or persons.
"I can readily understand the dif-
ficulty that you will experience in
obtaining testimony, because of the
very nature of the offense, but re-
gardless of this I want you to know
that you will have every assistance
the court can give you in making
a sincere and vigorous effort to ap-
prehend the guilty parties."
It has just occurred to us that
they can christen ships with the
real stuff now.

Grand Jury Reports.
The grand jury called by Judge Car
ponter at Laramie a few days ago has
filed their report. They recommend
improvements in the jail and say that
they found indictments where the evidence
warranted. The Laramie Republican
is of the opinion that the evidence
in the lynching of the negro a few
ago was not sufficient to fasten
weeks the blame upon any particular person.

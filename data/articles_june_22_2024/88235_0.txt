SHERIFF SHIPP FILES
HIS ANSWER.
His Attorney Takes Position That
Johnson Case Was Not Appealable
To the Supreme Court.
Washington, Oct. 17. SUpreme
court of the United States to
day, the Hon. Judson Harmon filed
the answer of Sheriff Shipp of ilam
ilton county, Tennessee, and nine
deputies to the charge of contempt
laid by the supreme court in connection
with the lyncing in Chattanooga
last March of a negro named Ed
Johnson after the court had granted
an appeal in his case. He takes the
position that Johnson's case was poti
appealable, and that therefore the su-
court was without jurisdiction.
but that if the court had jurisdiction,
Shipp and his subordinates were not
guilty, as they exercised due diligence
to pervent the lynching. Shipp was
in the court room, but none of his
deputies were present.
The seventeen other defendants in
the case charged with participation
in the lynching, also filed their answers
through attorneys, denying the
act charged and asking to be dis
charged from custody. One of the
alleged lynchers was present in per
son.
The court took the matter under ad-
visement.
Among those in attendance is Judge
McReynolds, of the criminal court of
Hamilton county, where Johnson, the
negro, who was lynched, was tried
and convicted.
Judge McReynolds said that the im-
ression that the people of Chattan
nooga condemned Sheriff Shipp andrie
were doubtful as to Johnson's guilt,
was wrong, and, on the contrary, the
stood
voters of Hamilton county
sheriff. He considered the
with the
e- election of Sheriff Shipp by a ma
ority of fifteen hundred as conclusive
of how he stood in the com-
evidence munity.

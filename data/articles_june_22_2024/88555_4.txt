Two Statesmen of Tallapoosa.
Hon. Thomas L. Bulger and former
State Senator William M. Lackey of
Dadeville are at the Metropolitan hotel.
They will proceed this morning to We
tumpka to act as counsel for the defense
of the members of the recent lynching
mob of Elmore county who have been
indicted for complicity in that notorious
violation of the law. It will be recalled
that the Elmore grand jury indicted ten
men of the thirty and odd who are alleged
to have lynched a negro man for assault
upon a white woman some weeks ago; a
in which Governor Jelks took immediate
case and active interest.

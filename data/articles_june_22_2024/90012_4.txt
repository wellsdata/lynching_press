Must Be Stamped Out.
[ Laporte Journal]
Indiana has been disgraced by lynching.
While the crime of Turley was a cold- blooded
one, the men who took the law into their own
hands and lynched him have no valid excuse
for their action. This species of crime is becoming
too prevalent and should be dealt with
the severest manner possible, to the end that
in it may be stamped out.

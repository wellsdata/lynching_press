Wholesale Jail Delivery.
Marion. Led by Charles Jones, a
desperate negro murderer, twelve prisoners
made their escape from the jail
here and went down the lake into the
swamps. Ten of the escapes are negroes
and two are white men, but Jones is
the only important prisoner.
The men sawed out of their cells and
broke through the brick wall. Sheriff
Lewis kept a negro watchman at the
jail, but the watchman was asleep. He
woke up as the last man got through
the hole. By the time he got to Sheriff
Lewis' house and raised the alarm the
prisoners had disappeared.
Sheriff Lewis organized a posse of
twenty- five men and sent to Earle for
bloodhounds.
The dogs did not get
here before midnight, and in the meanwhile
the man hunt went on on both
sides of the lake.
Jones assassinated A. H. Ferguson,
an aged merchant, in his store here De-
cember 9. The crime was most revolting
in nature. A mob formed to lynch
the negro, but the sheriff took his prisoner
to' Memphis for safe keeping
,
bringing him back here after the
citement had subsided. ex-

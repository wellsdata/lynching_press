Reward for Murderer Carter.
The governor has offered a reward of
$ 200 for the arrest and delivery to the
sheriff of Baxter county of Bert Carter,
who was under sentence to hang De
cember 21 next for the murdur
of J. W. Wilson, a wealthy stock
man, on December 28 last, and who,
on October 22 last, was liberated from
the Baxter county jail by a mob. A
reward of$ 200 each for the arrest and
conviction of the mob is also offered.
Carter made a confession under promise
of leniency, implicating his father, An
derson Carter, and Bud Montgomery in
the murder. On February 26 last old
man Carter and Montgomery were
taken from jail at Mountain Home by
a mob and lynched. Young Carter
was afterward( and notwithstanding
his confession, which was excluded
from the testimony, but which was
well known to the jury) convicted and
sentenced to be hung December 21. He
is only 22 years old, and the mob which
released him evidently believed that
had been led into making a confes
he by the promise of being let off.

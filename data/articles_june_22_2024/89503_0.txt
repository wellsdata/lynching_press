BY ALABAMA MOB AT BUTLER
MURDERER OF BUSH LYNCHED
Mobile, December 6.- Dangling from the,
limb of a tree, the body of Azariah Cur-
tis, a young negro, was found Friday
morning at Butler, as mute evidence that
the murder of B. B. Bush, a highly respected
planter of this section, who was
shot to death, Monday had been avenged.
The lynching followed a confession by
Curtis, who stated that he with two
other negroes had waylaid Mr. Bush
and killed him, belleving him to be one
of two men whom they intended to rob
and who was supposed to have a large
sum of money in his possession. Three
other negroes are held in jail in connection
with the crime.

driven his daughter there, to resume
her duties as school teacher. From the
negro Curtis' confession it was learned

Rudders' bridge on Ticabum creek, for
the purpose of holding up and robbing
Tax Collector T. B. Bennett and J. F.
Howangton, the latter having been to
Demopolis to sell cotton, and both of
whom were known to possess large sunis
of money.
When Mr. Bush drove along the side
of the cotton house, Curtis stepped out
and fired, the load of shot from a single
barreled shotgun struck him in the back
of the neck. Mules
attached to the
wagon which Mr.
Bush was driving
ran away, but not until the negro had
fired twice more, each load striking the
victim.
When the negroes were placed in jail
the sheriff and deputies went out in
search of further evidence to convict
them when the case came to trial. A
mob of about 200 men formed and took
the negro Curtis, who confessed to firing
the shots to a place in the woods near
where the crime was committed
strung him up to the limb of a tree and.

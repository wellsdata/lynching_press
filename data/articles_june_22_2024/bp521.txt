the Jews in sympathy with your
people in this extremity.
What I would emphasize, how-
ever, is the danger confronting
them by the spread of Hitlerism
in the United States. Here there
is a potentiality of the extension of
the mob spirit in a direction not
previously exercised. Here there
are millions of Germans and
their descendants, mostly law abid-
ing citizens, that is the pride of
the nation, yet when it is suggested
to many of them by the lying
propaganda that the Jews are the
cause of the world's ills, it will be
an easy matter to incite many of
them and other nationalities
fever heat and to advocate po-
grcms, the foreign word for our
lynching parties or massacres.
The virulence of the Jew hatred of
some of these fanatics (and so
many cthers harbor prejudice
against the Jews) that I fear it will
culminate in the advocacy of such
extreme measures and thus add to
the horrors of an already deplor-
able condition in a country of
equal rights (?). the pride of all
liberty loving people, yet ruled in
many instances and localities by
the mob.
In conclusion, recognition of
Governor Ritchie's effort to punish
the ringlenders in Maryland
should be made by the support of
every fair-minded man of every
race or creed, in striking contrast
to the censure that should be
heaped upon Governor Rolph of
California, the modern champion of
riotous administration of justice,
which he puts to shame, and dis-
graces his high office.
Very truly yours.

Dear Sir-As a native of Mary-
land I wish to register my indig-
nation over the recent lynching of
a Negro and the manifestation of
race hatred that precipitated this
violence and reversion to barbar-
ism, usually absent among the
people of that state.
Ere the horror of that brutal af-
fair had passed in the minds of
those who would destroy the last
vestige of racial prejudice and the
lynch law spirit in this country,
California duplicates the mob vio-
lence by lynching two culprits of
the white race.
This demonstrates the fact that
the notive for "swift justice" is not
necessarily a question of color,
albeit the truth that it is mostly
and numerically the preponderant
applied in this violent manner to
the Negro race. It is, perhaps,
superfluous to show through your
paper the unanimous sentiment of

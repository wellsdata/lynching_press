Every man is deeply interested in putting
down the mob spirit, for he knows not but
that he may be the next victim. So open
have men become in deflance of law that
they engage in a lynching without even
to conceal their
taking the precaution
faces. This shows a most deplorable and
dangerous disregard for the majesty of the
law. This indicates that public opinion is
often on the side of the lynchers. This
must not be- the people must condemn
such acts. The constitution guarantees
every man protection to life, liberty and
property, but how can this protection be
maintained when men take the law in
their own hands. Lynch law leads to anarchy
, and anarchy to overthrow of all
government. The press, pulpit and all
moral agencies cannot too severely condemn
mob and warn the people agains:
its legitimate law results.

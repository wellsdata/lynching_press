Colored People in Georgia
Approve Lynching
Athens, Ga., Sept. 26.- Negroes at
a mass meeting near Lexington, Ga.,
have indorsed the action of whites in
lynching Obe Cox, colored, accused of
attacking the wife of a white farmer.
The members of this meeting were
the scum of the town. The better
class of colored people were in no way
connected. They were all of the old
Negro. The white people here
crowd term them all" good niggers."

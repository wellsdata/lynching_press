DASTARDLY CRIME.
Negroe Kills White Woman After Attempting
Assault- May Lynch.
Chattanooga, Tenn., August 23- Mrs.
Charles Williams, wife of a prominent
farmer of Franklin county, Tennessee,
was shot and killed today by Henry
Noles, a negro, who attempted to criminally
assault her. After shooting Mrs.
Williams the negro fired upon her little
son, grazing his head. Sheriff Stewart
and a posse with two bloodhounds are
in pursuit of the negro. It is thought
he will be caught before morning and it
is possible that he will be lynched, as excitement
is very high over the crime.
Mrs. Williams belonged to one of the
oldest most prominent families in
that section and of the State.

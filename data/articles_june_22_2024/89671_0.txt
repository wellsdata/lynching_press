MOB BENT ON LYNCHING
THE URBANA TRAGEDY MAY BE REPEATED
AT HUNTSVILLE, ALA.
Where Militiamen Are Guarding Two
Negroes from an Expected Attack
by Frenzied White Men.
BIRMINGHAM, Ala., June 10 .-- Hunts-
ville may be the scene of a bloody riot before
to- morrow's sun rises. A mob from
Decatur is bent on lynching Louis Thomp-
son and Walter Neville, the two negroes
who assaulted Nellie Lawton, a twelve-
year- old girl, at that place, and who were
taken to Huntsville for safe- keeping last
night. They are now in jail at Huntsville,
and troops guard the place. Early this
morning a mob of two hundred boarded a
freight train at Decatur to ride to Hunts-
ville for the purpose of lynching the ne-
groes. Ten miles out at Greenbrier Station
the conductor side- tracked the train
and acquainted the railroad officials with
the situation by wire. The latter telegraphed
back to hold the train until the
mob left it. After two hours of parleying,
the members of the mob got off and walked
back to Decatur, but swore they would
go to Huntsville to- night and carry
their purpose. out
Decatur is greatly wrought up over the
crime of the two negroes, both of whom
were identified by their victim. On preliminary
trial, yesterday, they were bound
over to the grand jury. To prevent lynching
the officer secreted them in the bathroom
of Hotel Bismarck until the train was
ready to leave for Huntsville, when the
two negroes were hurried by a back way
just in time to escape a gathering mob.
At Huntsville, which is forty miles from
Decatur, they were jailed. Both
protest their innocence. negroes

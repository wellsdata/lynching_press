West Indians Protest U.S.
Atrocities Against Negroes
TRINIDAD, B.W.I-The univer-
sal searchlight of human rights
kept its beam on America last
week as 5,000 British West Indians
jammed this city's Woodford
Square, expressing their indigna-
tion at the lynchings of American
Negroes.
Called by the Negro Welfare
Cultural and Social Organization,
he protest meeting reviewed Amer-
ica's long calendar of massacres
since V-J Day while an angry au-
dience shouted its resentment to
Freeport, N.Y., Birmingham, Mon-
roe, Ga., Columbia, Tenn., Bates-
burg, S.C., and the long list of
Hitler-like crimes.
Extending their greetings to
American fighters for freedom, the
assembly unanimously adopted a
resolution, which stated:
we feel that if the Negroes
of America can firetone bullet for
American imperialism, they can
fire ten for their own emancipa-
tion."
"Death To The Lynchers"
Referring to the
medley of
atrocities suffered by Negro Amer-
icans, the resolution continued,
"We view these actions as similar
to those committed by Hitler's ges-
tapo, and though the world had
fought to be free, abuses and in-
justices still continue and give
birth to the same child, that these
acts constitute the sting of Amer-
ican imperialism and un-mask the
Statue of Liberty, the Bill of
Rights... and the Four Freedoms."
The islanders voiced their ap-
proval of the resolution with re-
sounding shouts of "death to the
lynchers."

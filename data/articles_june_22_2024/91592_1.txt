WERE BEATEN TO DEATH.
An Aged Woman and a Man Killed in a
Brutal Manner.
COLUMBIA, S. C., Dec. 5.- News of a
dastardly lynching which occurred in this
State last Monday night reached here tonight
. It took place in Colleton County,
near the Barnwell and Hampton lines, and
was not known generally in that vicinity
until Wednesday morning, when the dead
bodies of two victims, stripped of their
clothing, were found, one being an old
woman. They had been taken out and
beaten to death with buggy- traces. The
man's offense was that he was suspceted of
having stolen a Bible and some furniture
from a church, and the woman's offense
being that she was supposed to know
something of it. Liquor seems to be
only incentive to the deed. the

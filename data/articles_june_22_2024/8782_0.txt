" I'm going to my rest and I'll find

Others of the condemned 13 were
granted stays of reprieves in the last
few weeks.
Before Frank Zagar, twenty- one-
year- old murderer of two, went to the
gallows Friday, bitterly cursing society
, he said:
" I will get justice when I cross the
border to the other world."
He crossed the order at 8:17
o'clock, according to the jailer's watch.
He died on the same gallows where
the crimes of Frank Campione and
John Henry Reese were expiated
Thursday.
Zagar, when he went to trial on May
1 of this year, took the witness stand
before Judge Sabath and surprised
the court by announcing that he had
committed two, not one, murders. He
said he needed spending money and
chose this manner of getting it.
" Where were you on the night of
April 15 when Polidaris Serdakis was
killed and Spiris Kalzouros was
wounded?" the judge asked.
" I was right there in Burnham," Za-
gar answered." And I bumped Serda-
kis off and shot his friend. And
what's more, I croaked another fellow
that same night."

when a Georgia mob lynched her
husband two years ago, and the
latter's daughter. Doris, who re-
turned from Moscow recently, de-
fined in a petition their meaning

As explained by them, genocide

is any of several acts "committed
with intent to destroy, in whole ori

to commit genocide. Mr. Robe-
son's application for a passport
to tralvel 10 Europe and attend
the UN meeting in Paris was de- ;

Dr. Raphael Lemkin, the Yale
University professor who helped
sponsor the United Nations Geno-
cide Convention, blasted the 240-
page petition to the world-organ-

cused of committing genocide)
against Negroes.
"This is a maneuver." Dr. Lem-
kin said. "to divert attention from
the crimes of genocide committed
against Estonians. Latvians, Lith-
uanians. Poles and other Soviet-!
subjugated peoples."
Harlem leaders and others ac-
tive in the role of "leadership"
among Negro Americans had not
issued any statements on the
charges made by Patterson and
Robeson when the Amsterdam
News went to press.

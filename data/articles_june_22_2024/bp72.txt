Attorney General Says
Wrong Man Was Lynched
By Mob; Keep Up Probe
MONTGOMERY,
Alu..â€”(SNS)-
While Sheriff J. L. Corbiit was de-
nying before the Alabama supreme
court Saturday that he had not
been negligent or cowardly in con-
nection with the lynching of Wes-
ley Johnson, colored, Attorney Gen-
cral Carmichael was charging that
the wrong nian was lynched by the
mob said to have wrested the sus-
pect from the sheriff now on trial.
Even though, the sheriff denied
any part in the lynching, he named
nine white men, all whom had been
listed earlier in court records as
having been seen in the Henry
County jall at Abbeville the night
of February 1, when Wesley John-
son, charged with criminally at-
lacking a white woman, was taken
by force and shot and hanged.
In charging that the mob lynch-
ed the wrong man, the attorney
general declared he had proof to
tack up his statement.
Sheriff Corbitt made his state-
ment from the witness stand as de-
fendant in an Impeachment trial.
Charges against him were ordered
filed by Governor Graves.
It was indicated that the state
would continue its probe with hope
of convicting the accused parties.

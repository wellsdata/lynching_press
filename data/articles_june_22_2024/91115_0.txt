MOB NEGRO
Talledega, Ala., October 3.- The
first lynching of a Negro by Ne-
took place in Talladega

an unidentified Negro attacked a
woman of his race and fled.
The Negroes traced him to a
point nine miles from Lincoln,
where he was captured and later
identified by the woman who was
attacked. His captors then proceeded
to string him up and riddle
the body with bullets and shot.
Talladega County deputies, with
a Coroner, went to the scene, and
at the inquest the verdict was that
" the deceased was unknown and
to his death at the hands of
came persons unknown to the jury."

Sir: While recent lynching of a
Negro at Hawkinsville, Georgia is
still fresh in our memories. an-
other Negro has been lynched in
Houston, Texas. Of course, there
will be the usual "investigation"
of this heinous incident by local
authorities. But the ultimate re-|

complete whitewash.

I have never been more convinc-
ed than now that, as far as Ne-
groes are concerned. a third ma-
jor political party in this country 3
offers the quickest and best so-
lution to our many unsolved prob-
lems.
I'm exceedingly happy to be in-
formed that Congressman Adam
Clayton Powell, Jr. has announc-
ed his intention to work for the
establishment of such a party.
Congressman Powell is eminently
qualified for this very important
assignment. His ability, courage
and trustworthiness are unques-
tionable and far above reproach.
In all matters relative to equal
rights and privileges for Negroes,
ne is one of the most prominent
rusaders of our time. He needs
and eserves the fullest upport
and unwavering confidence of
every Negro in America. Lots of
luck and more power to him.

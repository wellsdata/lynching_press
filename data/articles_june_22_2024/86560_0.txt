John Paul Logan, of St. Paul,
Minn ,, has the following card in the
Chicago Times of last week:
" I will pay$ 1,000 reward to any
mob who will lynch a white man for
murdering a negro in the South or
for assaulting a negro woman in the
South. The daily lynching of ne-
groes is like the handle of a jug -all
on one side. Just to vary the monotony
and see a refreshing change,
I will send the above amount to any
enterprising Southern mob who will
change the programme for once and
give a white murderer a piece of rope.
I suggest that the county sheriff
where they operate should be elected
captain of the mob, and authorized
to draw on me for the$ 1,000, which
will be paid' spot cash' at the First
National Bank of St. Paul immediately
upon receipt of credible information
that the mob has changed the
programme.' I am heartily disgusted
with your' nigger' corpses. Now
let your irrepressable, great Ameri-
can mob bestir themselves and give
us one white corpse for breakfast, and
the very deyils hell will rise up
and thank them in."

house only a few days before the
Decatur trials. It was at this time
that the Kilby warden, who always
referred to the boys as the" rape
niggers," struck Patterson in the face
with the keys. Patterson was the
most militant of the nine framed
youths.
In Decatur the boys were kept in
a jail condemned for use by white
prisoners. It was openly stated that
the jail was" only good enough for
niggers." Despite the constant danger
of lynch mobs seizing the boys.
they were kept in this dungeon
which could be broken into with a
spoon," according to the New York
Times.
Several meetings were called by
" vigilante" committees of wealthy
whites and Ku Klux Klan members
in towns about Decatur to organize
a march on the jail and lynch the
boys. One of these mobs actually
surrounded the courthouse during an
interview between Samuel Leibowitz,
defense attorney for the I. L. D., and
Haywood Patterson. The lives of
both were in danger. The crowd was
finally persuaded to disperse by the
sheriff.
The sense of being constantly
threatened with lynching wore the
boys down, Brodsky states. Upon
seeing his mother for a few minutes
during the trial, Haywood broke
down and declared he was" afraid of
what's going to happen to me" if
lynch crowds continued to grow. the

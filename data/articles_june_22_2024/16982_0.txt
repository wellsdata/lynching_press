A correspondent of the Marysville Express, writing
from Centreville. Grass Valley, says:" One of the most
horrid murders was committed on the person of William
Scobee last Monday night. He had a store at Jones's Bar.
on Bear river. A party of men entered his house, inflicted
several wounds with some sharp instrument; one penetrated
the skull which no doubt ended his existence. He
was rolled in blankets and thrown into the river, where
he was afterwards found. To- day three men are lodged
in jail at Auburn by Messrs. Hutchin on. Price and some
ten or twelve others, after an examination before a magistrate
. They will have their trial to- morrow. You may
expect to hear of more lynch law, for if it is evident that
they are guilty, nothing will save their lives. One of the
men having long whiskers. Mr. Hutchison recognized as
one of the men that robbed him on Sunday last.

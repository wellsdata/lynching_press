PROBE LYNCHING
OF MEXICAN BOY
Cameron, Tex., June 23. Warrants
have been issued for four persons suspected
of having been membors of the
mob which early this week hanged a
13- year- old Mexican lad at Thorndale,
Tex., near here. This became known
here, following a secret session today
of the court of inquiry convened by
English to investigate the
Judge
lynching
More warrants probably will
.
be issued. The names of the four sus-
have not been made public
pects.
At the secret court session held today
Eduardo Velardo, Mexican vice consul
at San Antonio, was in attendance.
Scores of residents of the little town
of Thorndale were in the city. Numbers
of these, it is expected, will be
summoned to appear and give testi-
commony at the inquiry. The known determination
of the authorities to make
a most searching examination into ev-
circumstance cor nected with the
ery
lynching has aroused great interest in
proceedings and made
this
the was
greater today by the fact that the sessions
were held behind closed doors.
Three arrests were made this afternoon
in connection with the lynching.
Those taken into custody were Ezra
Stephens, Z. P. Gorr. Jr., and Harry
Winchus. Twenty witnesses have been
examined with 17 others still waiting

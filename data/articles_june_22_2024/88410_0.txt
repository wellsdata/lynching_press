Since writing you I have received the following
from the sheriff at Walsenberg:
Last night while conveying prisoners
from Rouse to Walsenberg an armed mob
held up the posse and killed the driver and
one prisoner. Two prisoners ran and have
not since been found. Don't know
whether they were killed or not. This oc.
curred about 7p. m. At 1 a. m. the mob
broke into jail and shot to death
two prisoners implicated in the same
murder. All were Italians except the
driver." On receipt of which I have telegraphed
him as follows: Wire me at
once whether you are maintaining order
and protecting prisoners, and whether you
have sufficient force to prevent a recurrence
of violence to the prisoners. Take every
precaution to protect life and property, and
as soon as possible ascertain who composed
the mob which did the lynching, and as
soon as practicable arrest them," to which
I received the following reply:
Everything is quiet tonight. Will wire
particulars in the morning. Have not
found the two prisoners that got away at
the time they were being held up by
mob." the

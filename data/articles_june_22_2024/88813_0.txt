An Attempted Lynching in Ohio Proves
Disastrous.
TIFFIN, O., October 28.- City Marshal
Shultz went the country home of J. J.
Martin to arrest him for attempted
assault on his brother- in- law. On the
way to town Martin managed to draw
a revolver and killed Shultz. Martin
was placed in jail and after Shultz's
funeral a mob gathered to lynch him.
Sheriff Van Nest and three guards
warned the mob back, but they broke
down the doors and proceeded to the
grating. Then the guards fired killing
two of the leaders, one of whom carried
a rope. The mob gathered up the
dead and dispersed. The local militia
was called out and to prevent further
trouble Governor McKinley called out
four companies. Martin was moved to
Fremont. Further trouble is
pated. antici-

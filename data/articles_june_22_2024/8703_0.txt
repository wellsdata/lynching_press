The Raleigh Post prints the following
dispatch from Goldsboro, interesting
if true: The negro, D. B.
Jones, who was thought to have
been lynched in LaGrange some time
ago for an assault upon a white lady
the town, turned up yesterday
in near Snow Hill, charged with forcible
BY AN ANARCHIST.
TWO BULLETS TAKE EFFECT- WOUNDS
SERIOUS, POSSIBLY FATAL.
Terrible Crime at the Pan- American Exposition
- The Would- be Assassin Captured and
Narrowly Escaped Lynching- He Is a Pole
and Remains Calm- Great Sorrow Throughout
America and the World.
BUFFALO, N. Y., Sept. 6.- 4: 30 p.m.-
This evening in the Temple of Music
President McKinley was shot twice
by an Anarchist during the reception
The man had a handkerchief wrapped
around his hand in which a pistol
was concealed. The first ball entered
the President's chest and glanced;
the second ball entered the abdomen
and turned downward. The first
has been extracted.
The President was instantly conveyed
to the hospital, where he is
now resting and is conscious. He
called his secretary to his bedside
and is now dictating instructions
and his last wishes in case the wound
should prove fatal. An immense
throng ran after the assassin, who
would have been lynched but for the
interference of police guards.

HAWESVILLE( Ky.), Sept. 26.- In
the broad, open glare of a Sunday morning
, in the midst of a revival, not a
mask to be seen and in the presence of
800 infuriated people, Raymond Bush-
rod, a negro, this evening at 5 o'clock
was made to pay the penalty of his assault
on fourteen- year- old Maggie Rob-
erts. He was swung from a limb in the
Courthouse yard.
Bushrod yesterday afternoon, three
miles below town, encountered Maggie
Roberts, daughter of Ben Roberts, a
prominent farmer. He not only brutally
assaulted the girl, but beat her with
an iron coupling pin and left her on
the railroad grade to die. The news of
the outrage spread and searching parties
were sent in every direction. He
was captured in hiding at Falcon, four
miles below the scene of the crime by
four of the posse. He was brought to
Hawesville and surrendered to the
jailer, while the town was deserted
searching for him. In the meantime the
officers got wind of a mob and he was
secretly guarded in the graveyard on the
hill until morning, when he was again
locked up.
But the people were determined.
Early they came afoot on horseback in
,,
wagons, and in trains. They were impatient
for darkness to cover the
ground. It was rumored that militia
would arrive at 4:40 from Owensboro
for his protection. The angry crowd
would not stand this and they placed
trusty sentinels on the hill overlooking
town to give a sign if the train bore
such protection. They failed to come,
but at this time the
officers thought it
opportune to play a ruse and the mob,
now furious, were led to believe that
he had escaped from behind and a hot
pursuit followed. The trail was followed
only a square, when the broad
open attempt to spirit Bushrod over the
hills and out of town was discovered.
A few well chosen guards, however,
staid at the jail, and as he was brought
out the mob formed front and the officers
were forced to yield. The excitement
at this time was intense. Promptly
at 5 o'clock the march to the Courthouse
square was begun. Halting in
front of a great poplar with limbs and
twigs overhanging the
most public
street in town, a selection was made.
Some delay was caused for want of a
rope, but directly a new half inch plow
line was furnished and
everything was
in readiness for the first lynching in
Hancock County.
In the meantime Bushrod was given
an opportunity for confession and
prayer.
His confession was complete.
He said he was guilty and that this was
the third offense, one successful effort
had been made upon his 60- year- old
aunt. After offering up his last supplication
, a long and fervent prayer, the
signal to haul away was given, and with
pinioned arms and legs he was dangled
between brick and tree. The applause
as he went up was deafening.
In about four minutes he was pronounced
dead and Coroner Mitchell,
claiming the body, cut it down and summoned
a jury, whose verdict was that
Bushrod came to his death at the hands
of unknown parties.
After the lynching the mob's leader
made a little talk. He pointed to the
corpse and said:" Here is the protection
we offer our wives and daughters."
When he committed the assault,
rod was drunk. Bush-

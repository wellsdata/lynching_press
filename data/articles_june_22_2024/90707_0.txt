Ohio Official Gets Loving Cup For Defending
Man From Mob.
The National Association For the Advancement
of Colored People on Dec. 30
presented a loving cup to Sherman
Eley, county sheriff at Lima, O. The
trophy was given in recognition of Sheriff
Eley's bravery in defending a colored
man accused of a crime or misdemeanor
from being lynched by a mob
of white people. This is the first time
that a sheriff of any county has been
so honored, it is said.
The inscription on the loving cup
reads," For devotion to duty in defending
colored prisoner from lynching,
enduring torture and insult, that the
majesty of the law might be upheld, at
Lima, Aug. 30, 1916." The presentation
of the cup was made by Governor
Frank B. Willis before a crowd that
filled the Second Baptist church. He
said that the world loves and appre-
ciates a man who stands squarely with
a heart unafraid and his face to the
front at times of stress and that public
appreciation never is small for the
faithful official who stands for the administration
of the law and the
forcement of justice. en-

SHERIFF FREEMAN'S
EMPHATIC ANSWER
Denver, Colo., Nov. 26.- The dailies
this morning publish the answer of
Sheriff Freeman of Lincoln county, to
the letter of District Attorney McAllis
ter asking him to arrest the lynchers of
John Porter. In his answer, Sheriff
Freman says:
" Under the laws of this state neith-
neither rape nor murder is punishable
by death, nor are rape and murder
combined punishable by death under
the law, and yet every man of common
sense knows who was at all familiar
with the horrible particulars of the
rape of Louise Frost and her fiendish
murder, that the citizens of Lincoln
county would not wait for the slow
processes of the law and the wholly in-
adequate punishment that would come
as a result of a conviction under the
law.
" The men who took Preston Porter
from my custody were citizens of Lin
coln county and personally known to
you and to other officials of the district
and state. The lodging of informations
against them and the trial of them for
lynching the prisoner would be wholly
fruitless, and would impose upon the
county an enormous expense without
any beneficial results whatsoever.
" I have no desire to avoid any re-
sponsibility, but do not intend to make
a grandstand play in order to set my-
self right in the eyes of yourself or
Governor Thomas, or those citizens
who were pleased to meet in Denver
and pass resolutions after the lynching
had taken place.
" If that meeting of preachers and
lawyers, politicians and sentimentalists
at Coliseum hall had been held before
the lynching the lynching might have
probably been defered for a period of
ten or twelve days. You certainly
know that no jury could be impaneled
in Lincoln county, or by change of
El Paso
venue in Douglass county,
county, Kit Carson county, or Teller
county, which would convict any one
under any conceivable charge that
might brought against him of complicity
be in this lynching."

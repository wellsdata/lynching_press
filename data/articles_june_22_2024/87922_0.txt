CONDITION GROWS WORSE
Mayflower Desperado Declares Killing
of Collinston( La.) Mayor
was Accidental.
A special to the Arkansas Gazette
from Shreveport late last night
says:
Lee Blount, the Arkansas desperado
, in jail here charged with the
murder of Mayor H. W. Vaughn of
Collinston, La., following the robbery
of the Bank of Collinston by Blount
and" Shorty" Defts Wednesday, maintains
the attitude of stoical philosophy
that has characterized his en-
tire criminal career. His two narrow
escapes from death- one from the
posse that captured him and later
from a mob that sought to lynch
him- have left him unmoved. He
shows only faint interest in the prospect
of legal execution that stares
him in the face.
At 11 o'clock tonight Sheriff
Hughes had Blount removed to the
Charity hospital, where he might
receive the medical attention of which re
lhe is badly in need. Dr. W. P. Butler
, who attended him on his arrival,
visited him again tonight, and thinks
now that his chances for recovery
are much less than they
appeared
this morning. Blood poisoning de-
veloped this afternoon from the
wound in the stomach, and Blount
grew worse rapidly.
Before leaving the jail he gave
Hughes his wife's address. As he
went through the door he told the
sheriff he had been in just as bad a
fix, if not worse, before, and had
pulled through, and that he was not
afraid of this one, but just to be on
the safe side he gave the address.
A special deputy was placed to
watch the prisoner- patient.
Blount had a narrow escape from
being lynched by a party of men at
Bastrop yesterday. After being captured
Collinston
near, Blount
was
taken to Bastrop to have his wounds
dressed. Officers learned that a mob
was forming to lynch the prisoner
and they hurried him out of town.
The mob pursued and the officers
fled into the woods west of town.
They remained in hiding all after
noon and night and reached here
with the prisoner this morning.
During the night while the officers
listened with anxious ears for sounds
of the pursuers, Blount was the coolest
member of the party. However,
he pleaded with one of the deputies,
asking that if the mob overtook
them that he be given a revolver.
" I won't hurt any of you boys and
I won't try to get away if I'm not
killed," he said." I promise that,
and I never broke a promise in my
life. If they catch up with us, just
give me a gun, stand me up with my
back to tree and I'll shoot it out
to the a last cartridge with those

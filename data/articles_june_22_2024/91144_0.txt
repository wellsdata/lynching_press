Jackson, Ga., Dec. 15 .-- William
Turner, a Negro preacher, was
hanged by du process of law in
Kenk's Opera House here yesterday
. Never before probably was
a formal sentence of death carried
out in a place of amusement. Tur-
uer was executed for having incited
a race riot, in which Jesse
Singley, a prominent planter, was
shot to death. In the private
boxes and frontrows of the opera
house yesterday many relatives
and those who were friends of
Singley were seated. Other parts
of the house were not crowded but
only because the sheriff refused
to issue many cards of admission,
for on the street a throng of whites
and Negroes knocked on the closed
doors and clamored for admission.
The sheriff posted a guard of his
deputies to restrain the crowd,
whose yearning to see the hanging
was triply intensified by its
The
staging sheriff had intend-
.
to carry out the law's mandate
in the jail yard, but he was rather
apprehensive that the crowd break
in. Besides, it was raining, the
weather was really very disagreeable
, so the sheriff decided to hang
Turner in the opera house that
those most deeply interested, Sing-
relatives might not be kept
standing ley's in the rain.

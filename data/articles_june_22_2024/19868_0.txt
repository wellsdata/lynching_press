Imprisoned for Another's Crime.
DENVER, Colo., July 20.- The Times
publishes a sensational story from
Grand Junction, which, if true, will
liberate John L. Campbell from the
penitentiary where he is now serving a
sentence of a lifetime. During the
year 1885 John L. Campbell and Sam
uel Jones were partners in a big cattle
ranch near Unaweep canon, Mesa county
, Colo. On the afternoon of May 19
Jones left the ranch on horseback for
Silverton, expecting to reach there
some time the next day. Several
hours later Campbell also left the cabin
for a distant part of their range. Jones
was never seen alive after leaving the
house and several days afterwards his
body was found in a lonely spot riddled
with the balls from a Colt's revolver.
Campbell was arrested for the murder
of his partner and though stoutly
maintaining his innocence, he was convicted
on circumstantial evidence and
sentenced to the penitentiary at Canon
City for thirty- three years. During
the trial, Bob and Ira Smith, two cow
boys, of the bad man with a gun"
order, were very zealous to fasten the
crime on Campbell, and were very in-
dignant that he should escape with his
life and organized mob to lynch him
but were frustrated a.

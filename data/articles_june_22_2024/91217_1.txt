MOB IN LOUISVILLE.
LOUISVILLE, May 14.- Four negroes who were accused
of the murder of the Joyce family, some
months since, were tried to- day and acquitted.-
One of the negroes turned State's evidence. but his
testimony not being legally corroborated failed to
convict the accused. At about dark a crowd of
people, which had been gathering since the rendition
of the verdict in the afternoon, broke into the
cannon house, got the cannon and placed it in front
of the jail. A number of shots were fired from
the Jail, and from the mob brickbats were hurled
at the Jail. The jailor fearing the escape of the
negroes surrendered two of them, who were taken
by the mob and hanged, the third took a razor and
cut his own. The negro who turned States
evidence was throat unmolested.

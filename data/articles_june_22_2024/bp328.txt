and stops being democratic right
then and there. There are, in fact,
numerous charges that even in-
duction methods are irregular in
the South. The Army puts
men into uniforms, which white;
civilians in Mississippi may dare,
without militarv interference, to
our
force them to take off. The Army
sends our men to foreign fronts to
unload barges, drive trucks and
cook meals for white soldiers, who
dare to criticize us for not being
allowed to fight.
IT IS my firm conviction that we
can do something about these
things if we do not continue to
Irely upon the Negro press to fight
the battle alone. The Army can
protect its uniform from ridicule
if we convince the Army that we
intend that it shail be protected.
There are all kinds of federal laws.

arranging for their defense. The
Army thinks we are foking when
we do nothing about the beating

leaders continue to sit out this
problem. meanwhile engaging in
esoteric discussion of the relative
value of this or that political strat-

the proper area for social and po-
litical action and fail to use our
real political weapon.

EANWHILE, in the relatively
space of time that re-
mains of armed conflict, with the
world talking even now about the
future, our organizational leaders
are spending most of their time
rehearsing their plans to leap from
the hosom of the New Deal into
the arms of Wendell Willkie. They
haggle over terms and discuss the
Negro vote as if it were a bolt of
goods which they will deliver at
the proper ti ne to the highest bid-
der. Naturally what happens next
year is important and who prom-
ises what is part of that picture.
But this problem is hot now and
it also may be considered political!
in the sense that its solution lies
in the hands of a Democratic ed-
ministration which will be up for
| re-election.

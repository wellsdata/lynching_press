always have been in the posses-
sion of the jailer and that many
times in the past when they have
been arrested, the arresting of
ficer can not lock them up until
he went to the home of the jailer
to get the keys.
This raises the question: If it
was customary for the jailer to
keep the keys in his possession,
how did it happen that the mob
which broke into the jail are re-
ported to have found the keys in-
side a metal box? Why didn't the
jailer have the keys with him?
This is the question one asks
only in a whisper here. But the
question still looms large in the
eyes of the FBI as they continue
to weave their net around the
town.
May Release Moody
Meanwhile, the turn of events
may bring the release from the
jail of C. J. Moody, a Negro who
occupied the cell next to M. C.
Parker and who saw members of
the mob take him from the cell.
Moody is charged with murder
and was scheduled to be tried
here this week but the Circuit
Court judge before whom he was
to be tried has adjourned all his
cases until the November term of |
court and has stated now that
Moody will be released in $3,500;
bail if he can find a bondsman.
There are no bondsmen in the
ity and Moody is in jail. But it is
presumed that his lawyer will in-
tercede for him.
In another turn of events, au-
horities are questioning a suspect

porters that the keys to the jail

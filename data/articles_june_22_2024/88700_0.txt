Scott Bishop
The beauties of mob rule or anarchy
are plentifully illustrated in the case
of Scott Bishop of Autauga county.
The final chapter in his case is thus
correspondent:
told by a
Scott Bishop is the negro who had been
reported lynched at Marbury in December
when he was caught. It was in evidence
today that the constable, W. J. Parrish,
had charge of Scott Bishop and on being
overtaken by a mob was overpowered and
relieved of the prisoner, and after going
some distance with. him, the prisoner
broke away from the mob and made good
his escape after receiving several minor
gunshot wounds. The prisoner went to
see his relatives in Bullock county and
on arriving there gave himself up to the
sheriff, at which place he was detained
until he was brought to Prattville this
week for his preliminary trial.
In other words, Judge Lynch came
within a hair of hanging an innocent
negro last year in Autauga, besides
one actually hung in Pike county. The
negro in Autauga county was liberally
supplied with gunshot wounds, before
or at the time he made his escape
mob. Out of four lynching
from a
bees in the state last year, two seized
innocent negroes. One was hung in Pike
county, and the other escaped from
a mob" after receiving several gunshot
wounds." Judge Lynch's record
in this state is not an enviable one.
Scott Bishop was brought last week
before a justice of the peace at Pratt-
ville, and a strong effort was made to
connect him with a murder committed
near Marbury. Many witnesses were
called, but in the end the court de-
was no evidence
cided that there
against him. Judge Lynch should stop
occasionally
and think.

HELD WITHOUT BAIL.
Mose Davis, Charged With Criminal
Assault at Waco.
Waco, Tex., July 23 .-( Special.)- Mose
Davis, colored, had a preliminary trial
today before Justice Earle and was committed
to jail without bail. The charge,
made by affidavit of the mother of the
girl, was criminal assault, the victim being
Marie Pease, aged 12, a relative of
the wife of the defendant. When Mose
was arrested last week the protection of
the officers was needed to restrain the people
of his own race from lynching him.
After being denied bail by the justice he
was taken back to jail under a strong
guard, headed by Constable Crowder.
and there were indications that the guard
was timely. Low muttered threats were
from colored men along the side-
heard walks.

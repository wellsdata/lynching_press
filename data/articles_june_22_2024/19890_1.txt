He was dragged out into the street
and taken to a bridge a short distance
away. A rope was put around his neck
and one end thrown over a cross piece of
the structure. When the mob were in the
act of pulling him up a shot from a
revolver parted the rope and the wretch
fell to the ground. But the mob were
determined that the wretch should die.
He was quickly picked up and hustled
the nearest telegraph pole, where
to the lynching was completed.

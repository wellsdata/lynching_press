MOB NEARLY GOT HIM
SLAYER OF A POLICEMAN MAY YET
BE LYNCHED.
CHESTER, Pa., Feb. 2.- Policeman
Mark Allen was shot and instantly killed
last midnight by Albert West, a negro
whom he had arrested for quarreling on
the street with a colored woman. The
negro shot Alien in the leg, and as he
fell to the sidewalk, fired two shots into
his body, death resulting shortly after.
West escaped, but was captured today
hiding in a stable at Darby, seven miles
from here. The news of the capture preceded
the arrival of the officers with their
prisoner, and when they reached the city
hall in a car a crowd of 2,000 persons met
them with cries of" Lynch him,"" Kill
"
him.
The negro was hustled into the city
hall, and the crowd, seeing that it was
impossible to reach him in the narrow
corridor, ran around to the courtyard in
the rear of the building. The big gate
was barred, but 100 shoulders were placed
against it, and it was torn down and
the mob rushed in with yells of"
him." Lynch
The city jail stands in this court yard,
and fearing, that a rush would be made
in that direction Chief Leary placed a
platoon of police in the driveway, and
the officers, with drawn revolvers, faced
the crowd, which sullenly retired. A plot
was made for a second onslaught, and it
was necessary to place the leaders
temporary custody to quiet the crowd. in

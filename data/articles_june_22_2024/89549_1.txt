Two Lynched in Nebraska.
GREELY CENTER, Neb., Dec. 28.- Word
was received here to- night that
Joseph and Dick Kruth, who murdered
Robert Kuntz, near Spaulding, and were
being brought to this place by the sheriff,
were lynched by a masked mob about
eighteen miles north of here. The sheriff
and his deputies were overpowered, the
report says, and the men were hanged to
a tree. The sheriff should have arrived
here this evening, and as nothing has been
heard from him it is thought the story
correct. is

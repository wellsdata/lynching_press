Ah! Mrs ... Felton, there is the
rub; the South would have slavery
and she must now pay the penalty,
and the time will surely come when
human blood will flow as freely
throughout the South as water, and
when that time does come you
Mrs. Felton will not be in favor of
lynching a thousand Negroes a
week for the edification of the
white ladies and gentle-
Christian men of the South.

We commend the law- abiding citizens
and officials of Memphis and Tennessee for
their prompt and vigorous action in the
recent horror which has added further disgrace
to the county of Shelby and the state
of Tennessee. Such lynching was a crime
against humanity, deserving the severest
penalty the law can inflict. and Memphis
will become the by- word and reproach of
nations should justice miscarry in this
instance. We bespeak the approval of the
civilized world and pledge the moral sup.
port of Des Moines for the people of Shelby
county, Tennessee, in meting out punishment
the murderers of those six helpless
Negroes to.

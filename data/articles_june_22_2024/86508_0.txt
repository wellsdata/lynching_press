FORT WORTH, Tex., June 3.- Efforts
to reach Kirwin, Tex., from here
by telegraph have proved fruitless and
it is believed that the wires have been
cut. In view of the reports previously
received that a race war had broken
out at Kirwin as an aftermath of the
lynching of negroes charged with as-
on a white girl, the situation is
sault considered ominous.

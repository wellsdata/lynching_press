NEGRO TROOPER
FACES COURT ON
SERIOUS CHARGE
TUCSON, Feb. 1.- After two days
spent in trying to secure a jury in the
case of the government vs. Robert
Mangum, charged with attacking an
army officer's wife at Ft. Huachuca
evidence was started in the case and
it will probably be concluded on
Thursday. It
was necessary to secure
a special venire of 20 jurors to
fill the panel after the first day's
work.
The Mangum trial, one having sensational
aspects, gives promise of
arousing more widespread attention
throughout the country than any
tried in Tucson in several years case, as
press representatives from large coast
dailies gathered early Tuesday and
were granted special place in the federal
court room by district Judge
William H. Sawtelle.
Well filled by tense audiences,
whose ears were strained to catch
every word passed, the court room
scene was one rarely observed in
cases going to trial in Tucson.
Ralph Langworthy, counsel for the
defendant, a negro, formerly connected
with the veterinary detachment
stationed at Fort Huachuca repeatedly
eliminated jurors as he queried
whether they had formed prejudices
in the case and whether their opinions
would be altered and influenced
by evidence produced in the court
room.
" Would you accept the testimony
of an egro as material evidence equal
to that of a white man?"
" Are you inclined to have prejudices
against a ngro accused of
rape?"
Such were samples of the list of
queries applied to each juror undergoing
examination. After a morning
spent in the attempt, a trial jury had
not been secured at two o'clock Tues-
day afternoon and preparations were
made for the opening of the afternoon
session.
Mangum was brought to Tucson
secretly in the month of July, 1921,
as rumors of mob violence and lynching
of the negro arose at Fort Hua-
chuca.
The negro soldier is alleged to have
been guilty of rape upon the wife of
an army officer at Huachuca, it being
charged he assaulted her in a canyon
on the military reservation.
Government authorities state that
they will produce testimony to show
that Mangum approached the woman
as she was riding horseback and that
she fell from the horse and was as-
saulted by the negro, a rescue being
made by another officer who heard
the screams of the woman from a distance
.
The defense of the negro is said to
be under the auspices of a colored
society, which has raised funds to be
used for the purpose of clearing
of the charge. him

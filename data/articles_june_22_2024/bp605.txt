Prepare Lynchers
ProsecutionProsecution
Oklahoma City, Okla., June-(ANP
Via Telegram Service)-Twelve white
men have been identified us members
of the mob who recently lynched Hen-
ry Argo, a half wit youth, in Chicka-
sha, and Negroes here and throughout.
the state are going to see that every
effort is made to convict them.
This fact became known Sunday
night when a large group of citizens
headed by Dr. W. A. J. Bullock, presi-
dient of the local chapter of the N.
A A. C. P., assembled in the office
of the Black Dispatch, Roscoc C. Dua-
gee, editor, to formulate definite plans
to aid in the prosecution. This con-
ference was devoid of oratory and
meaningless prattle but was devoted
to action.
Plans for the solicitation of funds
throughout the state were made.
Special counsel, composed of Attorneys
J. Q. A. Harrod nd Laynic Harrod,
beth veteran criminal lawyers, will
be employed, and the governor of the
state will be petitioned to change
venue as it is not believed that a con-
viction can be effected in Chickasha.
Attorneys here have stated that all
of the rioters are guilty of murder
under the Oklahoma Conspiracy Stat-
utes and the citizens are determined
that those men whose savagery caused
them to lynch an innocent youth and
cast a blot upon this whole state be
tried and convicted of murder. Many
here have rallied to the cause, and
1 is believed that others throughout
the state will join hands with them.
Another important development in
the case centers around the proposed
suit by the relatives of the slain boy,
for damages against Sheriff Mat San-
key, which will be filed in the Fed-
al Court. Sankey is charged with
being drunk at the time the boy was
killed and therefore violated the oath
of cffice.

Lynching Is
Murder Say
White Women
Southern Women
Score Evil In Convo
Held In Florida
JACKSONVILLE,
Fla. -- (AN
P)-Scoring the idea that lynching
of colored people in the South is at-
tributable to any idea of protect-
ings white womanhood, and declar-
ing boldly that "lynching is whole-
| sale murder." Florida's Council of
the Association of Southern Wo-
men for the Prevention of Lynch-
ing opened a two-day state confer-
ence here last week.
The opening session was open to
the public, and stirring tirades
against the South's peculiar system
of social and economic adjust-
ment were made before several
hundred white and colored listen-
ers. A one-act playlet, staged by
students of a local colored college,
was one of the features of the pro-
gram.
ATTACK COWARDICE
Several speakers portrayed the
hollow mockery of the policy of
hiding behind the petticcals of
Southern women in the perpetra-
tion of their sadistic orgies of death
and destruction. Lending force to
the attacks on the cowardice of
lynching was the fact that one
lynching has supposedly been pre-
vented in this state during the past
few days.
The closing meeting of the ses-
sion brought the adoption of a
broad program of anti-lynch action
on the parts of the women. The new
program calls for "prevention com-
mittees" in every one of Florida's
67 counties, and a widespread sys-
tem of education that will center
itself about the schools and col-
leges.

feature about the prisoner's story
is that he confesses to the murder of
the old Spaniard, Joaquim Boxama, for

mob August 8, 1896. A third Italian
was lynched at the same time, but he
was really a murderer. The lynching
became a subject of international correspondence
, which resulted in the
United States government having to
pay an indemnity of several thousand
dollars to the families of the
Italians. dead

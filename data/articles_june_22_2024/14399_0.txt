YOUNG GIRL IS MURDERED
UNKNOWN PERSON AND
BY BODY LEFT LYING IN POOL
Meridian, Miss., July 22 .-( Special.)-
One of the most harrowing and unprovoked
murders, so far as known, that
has ever occurred in Mississippi was dis-
covered this morning at Rural Hill in
Winston county when the dead body of
Miss Janie Sharp was found with her
throat cut from ear to ear and her head
almost beaten into a jelly and lying in a
pool of water.
It appears that the young lady went to
the postoffice at Rural Hill for the mail
late yesterday afternoon. She did not return
when expected and inquiry among
neighbors failed to locate her. A search
was at once instituted by the neighbors
and early this morning, about 4:30 o'clock,
her dead body was found by the roadside
with her head in a pool of water,
horribly mutilated and her throat cut
with a pocket knife.

The young lady was the daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. William Sharp, who are among
the most prominent people in Winston
was only 18 and was es-
county. She
pecially popular with the young people.
There were two young men who were
paying her especial attention.
As soon as the dead body of the young
girl was found the news spread over the
country and soon reached Louisville, the
county seat, where Judge George A. Mc-.
Lean of Winona was holding a term of
circuit court. Judge McLean, in order to
prevent summary justice, told the people
that if the guilty party was caught he
should have an immediate trial at this
term court.
Almost of immediately after the find-
| ing of the dead body of the young
girl bloodhounds were secured and they
took the trail, but before they had
gone a great distance a rain Ð·et in,
and the dogs could not follow the
trail further. Posses, however, were
organized and a search was begun in
all directions in an effort to locate the
murderer.
While there is no absolute proof as
to the identity of the murderer there
is some suspicion but no names have
Information from Win-

ston county is to the effect that the
county has never before been so stirred
as it is at this time, and while the
belief at first obtained that if the murderer
was caught he would be given a
short shift, yet it is now thought that
Judge McLean's promise of an immediate
trial at this term of court may
prevent mob violence.
Great sorrow is expressed for the
parents who have been called upon to
suffer the loss of their daughter at
the hands of some fiend whose identity
has not yet been disclosed. A report
has it that the young lady was assaulted
before she met her death, but
this has not been confirmed.
It was impossible to get further particulars
over the telephone at a late
hour tonight, as it was stated that the
line was not working.

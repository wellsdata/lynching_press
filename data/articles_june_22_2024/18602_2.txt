After the Lynchers.
DANVILLE, Ill., May 27.- Saturday's
lynching is still the absrobing topic
of conversation here. There is a
possibility that the members of
the mob who are known will be
indicted by the grand jury. State's
Attorney S. G. Wilson is much opposed
to lynch law, and has taken a more
decided stand in censuring the mob
than any other prominent citizen in
Danville. He said Saturday:" If the
grand jury indicts the lynchers you
can rest assured I will prosecute
vigorously." them

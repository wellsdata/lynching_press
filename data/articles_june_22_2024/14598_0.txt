WORK OF A MOB.
John Peterson, a Negro, Lynched
at Denmark, S. C.
He Was Charged with Criminally Assaulting
a Little Girl- Strong Evidence
That He Was Innocent
of the Crime.
RIDDLED WITH SHOT.
COLUMBIA, S. C., April 25.- The excitement
of the populace at the little vil-
dilage of Denmark, this state, over the
assault upon Bessie Baxter, a 15- year-

the representatives of the press and
about ten citizens were allowed to attend
, two of the number being colored

son was handcuffed. He displayed

an innocent man. He told a
straight story and looked fearlessly
at his questioners. When carried
before Miss Baxter she stated that he
was not the man. A colored woman
swore that Peterson had been in Den-
mar on the morning of the assault.
The court adjourned without getting
any tangible evidence against Peterson,
the odds being greatly in his favor.
But the crowd was so frenzied that it
could not be restrained, and Monday
night Peterson was hanged to tree
and his body filled with bullets a

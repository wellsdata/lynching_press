WELL, WE HOPE IT WON'T
BE TOO HOT IN HELL, ANYWAY
Walhalla, S. C., S. C.
-When, and if, it ever gets cooler in South Carolina, seren-, and if, it ever gets cooler in South Carolina, seren
teen white men charged with the lynching on April 24 of Allen Green, will
probably be weighed in the balance of the blind goddess of justice, as blind as
she can be in South Carolina...But as long as it remains sultry and unpleasant,
judges prosecutors, jurors, and the 17 men accused of mob-murdering Green,
who was arrested for "attempting to attack" an 18-year-old white girl, just
won't be inconvenienced.
Judge M. L. Bonham has granted a motion of defense counsel for contin-
uance until next fall because of the "excessive heat," "until some time when
the weather is cooler.". As soon as the judgment was rendered Solicitor Leon
W. Brasfield, representing the State against the prisoners, snatched his hat and
rushed to a meeting where he spoke for his election to the United States Senat√©
in opposition to Senator Cole Blease.
The eyes of the entire state are focused upon this case due to the fact
that among those indicted are Mayor Robert Lee Ballinger and policeman Alvin
Jones, who have been positively Identified as members of the mob which lynched
Allen Green April 24, when he was accused of attacking a white woman.

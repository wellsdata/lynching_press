After hearing the confession the committee
decided that the negro should
be hanged from a telegraph pole in
the street. Clark said he deserved
death, but asked that the execution be
delayed until yesterday so that he
I could have a farewell interview with
his mother and brother who lived in
Memphis. The request was granted,
and the two relatives were telegraphed
for. Meanwhile the news of the ne
gro's arrest and confession spread rap
idly over the surrounding country, and
yesterday's incoming trains brought
hundreds of people into the city to
witness the lynching.
Roasted the Brute.
The crowds became so great that at
midday the main street of the town
was ordered cleared, and the announcement
was made that it had been decided
to burn Clark at 3:30 p. m. This
statement caused much excitement,
and surging crowds of people began
to gather about the place selected for
the enactment of the awful tragedy.

pieces of wood were carefully laid
about an iron rod which was driven
deep into the ground, and half an hour
later it was announced that all was

At 3 o'clock the prisoner, heavily
manacled was taken from the jail by
,
a posse of armed men, and followed
by a large and excited crowd of men
and boys was led to the east gate of
the negro cemetery, which is situated
in the western part of the city. Faggots
and wood had been piled high
around the stake, and the negro was
securely fastened to the iron rod. Clark
was asked if he cared to make a
statement. He again said that he de
served the fate prepared for him, and
asked that a letter be delivered to his
mother and brother. He appealed to
his brother to raise his children prop
admonishing them beware
erly to of
,
evil company. Finally all was in
readiness and the word was given to
fire the funeral pile.
Victim's Relatives Apply Torch
The husband and brother of Clark's
victim stepped forward and applied
torches, and in a moment the flames
leaped upward, enveloping the trembling
negro in smoke and fire. The
clothing of the doomed man was soon
ignited, and as the flames grew hotter
the skin began to parch. The negro
moaned piteously at this juncture,
and the agonized look upon his face
told of the awful torture he was undergoing
. Finally his head fell forward
upon his breast, and in a few
minutes all was over. The flames were
fed by the crowd until the body was
burned to a crisp. Then the mob dispersed
and the town soon assumed
normal condition. its

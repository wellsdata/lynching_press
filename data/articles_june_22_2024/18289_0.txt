A mob which tried to lynch a man in a little
village in New- Jersey was led by a mother of
nine children, who is a prominent member of
a local church. Fortunately, the effort to hang
the man was unsuccessful. Our sister State
ought either to raise a monument to this mill
tant matron, who boasts of what she has done
and declares she will try it over again, or put
her in prison, where she belongs, for
defiance and violation of law. outrageous

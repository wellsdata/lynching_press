Williamsport, N. D.
Three Indians Are Lynched at
Bismarck, N. D., Nov. 15.- Alex
Coudot, Indian half breed, Paul Holy-
track and Philip Ireland, full blooded
Indians, the first of whom was sentenced
to death for the murder of six members
of the Spicer family last February, and
has just been granted a new trial by the
supreme court, and the latter two self-
confessed accessories in the murder,
were taken from the county jail in Em-
mons county Saturday night and
lynched by a mob. The lynching had
been apparently coolly planned and was
carried out without a break in the pro-
gramme and sudden and swift retribution
was meted out by the mob to the
murderers, Williamsport, where the
hanging took place, is about 40 miles
from this city and off the railroad. The
news of the hanging was received here
Sunday afternoon, when a mounted
messenger arrived, his horse in a foam
from a swift ride, and announced that
the three men had been lynched. The
sheriff of the county, Peter Shier, was
in this city at the time the hanging occurred
and was to him that the messenger
rode it in such hot pace.

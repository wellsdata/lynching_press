A MISSISSIPPI MOB
Hanged Jerry Bell, a Colored Man, to
a Railroad Bridge.
New Orleans, La., March 20.- A special
to the Picayune from Terry, Miss.,
says:" Jerry Bell, a negro, was
lynched tonight by a mob that hanged
him to a railroad bridge. Bell was discovered
at 4 o'clock this morning in the
room of a young woman visiting the
family of R. C. Terry. He escaped to
Bryan, Miss., where he was arrested.
After being brought back to Terry he
was arraigned and bound over to the
circuit court. The officers intended to
take the negro to Jackson tomorrow
for safe keeping, but the mob took
him at 9 oclock tonight.
" Later developments implicate another
negro, Charles Hollingsworth.
whom the mob meant to hang at the
same time and place with Bell. He
fought his way through the small army
of men and, although fifty shots were
fired at him, he escaped in the darkness
. It is generally thought he will
be found in the morning riddled
bullets." with

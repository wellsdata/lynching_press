THE CONSTABLES' DERELICTION.- The Middle
town Whitlocke, involved in the homicide of a
colored man some weeks ago, are still at large.
Coroner Groves has communicated the facts of
the constables' failure to arrest them to the Attorney
- General, and the latter states, in reply,
that he proposes to have all those indicted at
the coming session of Court who have failed to
execute the Coroner's warrant. Constable Ford,
of Pencader, is one of those complained of, haying
had a warraut in his hands for two weeks,
without making an arrest.
It proves to be true that a younger son applied
to Coroner Groves for the warrant to arrest
his father and brother but was refused. It
is proper to state that he took this action in
order that he might obtain the reward
offered and apply the sum to the feeing of
an attorney to defend them in the courts. It is
said that both the Whitlocks are willing to surrender
to the son, if he was deputized to arrest
them. Some people are so uncharitable as to
think that if the case had been reversed and a
white man killed, the negro would not only have
been arrested on the spot but that he would
been tried by lynch law. have

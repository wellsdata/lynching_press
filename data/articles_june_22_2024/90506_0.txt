MOB SLAYS FIVE MEN.
Shooting of a Goat Brings On a Feries
of Tragedies.
The probable fatal shooting of Dr.
Hodges, a leading physician and county
coroner, by James Difatto at Tallulah,
La., resulted a few hours later in the
lynching of Difatto, his brothers, Charles
and Frank, S. Feducio and John Cerano
by a mob of citizens and country people.

complications. It is believed

the affair. The Difatto brothers
were taken from the jail and hanged in
nearby slaughter pen from the gallows
used for killing hogs. Cerano and Fe-
duelo were taken in custody after offering
desperate resistance to the mob at their
store, then led to the jail yard and
injected to the fate of their companions sub-.

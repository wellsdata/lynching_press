weapons charge is quite ridiculous,
for the guns were all seized with-
out search warrants in homes.
There is no law in Tennessee for-
bidding arms being kept in a pri-
vate home.
Clark Promises Probe
In Washington Attorney Gen-
eral Tom Clark has promised if
any federal violations are uncov-
ered, prosecution will follow.
In New York City, Walter
White stated that every pressure
would be brought to bear to se-
cure the arrest and conviction of
the real culprits, the mob members
who stoned the jail February 26,
and the state highway patrolmen
and militiamen who violated the
constitutional rights of citizens. He
said that there was indication that
patrolmen, and militia members
had stolen property. This asser-
tion was based on the fact that at
the time when all civilians were
barred from the Negro area, the
business establishment of Julius
Blair, which had no persons in it,
had the clock shot from the wall,
the juke box wrecked, cloth cut
from the billiard tables, all
cigarettes and cigars missing, as
well as all ice cream.
Thurgood Marshall, chief coun-
sel for the NAACP, will go to
Tennessee to arrange for the de-
fense after he has finished with a
Supreme Court case here, it was
disclosed.
Fear Whitewash
In Columbia Riot

Defendants On
Habeas Corpus Writ
COLUMBIA,
Tenn. — Of-
ficials here this week con-
tinued to build an elaborate
whitewash of the recent po-
lice terror wave imposed on
Negro citizens after they had op-
posed the lynching of a Negro
naval vet and his mother.
A consistent effort is being
made to keep the spotlight on the
Negro "defendants" arrested after
the disturbances rather than on
the practically destroyed and loot-
ed Mink Slide Negro business dis-
trict and the killing by police of
1wo Negroes in an alleged "jail-
break." Authorities are also try-
ing to keep in the background the
fact that only two white arrests
have been made in the case.
William H. Hastie, chairman of
the legal committee of the Na-
tional Association for the Advance-
ment of Colored People, and Mar-
tin Pepper. of the National Law-
yers' Guild, conferred with. Atty.
Gen. Tom Clark in Washington
last week, to insist on a more
vigorous investigation by the De-
partment of Justice. Since U. S.
Attorney Horace Frierson, located
in Nashville, is a native of Colum-
bia, the NAACP requested an in-
vestigator direct from Washing-
ton. However, the department
sent James Ruffin, an assistant at-
torney general and a native of
Tennessee, who promptly an-
nounced he would work under
Frierson's directions.
Beast of Phone-Tapping
Walter White, NAACP executive
secretary, revealed that Bayard
Tarpley, secretary to Governor Mr-
Cord. and Governor McCord him-
self, boasted of tapping the tele-
phone wires on all calls to and
from the Negro district of Colum-
bia.
While categorically denied the
report carried in some newspapers
and over some radio stations that
he had approved of the manner in
which the state and local authori-
ties had handled the riot.
Further efforts to hold 13 Ne-
pro prisoners incommunicado
proved unsuccessful when Maurice
Weaver, white NAACP attorney
and Z. Alexander Looby, Negro at-
torney from Nashville, proceeded
to file habeas corpus writs on be-
half of the imprisoned men.
Just before a hearing on the
habeas corpus writs was to be
held before Circuit Court Justice
Joe M. Ingram, District Atty. Paul
Bumpus, seeing the uselessness of
attempting further secrecy. hand-
ed over a list of the "defendants."

tempt to commit murder charges

Tommy Lee Baxter. Clarence W.

Thomas Edwards, Huston Edwards,

There is no legal basis for the
charges, spokesmen for the “de-
fendants" said. They characterized

exposes the framed-up nature of the
arrest of young Nash., Undeterred
by this lack of identification, the
pusse took Nash into the woods and
strung him up from a tree, after first
attempting to burn him at the stake
but finding the wood and brush too
wet to accommodate that form of
lingering death and torture.
The lynching was carried out ex-
clusively by the posse, which nuni-
bered some 40 local white business
men and landowners. In the first re-
Ports of the lynching the attempt
was made to give the crime a "pop-
ular character" with the deliberate
lie that 500 persons took part in the
lynching.
Second Lynching
The second ly.ching in the same:
day occurred at Aiken, S. C., where
George Jeter was heaten to death by
a gang of four white inen, who ac-
cused him of "stealing liquor from
tl:em.' Before he died Jeter identi-
fied the following men as his mur-
derers: Stamp Floys, Jim Hancock.
Jim Patterson and W. M. Hitt, The
local authorities have made the ges-
ture of ar: sting the four men "pend-
ing an inquest." but hardly anyone
in Aiken is so naive as to expect the
courts of the white ruling class to
convict them.Lynchers

proclaimed his innocence after being
shot five times before the final volley
of bullets took his life. When Nash
asked could he pray he was told to
open his mouth and stick out his
tongue. Doing this an auto plier
clinched his tongue and it was sev-

Never Identified
The banker. J..P. Batchelor, was

him to the Ringgold bank, where he
attempted to effect entrance to the
safe. Batchelor refused to open the
safe, and in the struggle which fol-

burglar wore .no mask, and Mrs.
Batchelor had had full opportunity
to study his face. She refused to

the sheriff brought him before her.

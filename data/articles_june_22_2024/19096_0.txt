BURNED BY FRENZIED MOB.
Thrust Into Fire.
Half Dead Negro, Saturated With Oil,
Belleville, Ill., June 8.-W. T. Wyatt,
a negro school teacher, was lynched
here for shooting and mortally wounding
County Superintendent Charles
Hertel of St. Clair county. Hertel had
refused to renew the teaching certificate
Wyatt, and the negro came into
his office of and attacked him.
Wyatt was immediately arrested and
taken to jail. Two hours later a mob
stormed the jail, secured the negro
and despite the appeals of the mayor
and other officials he was hanged.
Hertel was removed to the hospital,
here the physicians probed for the
bullet, but he stated there is no hope
for his recovery. A young man named
Fielder was in the office during the
shooting. He grappled with Wyatt,
but the negro beat him off with the
butt of his revolver inflicting a severe
,
wound. Before he was hanged Wyatt
the shooting was the result
asserted of a political grudge.
The mob hanged Wyatt to a telephone
pole in the public square. Even
while his body was in the throes of
strangulation, members of the mob be
gan building a fire at the foot of the
pole. The flames flared up and licked
at the feet of the victim, but this did
not satisfy the mob, and another and
larger fire was started. When it had
been burning briskly the negro, still
half alive, was cut down and after be
ng covered with coal oil he was thrust
into the fire. Moans of pain were
heard from the half dead victim of
the mob, and these served to further
infuriate his tortures. They fell upon
aim with clubs and knives and cut
and beat the burning body almost to
pieces, and not until every sign of life
had departed did they desist and permit
the flames to devour the body. As
the fire lighted up the scene the mem-
bers of the mob stood around the fire
fagots into the flames and denouncing
hurling the negro 1or the shooting.

Negress Taken From Jail
MONROE, La., July 25.- Unidentified
men broke into the city jail here early
today and carried off Laura Porter, a
negro woman prisoner, keeper of a
resort where white men are reported
to have been robbed on several occasions
. It is generally believed she was
thrown into the Ouachita river and
drowned. The Porter woman had been
warned to leave town many times prior
to her recent arrest for larceny. Officers
declared they had unearthed a
conspiracy which showed that the
woman had lured intoxicated white
men to her, where they were
beaten and robbed resort by negroes.

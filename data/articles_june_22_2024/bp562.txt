Stern Criticism From Outside
Throughout the country stern crit-
icism is pouring in from a varied
number of sources. The Interna-
tional Labor Defense has sent a re-
quest to the governo: for an immedi-
ate investigation of the crime. Ber-
nard Ades, counsel for the 1. L. D.,
holds Governor Ritchie indirectly rel
sponsible for the lynching. Ades
charges that Ritchie has maintained
that law and order prevail on the
Eastern Shore when the situation IS
otherwise. In a telegram to Gover-
nor Ritchie, the National Association
for the Advancement of Celored Peo-
ple, also registered a protest.
After reviaw
the cumstances
of the lynching, the telegram said:
"In the sum newspaper carrying
an account of this latest fynching in
your state is a dispatch queting a
speech of yours in which you appeal
for full faith in American Institutions
and in th American idea of democ-
racy. We appeal to you not only as
governor of Maryland, but as a lead-
ing exponent of the American sys-
tem, to practice what you preach."
Rabbi Edward L. Israel of the Har.
Sinai Congregation in Baltimore is
sued a statement from his sick bed

rampant on the Eastern Shore boti
at Salisbry and at Snow Hill, where
Yuel Lec, now charged with murder
of a white family, was nearly lynched

the general tone of the papers in the
locality of the recent mob violence
manifestations is the following ex-
cerpt from the Salisbury Times:
"The slaying of Mr. Elliott was de-
plorable, ss W also th: mob scene.
"Every person living on the East-
ern Shore, realizing he hackground.
should use his best judgment and
pay little heed to the overdrawn pic-
tures that will be painted by metro-
pollian newspapers, who have no ob-
ligation to this peninsula and whose
only purpose is that of preparing
news as to increase th own circu-
lations. It becomes a contest among
the larger papers to see which one
can bring out new excitable features
of such a story.
"This paper is a part of the East-
ern Shore, and always tries to serve
the best interests of the peninsula.
We at all times, depiore violence,
either of an individual or a congre-
gation of individuals, but when vio-
lence is done it behooves every-
one of us to co-operate in speeding
up a return to absolutely normal and
harmonious pditions."

Similarity surrounding the crime
and the aliezed confessions in the
case of Yuci Lee and that of Wil-
liams have been noted. Both Lee
and William. vere of low mentality.
Both were unquestionably intimidated
into making a confession; and. In
Church Bible Class, to object to out-
side interference, which the white
minister stated to be the cause of
lynching.
White Press Comments
While such papers as the Phliadel-
pha Record were quick to point out
that such attemps of private indi-
viduals to set themselves up as a
tribunal in place of courts of justice.

was subversire of American ideals,
local Eastern Shore papers were
maintaining a defensive attitude to-
both cases impartial investigators en-
tertain grave doubts as to the guilt
of the accused men. Even if Wil-
lianis had been guilty of the crime.
there was little likelihood that he
would have escaped swift punish-
ment. As well the true fects of his
relationship to his employer, the mur-
dered man, reveal that Williams had
worked for the white man for seven
or eight years a salary of from
six to eleven dollars a week. In both
instances, investigation seems to in-
dicate that the lynching of Williams
and the mob violence stirring up
against Lee were simply subterfuges
used to hide a white murderer.

ANOTHER LYNGHING
IN SOUTH CAROLINA
Negro Hanged to a Limb and Riddled
With Bullets.
Columbus, S. C., Aug. 23.-Wm.
Spain, a negro 21 years of age, was
shot to death by a mob near St.
George, Dorchester county, this afternoon
, the third
lynching in South
Carolina within ten days. S. L. Con-
nor, manager of the Dorchester lumber
company's store at Badham, was
notified by a negro that he saw another
negro attempting to enter a window
of his home and then run away
into a nearby cane patch.
Connor immediately started for his
home, going through the cane field.
and suddenly came upon Spain and
grappled with the negro, striking him
a severe blow, breaking several bones
in his hands. The negro finally freed
himself and ran into the nearby woods.
O Connor notified his neighbors and
about two hours later Spain was captured
and locked up in jail. Shortly
afterward a posse of forty or fifty men
went to the sheriff and securing the
keys of the jail, took the negro to the
house of Connor, where his 11- year- ol√°
daughter positively identified the
the one who had tried
negro as to
climb through the window.
The mob then took the negro to a
nearby oak tree, strung him up to a
limb and fired about 500 shots into his
body

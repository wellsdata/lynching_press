quieted the fusilade and arrested the parties.
Shortly after the shooting an indignation
meeting was held in front of the Sumter House,
at which Mayor Linde and Major Latta made
speeches, deploring the lawlessness and shedding
of innocent blood upon our streets. Our people
feel greatly outraged, and there is strong talk of
lynching. Billie Flynn, Hargrave and Hall are
still alive, but not expected to recover. Drs.
Jones and Neely, who, with other physicians, are
looking after the wounded, think that Billie
Flynn, Hall and Hargrave will die. Doran went
to New Orleans some weeks since, but returned
to this city some two weeks ago, and, with his
party, has been residing in the River Cottage, a
vacant house on Whittington avenue. S. R.
Doran and party, D. R. Prewitt, Dan Prewitt,
Allison and Howell, are in jail. Hall has just
died. now

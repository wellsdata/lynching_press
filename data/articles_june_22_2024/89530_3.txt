The scheme of
neutrality proposed by England stipulates that,
in the event of war, the Congo and Niger, with
their affluents, and the littoral for one maritime
league from the mouths of these rivers, shall
remain free to merchant ships, except such as
are laden with munitions of war, and merchants
of all nation who have depots on the Congo and
Niger are forbidden to supply war vessels with
coal, except in sufficient quantities to reach the
nearest port. The scheme proposed by France
is similar to this, but does not mention the subject
of supplying war vessels with coal in time of
war.
The committee of the conference has accepted
England's proposals regarding the Niger, with
out reservation, but subject to the sanction of
the conference itself. This sanction is regarded
as certain to be given. England's position on
the Niger is left altogether unchanged.
The Congo committee to- day discussed the details
of the navigation statutes to be applied to
the Congo and Niger rivers. The committee approved
the clauses giving private parties the
right of appeal against actions and decisions of
the international commission, through their
respective consuls. United States Minister Kas
son's proposals will be debated tomorrow
neutrality.

Bryanite Loader Arrested
for Old
Murder.
LOUISVILLE, Ky., Nov. 8.- A dying negro in
Metcalfe county last week confessed to being
one of a mob that committed a murder seven
years ago. The leader of the mob, he said, was
Theodore McIntyre, a young Populist politician,
who had moved to Hardyville, Hart county, and
had settled on a farm. McIntyre took a very
active part in the recent campaign for Bryan.
He is the nephew of Silas Payton, one of the
best- known Populists of the State. He was
promptly arrested, taken Edmonton, and
held to answer for murder. to

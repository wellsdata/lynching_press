women put to death by the most
barbarous methods conceivable by|
flendish minds, in order to appease
the dastardly appetites of a “superior":
race. Sixteen dark skinned Ameri-
Cans riddled with bullets and burned
at the stake.

ica and the Christian Church look on
in gentle approval and say, "Too bad."
And Negroes-well they are too in-| he
different to do anything about it.
They sing and dance and sweet mer- CO
riment make while their brothers
hang from telegraph poles. One of
these days a mob is going to lynch
one of their loved ones then they
will expect the rest of the world to
turn out to render assistance.

Peculiar people-Negroes.
America is branded with its lynch
record. It hangs around the neck of
this nation emblazoned In letters of
fro so that all who will may read
and understand that when it comes A
at
the
to lynching America leads the world. 1
The civllized world. stares
Thastly details and asks questions.
Is this the America of the Liberty
Bell and the Statue of Liberty? Is
this the nation that fought to make
the world free for democracy? Is
this the country that proclaims that
all men are created equal? Is this
the America that desires to lead thej
world toward peace and brotherly
love? If it is, then, God deliver us
from such leaderslilp."
Inter-racial committees and Chris- 2
tlan ministers are yelping about only
sixteen lynched in 1925. Why in
Heaven's name is there any cause for
rejoicing so long as the scent of
burning flesh chokes the conscience
(?) of an entire nation? So long as
one human being is offered up as a
burnt offering to satisfy the hellish
lust of mobs America must stand
udged before the world as a pitiable
bypocrite without suficient strength
to enforce law and order.

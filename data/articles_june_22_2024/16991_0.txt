1835, August 1." Beauties of Slavery.- When a
mob burnt down the Charleston Convent, they told
the South it
at was all owing to free
us suffrage
,
and our not having slaves; and Gov. McDuffie said,
in his message, that there could be no freedom without
slavery. The southern papers have never ceased
to taunt us with our lawless mobs, and tell our
aristocracy that they have no refuge from anarchy
but in monarchy. The tables are now turned.
Mobs of the most herrid and bloody kind are now
prevailing at the South, the very offspring of the
elavery without which, Governor McDuffie tells
us, there can be no liberty. Our mobs never end
in bloodshed. The mobs at the South always take
life. The recent scene at Vicksburg has never
been exceeded in outrage upon law since the mob
at Edinburgh hanged Captain Porteus We sub-
.
join a sample of what mobs at the South are doing
Their majesties decree that all the itinerant preach-.
ers, doctors, clock- pedlars, and gamblers, are instigators
of slave insurrections, and if they can flog
a negro into naming any white man, he is seized
and hung by the mob. The next thing will be,
that every citizen of a free State, found south of the
Potomac, will be hung by Lynch's law. Governor
McDuffie will please excuse us from his notions
a free government." of

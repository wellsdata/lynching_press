HAWAIIAN BANDMAN
COMMITS MURDER
James Brown, a member of the defunct
Royal Hawaiian Band, lately

, Missouri. After the band came
to grief, through the desertion of its
leader, on the American tour it was
making in 1893, Brown married a ne-
gress and settled down in Missouri.
Her daughter of fourteen years was
the victim of his crime, which he confessed
after being apprehended. The
had to protect him from
authorities threatened lynching by the negroes.

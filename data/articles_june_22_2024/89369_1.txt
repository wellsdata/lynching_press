In a family feud fight last night at

the stomach and in the abdomen.
The story of the shooting is that the
Crane family, composed of T. B. Crane,
the father; Will Crane, Walter Crane
and two other sons whose names could
not be learned, were after a young man
named Luther Ragsland. What the
trouble was between Ragsland and the
Crane boys could not be ascertained last
night. Both parties were heavily armed
and were intent on shooting each other.
Ragsland was so greatly outnumbered by
the Crane family, however, that he was
afraid to meet them.
The Crane boys and their father located
Ragsland and a chase through the mining
camp followed. Ragsland could not
get away it appears and ran into the
house of his neighbor, Mr. Wynn, who is
one of the best men and most highly respected
miners of the neighborhood.
The Cranes demanded that Mr. Wynn
should deliver up Ragsland.
The Cranes surrounded the house and
demanded that Ragsland should be delivered
into their hands or they would
fire into the windows. Mr. Wynn refused
still to surrender Ragsland and
door he went outsi to reopening
the
monstrate with the Cranes and attempt
to persuade them to leave. When Mr.
Wynn appeared in the doorway, it is alleged
, the Cranes opened fire upon him
and shot him down. They then fled and
up until 2 o'clock this morning had not
been captured.
The shooting was reported to the sheriff's
office and the three deputies were
rushed to Warrior in an automobile. The
shooting occurred about 9:30 o'clock.
Armed posses of both negroes and white
men are scouring the woods and fields
about Laco mines in search of the five
Cranes. The deputy sheriffs have charge
of the manhunt but feeling is running
high on account of the shooting and a
lynching is said to be imminent in case
the men are found soon.
Dogs will be sent to Warrior this morn-
in the case the Cranes are not captured
during the night.

of our race, forward and upward?
With the Jim Crow Cars north of
Washington, with lynching and burnings
, slavery called peonage, staring
us in the face, you answer:" I cannot,
I cannot." Why then do these same
people idolize Mr. Washington? Because
he is the instrument in their
hands to rob us of our rights and liberties

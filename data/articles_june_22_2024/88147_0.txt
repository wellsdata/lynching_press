Manhattan, Kan., Oct. 21.- A crowd of
excited citizens thronged the streets here
last night in the vicinity of the county
Jail, threatening summary vengeance
upon the murderer of Sheriff S. B. LÃ¦rd,
who was shot down yesterday while in
the performance of official duties at
Leonardville, a village twenty miles
northwest of Manhattan. The murderer
whose death is demanded by the clamorous
mob is Ike Warren, a notorious
" bootlegger" of Leonardville. Sheriff
Lard and a deputy arrested Warren
at Leonardville yesterday afternoon upon
warrants sworn out by some of the
prohibition people of the place, and
when the killing occurred were on the
way with him to the railway station.
The deputy, who is said to have been
drinking, carried two revolvers, one of
which he carelessly exposed within
reach of the prisoner.
Banker Makes a Good Shot,
Warren, who was drunk, grabbed one
of the weapons and turned it upon
Sheriff Lard. He fired one bullet into
the sheriff's head, and as the officer
fell a second bullet took effect in the
body near the heart. Warren, breaking
loose from his remaining captor, then
dashed down the street. His flight was
stopped by Banker Sparks, of Leonard-
ville, who having seen the shooting of
the sheriff drew a revolver and began
shooting at Warren. A bullet which
took effect in the neck brought the murderer
to a standstill. The shooting
caused great excitement at Leon-
ardville
, and the murderer might
have
been roughly handled but
for the fact that two deputy sheriffs
hurried off with him to the station, and
soon had him aboard the train bound
for Manhattan.
Well Done, Deputy Sheriff's!
Sheriff Lard died within a few minutes
, and the news of the murder was
telegraphed here. When the train bear-
ing the murderer arrived here at 8:30
o'clock a crowd of 600 men surrounded
the station. The cry of" lynch him"
was immediately heard, and the crowd
gathered in upon the prisoner. The six
deputy sheriffs who had Warren in custody
drew their revolvers and threatened
to shoot the first man who made a
hostile move. The murderer, who was
shaking with fright, was drawn to an
omnibus, the six deputies jumped in, the
horses were lashed into a run, and the
reins were not drawn until the county
jail was reached. The mob followed and
soon surrounded the county jail, demanding
the life of the murderer. A
little girl came into the crowd carrying
a flour sack containing thirty fect of
rope. She would not say who had sent
her.
May Be a Lynching Yet.
The crowd became still more demonstrative
, and finally Deputy Sheriff
Marsh came to the jail steps and urged
the citizens to allow the law to take its
course. He told them that the murderer
had been shot in the neck and was
badly hurt, and urged the crowd not to
attempt the life of a man who might die
of his wounds. This seemed to quiet the
crowd for a time, but it soon became
known that Warren was not badly hurt,
and the talk of a lynching became more
pronounced. At 11 o'clock last night the
town was quieter, but it was reported
that several secret meetings were being
held with the intention of
Ing for a lynching. organiz-

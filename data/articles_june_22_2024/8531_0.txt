A GHASTLY SPECTACLE.
The Rape Fiend Foster,, is Lynched Near
Longview.
Special to the Gazette.
LONGVIEW, TEX, June 8.- Late yesterday
evening the pursuing party came
the rape fiend, Foster, alias Tal
Degar upon, at Lansing Switch, six miles east
of here on the Texas and Pacific, near
the Harrison and Gregg county lines.
He was sitting resting on the railroad
with Colonel McMillan's gun across his
lap and was surprised suddenly by four
men, who came up silently from the rear.
Negroes living near by saw him disarmed
and taken to a skirt of the woods near by
but was afraid to go there. They ventured
there this morning at 8 o'clock and
found him hanging to a tree. Other ne-
groes visited the place at noon and found
him still hanging there, presenting a horrible
spectacle indeed, bloated and covered
with green flies. The ravisher has
met his just dues at last, and up to this
writing is still han.ing, as no officers
been notified and no one seems disposed
have to touch his vile body.

In the multitude of talk that accom-
panies the visit of a President, much
that would ordinarily receive special attention
is overlooked or scantily noted.
The presence of Mr. Roosevelt and his
entertainment was no exception to the
rule, and long after will be remembered
things that should have been" featured",
to speak. In especial sense is this the
so case of the remarks of the President at
Tuskegee concerning the work of Thomas
G. Jones, judge of the United States court
for the middle and northern districts of
Alabama.
By special invitation Judge Jones was a
member of the President's party from
Montgomery out to Tuskegee and back,
and sat near him while he made both
speeches. He had been talking of the
obligation of the white men of the south
to help the negro in every way to secure
his rights whatever they may be. Turning
to Judge Jones he said:
" I want to tell you people that the
negro owes a great obligation, an obligation
he can never pay, to Judge Jones for
courage, his inflexible stand
his inflexible
for righteousness in assuring to all men
their justice and their rights. And as
great a debt as the negro owes him the
white man owes him a still greater obligation
. Judge Jones you have been a
potent factor in the upbuilding of righteousness
and justice to all men. It pleases
me to be able to tell you this."
This reference is without doubt to the
action of Judge Jones in calling upon a
United States grand jury to indict members
of the mob which lynched Horace
over a
at Huntsville something
year Mapels ago.

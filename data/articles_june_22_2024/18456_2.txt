There was great excitement and the old
ill feeling of the people of this section St.
showed itself. A mob of about two hun- in
dred women quickly gathered and surrounded
the car, shrieking at the motor
man and conductor and threatening to
lynch them. The conductor sought safe
ing
ty in flight, but the motorman was
hemmed in and drew a revolver, with
which he kept the angry women at bay and
until the police arrived and rescued him.
Both were later placed under arrest.
Many children were bruised, but none of in
them aside from Anna Talzier, is dangerously
, hurt.

Our public schools,
equipped with capable teachers

Continuing, the editor said: "In
Florida a few months ago, a Negro
under indictment for attempted
rape was snatched from jail by a
mob and shot to death. Gov. Mil-
lard Caldwell of Florida said he
didn't consider this a lynching.
He went on to opine that the mob
had saved courts, etc., considerable
trouble and added:
Governor Quoted
""The ordeal of bringing a young
and innocent victim of rape into
open court and subjecting her to
detailed cross-examination could
easily be as great an injury as
the original crime. This fact prob-
ably accounts for a number of
killings which might otherwise be
avoided.""
In conclusion, Collier's asserted:
"Thus, Cherry of North Carolina
expresses the forward-looking view
of these matters, while Caldwell
of Florida expresses the old, nar-
row view which has been about
as harmful to Southern white peo-
plÄ™ as to Southern Negroes. We
can only congratulate North Caro-
lina on its governor, and hope
that Florida may have similar
gubernatorial good luck before
long."
A strong denial that Governor
Caldwell approved the lynching of
Payne was made to the Defender
Saturday by John Wiggington, the
governor's executive secretary.
Statement Called Unjust
He said that Time Magazine
had accused Caldwell of condon-
ing mob violence in an early Janu-
ary issue but had retracted its
story after complaint of its "in-
justice" in the matter had been
made by the governor.
He charged: "Collier's has taken
up where Time left off. It is try-
ing to put the governor in a bad
light.
"The fact that he had a special
grand Jury convened, sent a spe-
cial investigator from his office,
and rebuked the sheriff of Madi-
son County (where lynching took
place) of dumbness and negligence
of duty in connection with the
lynching, surely proves that he did
not condone the lynching of the
Negro."
Sheriff Not Ousted
When asked by the Defender
why Governor Caldwell did not
remove the sheriff from office for
permitting the mob to get into the
jail at Madison and remove Payne,
Wittington said: "The governor's
position in that regard has been
previously expressed. It was his
opinion that nothing had been dis-
covered to link the sheriff with
the lynching."
The governor's secretary further
"explained": "He (the sheriff) is
just a dumb public servant. But
since the people had elected him
and there was no proof offered
he was involved in the slay

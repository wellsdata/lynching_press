LYNCHING CONDEMNED.
Florida Whites and Blacks Denounce
the Killing of a Preacher.
LAKE CITY, Fla., July 13.- The citizens
of this city and vicinity held an indignation
meeting, last night, over the lynching
of Robert Bennet, a young negro preacher,
who had been taken from his pulpit on the
4th of July by a mob and hanged. The
meeting was well attended by both races.
The following resolutions were adopted:
" Whereas, On the 4th of July unknown
parties from Swanee county invaded our
borders and took from the pulpit Robert
F. Bennett, a well- known citizen of our
county, and, without authority, hanged and
shot him to death, therefore be it
" Resolved, That we, citizens of Columbia
county, stamp such unlawful act as an
unwarranted violation of the law; that we
I have confidence in our courts and citizens
to enforce the laws in all such matters, and
to bring to speedy trial and punishment
any offense against the virtue and chastity
of our women; that lynching is nowhere
justified by law, nor should it be palliated
by good citizens, and we now call on the
Governor of the State and all his officers
to use their best endeavor to stamp out
the growing evil in our midst. We believe
that the punishment provided by law, when
would
visited upon assaulters of women,
have a better effect than lynching."
This is perhaps the first time in the history
of this State that blacks and whites
met together for such a purpose
. Bill."

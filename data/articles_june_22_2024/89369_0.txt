WHITE FARMER DODGES
A LEADERLESS MOB
Newberry, S. C., July 21. While a
mob bent upon lynching Thomas Yar-
borough, a white farmer, was gathering
early this morning near Silver
Street, this county, the intended victim
was spirited away by a deputy sheriff,
placed aboard a train and taken to
the state penitentiary at Columbia for
safe keeping. The lack of a leader is
all that prevented the mob carrying
out its designs before the deputy sheriff
arrived on the scen√©.
Yarborough, who is now living with
his third wife, is accused of having
assault the 7-
attempted to criminally
year- old daughter of a neighboring
farmer. The alleged crime occurred
three weeks ago, but only yesterday
became in the community. Yar-
borobugh known is 45 years old of age.

THE Owensboro Messenger is to be
praised for its enterprise and speed
in the matter of the Holt hanging.
The mob finished hanging Holt at
three o'clock in the morning. At
4:30 the Messenger was being delivered
at the doors of its readers with a
full and detailed account of the
lynching. This is enterprising
nalism in its fullest sense. jour

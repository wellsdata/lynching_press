A PROBABLE LYNCHING.
An Indian Territory Town Wrought Up
Against a Criminal Assailant.
Muskogee, I. T., Dec. 26.- Great excitement
prevails at Stillwell, a small
town near here, over the attempted.
criminal assault of Miss York, a 14-
year- old girl, by Abraham Hughes.
The girl repulsed Hughes, and as she
fled he fired a shotgun at her at close
range. Hughes was arrested and taken
to Vinita to escape mob violence. The
town is considerably wrought up and
lynching may follow.

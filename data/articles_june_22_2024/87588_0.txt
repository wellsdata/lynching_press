Penwis, Superintendent of the Buffalo
State line railroad, was found guilty of kidnapping
, by an Erie jury yesterday. The
charge arose from the late Harbor Creek riot
during the Erie railroad disturbance when
the mob endeavored to lynch Dennis. The
Cars were put in motion to protect him, and a
Harbor Creek man named Cooper, was car-
ried into New York State.

Lawyer Beaten ByMaryland Mob Beaten ByMaryland Mob
SNOW HILL, Md.-(CNS)-
raging mob of lynchers, three tim
thwarted in their attempts to wres
vengeance on Yuel Lee, 60 year d
Negro alleged to have murdered,
white farmer and his family, becau
he had been taken to Baltimore f
safe keeping, last week spent the
fury on Benjamin Ades, above,.
L.D. attorney retained to defend ti
colored man, and his two aides, He
en Mays, a white woman, and Öser
Arabowsky, the lawyer's secretar
The mob attacked the three pe
sons on two occasions Wednesda,
tearing their clothing, beating the
with sticks and brutally pummelir
the white woman. Only half-hearti
protests against the outrage we
inade by deputy sheriffs.
Ades had come here to seek
change of venue on the ground the
Lee would not be given a fair tri:
here. After being twice beaten, thị
trio were taken to jail for safekeep
ing. There they were searched with
out warrants, and a gun was foun
on the woman, who said she had bee
hired by the International Labor De
fense to defend the life of the law
yer.
The woman was arrested on th
charge of carrying a. concealed wea
pon at the instigation of the mayo
of the town and several other lead
ers of the mob. She was released or
$500 bond and all of the group wer
speedily escorted out of town.
Immediate lynching of Lee woul
result if he were ever brought back
to Snow Hill, observers of the situ
ation here say. A change of venue tet
Dorchester County was granted lates
last Friday on the ground that heE
would not get a fair trial here. Lees
was put in the Baltimore city jail
for safekeeping.
The most tragic development of the
day, however, happened later when
the secretary of Liberty League,
Louis Berger, asked Governor Albert
Ritchie to dispatch troops here to
portect the prisoner and his repre-
sentatives. The governor, with ama-
zing objectivity, declined to do so
upon the assurance of the state's
attorney of Worcester County, God-
frey Child, that protection would be
given here.
Thus Maryland exhibits herself in
the 'raw. A confession is allegedly
beaten out of a prisoner. Volun-
teers, officer of the court, who ap-
pear to defend him, to see not that
he is favored, but that the law is
upheld, are beaten and chased out
of town. Protection is requested
from h higher authority, presiden-
tial aspirant, Gov. Ritchie yields to
the assurance of the chief law en-
forcement officer of the county in
which the outrage has occurred, and
declines to give protection.
Mississippi-Maryland,
Not
Governor Albert Ritchie told rep.
resentatives of the press late last
Thursday that he saw no reason why
the should interfere in the matter at
this time. In effect Governor Ritch-
pie danied the right of Ades to ap-
(pear in the case even though selected
by the condemned man.

The Governor declared that Ades
"has not been engaged by anyone in
nuthority to represent Orphan Jones
(Orphan Jones is the man's alias)."
"Of course," the Governor added,
E"this does not justify attacking or
emolesting him, but it is, nevertheless,
a fust."
E
Governor Ritchie takes the posi-
etion in his statement that Mr. Ades
has no reason to return to Snow
Hill as he has announced he will.
Mr. Ades, for his part, said this
week that "Lee signed a retainer
maling me his sole attorney and spe-
cifically stated in the retainer that
ehe did not wish to be represented
by any other counsel."
This retainer has been filed in the
Cijcuit Court for Worcester Coun-
ity in this case and I have a photo-
istitic copy of it at my office."
"Lee has a constitutional right to
select his own counsel and I am still
Lee's attorney. I intend to act as
nch and any violation of Lee's con-
stitutional rights by the judges of
the First Circuit will be promptly
appealed to the Court of Appeals."

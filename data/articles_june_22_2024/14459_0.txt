Will Attack the Jail.
OMAHA, Neb., Oct. 10.- Seven members
of the mob which lynched the negro
rapist last night are under arrest charged
with murder in the first degree. County
Attorney Mahoney refused to allow the
prisoners bail and by 7 p. m., a large
crowd surrounded the jail and threatened
if the prisoners were not given their liberty
the jail would be attacked and the
men liberated. The men under arrest
are Ed. Neuschalfer, Patrick O'Herne,
John Fritz, R. G. Bloom, H. H. Brandies
, Ed. Fitzgerald, and John O'Dono
ghue. County Attorney Mahoney sent
word the men would not be released under
any circumstances and the crowd at
once began to lay plans for attacking the
jail.
When the mob gathered in front of
the jail Jailer Harrigan appeared, announcing
that none of the men wanted
were there and offering to escort a committee
of ten through the building. The
crowd accepted the proposition and the
committee reported the men gone. Five
of the prisoners have been released on
bail and the other two taken to Pappillion.
An Important Decision.
Waco, Tex., Oct. 10.- This morning
District Judge Goodrich held the alien
land law, passed by the last legislature,
unconstitutional and void. The law excluded
foreigners from buying or loaning
money on Texas land and created a
money stringency throughout the state severe.

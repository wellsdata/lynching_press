Afraid of Being Lynched.
Fear of being lynched has sent Clarence
Woodard to the penitentiary, says
Casper special to the Cheyenne Tribune
. He has been sentenced to serve
three years for grand larceny. He is
the younger brother of Charles Wood
ard, the supposed slayer of Sheriff
Ricker, and was one of the four prisoners
who broke jail. He became separated
from his brother shortly after
ward and has not since seen him. Clarence
Woodard and Foote, one of the
other escaped prisoners, were captured
near the scene of the killing. Since
the long chase after his brother,
Charles Woodard been in
progress
he ha been very nervous and listened
to reports that a lynching would
assuredly follow Charles Woodward's
capture with very apparent fright. He
was not certain that, the blood of the
mob once up, he might be lynched
also.
Therefore he agreed to plead guilty
to a charge of grand larceny in order
that he de sentenced and gotten
out of the might country.

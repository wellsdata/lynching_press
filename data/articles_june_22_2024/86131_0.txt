TENNESSEE LYNCHINGS.
More Indictments Found for the Mil-
lington Murderers.
Memphis, Tenn., Sept. 9.- The grand
jury, which had been in session all day
yesterday, at 10:30 o'clock last night returned
six true bills against M. Strick-
faden, Jim Perley and Ed Smith for
murder. They are charged with being
parties to the lynching of the six negroes
at Millington on the night of Aug. 81.
These three had already been arrested
on bench warrants and
their indictment created considerable
excitement. Following the action of the
grand jury, Judge J. G. Cooper issued a
bench warrant for Assistant Jailer Will-
cox on a charge of perjury. Cox, who
was in the ante- room waiting te appear
before the grand jury, was arrested and
jailed. It is reported that the mob which
shot the negroes did not consist of over
ten people. Ten men would not have made
the attack, unless they had had an understanding
with Richardson. The whole
plot will be laid bare, at least, that
what the officers say. is

MARION'S MOB
LYNCHING PUT
BEFORE HOOVER
Negroes Urge Enactment of
Federal Law to Stop
Violence.
The lynching of two Negroes in
Marion, Ind., Aug. 7, has been carried
to the attention of President
Hoover by the Negro Anti- Lynching
congress now in session in Wash-
ington.
The nation's chief executive was
urged to secure the enactment by
congress of legislation to stamp out
lynching in the United States.
The request was made this week
by a delegation of Negroes attending
the congress, headed by Wil-
liam Monroe Trotter, Boston, Mass.,
executive secretary of the National
Equal Rights League and
Race congress.
In a memorial presented to the
President protesting lynchings, the
petitioners asserted that lynchings
in 1930 more than doubled either of
the two preceding years.
" We ask suppression of lynching,"
said the memorial," in the interest
of domestic peace and tranquility.
States do not stop it and seem unable
when willing. Because of the
strength of local prejudice, Texas
veniremen refused to convict and
Indiana county prosecutors were
unable to obtain the necessary
action.
" Victims are being found to have
been innocent, and if these lynchings
increase and the federal government
does not give the necessary
protection, the menaced race, deserted
, may in desperation feel
compelled to protect itself, which
massacres, and civil
means riots,
war worse than the race riots
of Chicago and Washington."
When the Grant county grand
jury refused to indict any of the
Marion mob leaders and exonerated
Sheriff Jacob C. Campbell of all
blame, Attorney- General James M.
Ogden filed affidavits against the
sheriff and seven alleged leaders.
Sheriff Campbell has not been ar-

have entered not guilty pleas and
three are fugitives.

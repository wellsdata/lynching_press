WICHITA FALLS( Tex.), Feb. 26.-
The two men who murdered Cashier
Dorsey of the City National Bank here
yesterday, and then looted the bank,
were captured this morning. To- night
taken from the jail by mob
they a
were
and lynched to a telegraph pole.
At 2:30 this morning the robbers,
Foster Crawford and the Kid, alias
Younger Lewis, were captured by posses
of rangers under command of Captain
W. J. McDonald in a thicket sixteen
miles from Wichita Falls.
When called upon to surrender they
replied:" We will surrender under condition
that you guarantee us protection
against any mob violence."
Captain McDonald's reply was:" We
will bore a hole through you if you do
not surrender, but will endeavor to the
of my ability to protect you."
About forty of the rangers reached
Wichita Falls with the prisoners. When
the town was reached it was found to be
in a state of uproar, many threats were
made, the mob crying:" We will lynch
them; give them a taste of Tyler; that's
what they deserve."
But they finally reached the jail and
landed their prisoners in safety. Shortly
afterwards a crowd of well- armed men
gathered together and repaired to the
jail, where they remained all night discussing
the situation and swearing dire
vengeance on the prisoners.
When daylight came the entire population
of Wichita Falls had assembled
in the yard of the jail, each man bringing
a weapon. Those who could not
boast of a Winchester had some sort of
firearm concealed on their persons
,
judging from the appearance of their
pockets.
At 8:30 J. A. Kemp, President of the
bank, and at least twenty men were
admitted to the jail. Identification was
instantaneous and undoubtful. District
Judge George E. Miller at this
juncture appeared on the streets in a
buggy and drove from group to group
pleading with them to do nothing rash,
and allow the law to take its course.
Presently the report was heard on all
sides that the rangers were going to
ship them off to Fort Worth. In an instant
hundreds of Winchesters
appeared
on the scene, and the mob at
once made an assault on the jail. After
some moments they succeeded in securing
entrance, and, taking the prisoners
from the jail, proceeded with them
to the bank where Dorsey was killed,
where a pile of inflammable material
was ready. Two telegraph poles were
selected and two ropes thrown over
them, in the ends of which loops had
been made, which were placed around
the necks of the men, and the word
given to pull. In an instant the two men
were swinging between earth and sky.
The loud cry of" Riddie them" was
given, and the firing commenced. The
bodies were riddled with bullets and
swinging. left

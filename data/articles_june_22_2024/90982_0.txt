Jailed by Supreme Court.
Washington. For the first time in
American history six men are in prison
for contempt of the Supreme Court of
the United States. For the first time
the federal government has placed
men behind the bars as an outcome
of the lynching of a negro.
At the United States jail here, Capt.
Joseph F. Shipp, former sheriff at
Chattanooga; Jeremiah Gibson, his
jailer, and Luther Williams, Nick No-
lan, Henry Pudgett and William
Mayes of the same city Monday afternoon
began to serve terms of imprisonment
imposed a few hours before by
the Supreme Court of the United
States.
Shipp and Gibson had been found
guilty of failing to protect from a mob
Ed Johnson, whose legal execution for
rape had been stayed by the Supreme
Court, until it could review the case.
The others had been stayed by the
Supreme Court, in the lynching of a
federal prisoner. Shipp, Williams and
Nolan each were sentenced to ninety
days' imprisonment, while Gibson,
and Mayes each received sixty
Padgett days.

NEW YORK CITY, Jan. 18
Mob lynching in Maryland. Mis-
sourl, California. Lynch law in
Alabama!
For the third time Heywood Pat-
terson, and for the second time
Clarence Norris are sentenced to
die in the electric chair.
Both convicted contrary to the
evidence.
Ruby Bates' testimony that they
are innocent was disregarded.
Judge Horton's opinion, reversing
the last jury's verdict as contrary
to the evidence was disregarded.
Judge Horton's opinion, reversing
the last jury's verdict as contrary
to the evidence was disregarded.
Jud Horton was "removed" and
replaced by Judze Callahan.
This judge "forgot" to instruct
the jurors how to bring in a ver-
dict if they found the boys "not
guilty." instructing them only how
to word their verdict of "guilty."
The state's attorney admitted be-
fore the court that his plea to the
jury was "an appeal to passion."
The court was turned into a forum
from which to appeal to the basest
passions of hatred und violence
against black men because they
are black.
The Scottshoro boys stood be-
tween such "justice" and violent
lynching.
Seven of the boys have a short
respite.
Their lives depend upon us.
We must take appeals to the Su-
preme Court of Alabama and
should we fail there-to the Su-
preme Court of the United States.
The printing alone for these
briefs, in the State Supreme Court
will cost $3,500, and they must be
E complete and ready within 30 days
of December 7th. In addition, $1,500
is immediately required for the
court stenographers' fees and other
fees connected with the appeal.
Again we ask all those who feel
outraged by injustice, lynching and
class discrimination to help us in
this struggle for elementary justice.
Will you send us a contribution
quickly?
Do not fail these boys in this
critical moment.

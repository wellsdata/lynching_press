against Negroes awakened shame and
resentment. But since the practice of
lynching has found its way into many
Northern states, the country seems to

be cherished and defended like other
institutions. It is indeed strange
that when the crime for which lynch-
ing was urged as justifiable has decreased
almost to a vanishing point,
disposition to condemn has de
the creased also.

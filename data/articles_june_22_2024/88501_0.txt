fact that the most careful systematic
investigation into the subject of lynching
that has ever been made in this country
, shows that only 35 per cent of those
lynched have been even charged with
violence to women. To attempt to say
that all these 35 per cent were guilty
would be to argue that the judgment
of the mob is more unerring than that of
the court. We cannot and should not escape
the punishment for our sins of commission
, or of omission.

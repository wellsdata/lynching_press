The child so brutally abused by its stepfather
, John Waterside, at Smiley, Ind.,
has died. Waterside is now in jail and his
wife will be as soon as the officers can find
her. The pair took especial delight in
maiming the child, until finally the surgeons
had to amputate one arm and limb
weeks after it should have had medical aid.
For two weeks after the operation was performed
, on August 16, the mother would tie
the little cripple to a bedstead and leave it
there for hours without nourishing,
although the child was screaming with
hunger. Unless Waterside has a
trial there is great danger of lynching speedy.

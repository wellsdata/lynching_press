On Friday night, the jail in Bardstown, Ill.,
was attacked by a mob desirous of lynching
County Clerk Dieffenbacher, confined there for
having killed a man the day previous. The jail
being well guarded, the ruffians were repulsed.
In revenge they set fire to the town, and a
whole block of the best buildings were con
of sumed before the flames could be extinguished.
Further trouble is feared
of.

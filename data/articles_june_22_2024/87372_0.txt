, and is nearly dead for lack of food
and fatigue.
The governcr was immediately notified.
and he ordered out troops. The soldiers
got here ahead of an armed mob, who were
late in learning of the arrest.
By midnight the little jail was surrounded
by troops with loaded guns and more were
constantly arriving. The mob was very
threatening, and had a rope, but early in
the morning had entirely disappeared.
The governor has ordered Williams taken
to Atlanta, and says he will give the$ 250
reward when delivered to him.
The train must pass through Lovejoy.
however, and it is said a mob of lynchers
has formed there to intercept the prisoner.
It will be almost impossible to get him
alive to Atlanta.
Court may convene here in jail at once
to try Williams, and by prompt measures
of that sort may allay the excitement
which now prevails in this and all four
neighboring counties. The mob has not
appeared this morning, but its members
are encamped along the railroad track be
tween Lovejoy and Jonesboro' in the field
in which the assault took place.
Williams is too to eat, and has
spent the night in frightened prayer.

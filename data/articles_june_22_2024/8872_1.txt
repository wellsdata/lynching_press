A BRUTE ARRESTED IN GRAND
FOR CRIMINAL ASSAULT
FORKS ON 5- YEAR- OLD CHILD.
Grand Forks, March 24.- This city is
in a fever of excitement tonight over
the arrest of a man charged with a
horrible crime. The little 5- year- old
daughter of Mrs. Carrie Wells was complaining
of not feeling well and a doctor
was called in when it was discovered
that the little one was suffering
en
with a loathsome disease which upon
inquiry revealed the fact that a man
named Fred Williams had known the
girl for some time. He was placed under
arrest and placed in the county jail.
Later he retained counsel and a hearing
was fixed for next Monday. It is
understood he was to have been married
next week to a young woman residing
in this city. Indignation at
fever heat and lynching is talked is of.

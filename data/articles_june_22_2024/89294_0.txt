HANOVER, N. H., Aug. 21.- Frank
Almy, the farm hand who murdered
Christie Warden the night of July 16,
was located in the haymow of the
barn of Andrew Warden, father of the
murdered girl, Thursday morning.
Almy was well armed and kept his
pursuers at bay for several hours.
Finally a dozen citizens armed
with Winchester rifles entered the
barn, and, after exchanging a mum-
ber of shots with the murderer, overpowered
him and took away his weapons
. A large crowd of excited villagers
had surrounded the barn with the
avowed intention of lynching Almy,
and it was with the greatest difficulty
that his captors fought their way
through the excited mob and carried
their prisoner in safety to the Wheelock
house where he is now lodged, protected
, by a dozen deputy sheriffs.

For the sake of the county of Fauquier, of
the whole State of Virginia, and of the men
ougaged in the lynching of the negro st War-
renton, yesterday, hope the report that the
young woman is the we case is an imbecile is cor-
young woman is the case is an imbecile is cor-
yeat, for otherwise a criminal outrage has been
committed lich demands the speedy arrest
and punishment of all the parties implicated,
and which, even then, will react injuriously
not only upon the county and State in which it
was perpetrated, but upon the whole South.
If the young woman is sane the aegro did not
deserve death, and those who hanged
him are guilty
of a great wrong, Got
only in the eyes of the law, but of all
reasonable people, and those who shield
and protect them are abettors in their crime,
and the county and State in which such an out
rage is permitted to pass with impuity will re-
ceive the condemnation of all law abiding men.
The truth faloess of the report to which we allude
will palliate the offense in no slight degree,
but even in that case it would have been infi-
nitely better to have allowed the law, which had
the culprit in its hands, to have meted out to
him the prescribed punishment. Lynch law is
never attractive, but in a civilized community
taxed to support court houses and jails it is
horribly repulsive, and assumes even a darker
hue at the home of Chief Justice Marshall,
whose portrait adorns the court house in
of which this outrage upon law took place. sight

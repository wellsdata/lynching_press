INDIANA.
Fear of a Conflict with Soldiers Deters a
Mob from Attacking the Decatur Jail.
Special to the Indianapolis Journal.
DECATUR, May 24.- The excitement produced
by the threatened lynching last
night of Lige Holiand and Andrew Pickern
and their wives on account of the abduction
of Miss Daisy Reynolds, the Wilishire
( Ohio) school teacher, continues unabated.
Reliable information reached here to- day
that about one hundred men of Willshire
and vicinity had organized and expected
to reach the city quietly by different roads
and make a raid upon the jail. About 2
o'clock this morning four spies from Will-
shire, who had driven here in the afternoon
, learned that Governor Hovey, on the
application of Sheriff McConnell, of this
county, had ordered the State militia to
guard the jail, and also that the citizens of
the city would give any needed assistance
to resist violence. The spies left here
for Willshire early enough to reach the organized
mob before starting and give information
as to the resistance to be offered,
and the proposed lynching was postponed.
George Updegrapf, the alleged betrayer
of Miss Reynolds, who was arrrested at
Delphos, yesterday, was not put in jail in
his own county, but was taken to Lima,
O., and incarcerated there in order to remove
him from the reach of the mob. The
final trial of the prisoners will not occur
until August, and fears exist here that the
Willshire community may accomplish the
lynching within that time if the jail is not
constantly guarded. Sheriff McConnell expressed
a determination to- day to bave the
prisoners removed to some county jail not
within reach of the threatened.

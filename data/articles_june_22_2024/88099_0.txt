MOB LYNCHES NEGRO.
Cochran, Ga., March 21. Fifty men
covered a posse of deputy sheriffs
with guns near here this afternoon,
seized Homer Bush, a negro, and
strung him up to a telephone pole.
Bush, a prisoner at the convict camp,
one mile from this place, killed a
guard with a shovel and shot at two
others, in an endeavor to escape. The
two guards, unharmed, returned the
fire and Bush fell with a bullet in his
body. Deputy sheriffs were summoned
and while ndeavoring to take the
negro Hawkinsville to be locked
up, met to the mob.

Lastingly Disgraced.
[ Kokomo Dispatch.]
The town of Bedford has been lastingly disgraced
and the good name of the state put to
shame by a lynching bee this morning. The
statement of a correspondent of an Indian-
apolis paper to the effect that the citizens of
and Seymour approve the action of
the Bedford mob makes the affair the more deplorable.

Kentuckians Work So Quietly That
None Knew of Lynching Until
Mob Had Dispersed.
Henderson, Ken., Nov. 28.- Ellis
Buckner, a negro who was arrested
Friday on a charge of detaining pretty
Miss Mary Hardin against her will,
was taken from the jai! early today
and hanged to a tree on the river
front. So quietly did the mob work
that no knew of the lynching until
after one the lynchers had dispersed.

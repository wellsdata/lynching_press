A Mob Get Their Man By Overpowering
Jailer Best, Formerly of
This County.
Thomas Blair was taken out of the jail
at Mt. Sterling at 2 a. m. January 1st by
a a mob and was hung near the town. Last
February Captain J. L. Bomar, a gallant
ex- Federal soldier, was killed by H. C.
Turner, Thomas Blair and John Mc
Kenzie on the streets of Mt. Sterling.
Bomar had charged Turner with debauching
his wife, and had threatened to kill
him on sight.
At the examining trial Turner was acquitted
, and Blair and McKenzie held in
$ 5,000 bonds, but the grand jury failed to
indict and they were discharged. Blair
left, and never returned until a few days
ago. A few hours after he got back, he
shot at a man in a disreputable house
and was jailed.
Opinion is much divided as to the
cause of the mob's action, and many ex
press the opinion that it was not the
friends of Bomar who did the hanging.
The Jailer, James Best, formerly of
this county, was overpowered by
mob, who then took the keys. the

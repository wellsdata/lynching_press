HANGING IN STORE
FOR THIS NEGRO
Vinings Station, Ga., July 20.- Automobiles
and blood hounds started today in
pursuit of a negro who criminally assaulted
Mrs. Exy Brown near here this
morning.
The automobiles were filled with a posse
of excited and heavily armed men, determined
to lynch the negro if they
catch him.
News reached here late this afternoon
that a negro answering the description
of the assailant of Mrs. Brown has been
captured near Concord. If the negro
should be identified a lynching is considered
inevitable.
Notwithstanding the news of the capture
of the negro at Concord, the search
for Mrs. Brown's assailant continued un-
immediate vicinity and
abated in this
members of the posse and sheriff's
deputies will guard the neighborhood
roads all night.
The negro arrested at Concord will not
be brought here for identification before
tomorrow. There is doubt as to his being
the right negro.
Mrs. Brown, who was attacked in the
backyard of her home, is suffering con-
from the shock, but her condi-
siderably tion late tonight is not considered critical.

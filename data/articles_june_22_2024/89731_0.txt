MURDERER PRAYS,
AND IS HANGED
MOB QUIETLY HANGS WOODWARD
IN WYOMING.
Pin Card on Body and Say That Law
Is Too Slow, and Warn Others to
Beware.
Casper, Wyo., March 28.- Charles
Woodward was lynched here last
night. Woodward killed Sheriff Rick
er of Natona county, while with other
escaped convicts he was seeking
liberty. He narrowly escaped lynching
when caught.
Today was to have been his execution
day, but the Supreme Court interfered
early in the week.
Twenty- four masked and armed men
bound and gagged the sheriff of Tubbs
county jail this morning. They took
Woodward from his cell and hanged
him on the gallows erected for his
legal execution.
Cloth was placed over Woodward's
mouth to prevent his outcries arousing
the people, who had gone to bed, expecting
to participate in a hanging
tonight.
Woodward asked the men not to
choke him. He begged to be allowed
to pray.
While the noose was being adjusted
he prayed piteously for his captors,
Sheriff Ricker, himself and his wife.
He pleaded not to be choked in his
prayers.
He was interrupted while kneeling,
aside and fell off the allows, sprang
off the gallows, and was
strangled to death.
The body was taken to the city hall,
where the following note was pinned
on his shirt:
" The process of little
was a
slow. This is the road you will have
travel; so murderers and thugs be
to ware."

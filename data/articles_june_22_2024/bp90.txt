The action moves the trial of the
lynchers, James Moore, Eunice
"Red" Kellum,
county,
Gore and James
where
from Chickasaw
the crime was committed to Cal-
houn county. Judge McElroy set
the next hearing for March 27,
1950, in the Calhoun county cir-
cuit court at Calhoun City.
The men are charged with mur-
der in the slaying of Malcolm
Wright, a Negro farmer, on Sat-
urday, July 2. The white mobsters
bludgeoned the Negro to death
with a bumper jack in the pres-
ence of his wife and five small
children.
Feeling Ran High
Indignation over the crime ran
high among the better class whites
in Chickasaw county. Their de-
mand that the lynchers not be al-
lowed bond was believed reflect-
ed in refusal of the court to release
the men from jail, pending their
trial.

The change of venue pleading
was made after a hearing on the
question was held. About 20 wit-
nesses offered opinions as
whether they thought the three
white men could get a fair trial
in the lynching of the Negro. A
number testified that they could,
while several others expressed
"doubt."
Wright was beaten to death by
the white men while driving a
team of mules. His family was ac-
companying him to town to do
Saturday shopping. Moore, Gore
and Kellum, who were riding in
an automobile at the time, accused
the colored farmer of "hogging the
road."
The lynchers claim they killed
Wright after he struck at them
with a piece of iron.

MEMPHIS LYNCHING
Memphis, Tenn., May 29.- The
plans of the Tennessee Knights
of Pythias Grand Lodge, the Masonic
Grand Lodge and the National
Medical Association had
been arranged for holding their
annual sessions in this city dur-
ing the next few months, but
due to the presence in and
around Memphis of more than a
thousand murderers, who took
the life of a helpless human being
by burning alive several days
ago, the officials of these organizations
have heeded the protests
of hundreds of members of the
different organizations to mingling
with brutes capable of manifesting
such savagery as was
exhibited last week in the burning
of a human being, and a
change of plans is on at this time
to have the meetings in other
cities of the state. To hold the
meetings of these great organizations
whose memberships number
into the thousands would be
the means of bringing large sums
of money to the city as well as
giving it much advertisement
and the entire populace will feel
the effects of the change of meeting
places of the organizations.
The lynching of Ell Persons
without having the chance of a
fair trial for his life has greatly
enraged some of the best citizens
of this city and the feeling is yet
high. Not only did the bloodthirsty
mob lynch Persons who
was charged with killing a young
girl, but the head of the
white mob victim, who was burned,
was taken by a jew and one of
his arms was taken by an Italian
and thrown in front of the Solvent
Savings Bank on Beale St.,
a colored institution.
The action of the employes of
the Ford Automobile works in
closing up the factory and walking
out to witness the lynching
resulted in their being without
jobs on their return to the factory
. The managers made the
statement that it was their pur-
pose to conduct their business
and not to encourage the lynching
of poor Negroes by employes
giving their presence.
A joint meeting of the colored
and white ministers of the city
was held last week for the pur-
pose of insisting that the officials
take steps for the prosecution of
participants in the burning
the of Persons.

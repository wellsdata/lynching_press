ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN ARKANSAS- Lynch
Law. A friend who has recently traveled through
a portion of the State of Arkansas, and especially
through Red River Bottom, where the following incident
occurred, related it to us in our editorial sane-
tum as follows: A man by the name of Rogers stole
a horse from an honest old farmer of Arkansas, and
wended his way up into Washington county, where
he said he sold it to a farmer there. But upon his
not being able to give the name of the man, nor make
a satisfactory explanation, a company who had been
in pursuit of the horse and thief, took him into the
woods and tied him to a log, and gave him between
two hundred and three hundred lashes, well laid on.
This had the effect of bringing him to terms. He
then confessed where the horse was, and who were
his accessories. The company then proceeded to Red
River Bottom, where they found the misssing horse
and five fellows, whose business it was to steal all
the horses, and whatever else" would pay," that they
could, whom they hung to limbs of trees until they
were dead, dead, dead. Upon consideration of Rogers
having" turned," he was spared. As our informant
rode past the spot, where the edict of lynch law had
gone forth, and the horrible spectacle of its execution
was witnessed, one poor fellow was seen dangling
between heaven and earth, suspended by his neck to
the limb of a tree, whose branches extended across
the road, with this inscription written upon his back:
" Tennessee horse thief, if you like him better than I
do, you can take him down and bury him." We will
simply state that our informant is a highly respectable
gentleman, and this narrative may be relied
upon as true.[ Memphis Eagle.
This man Rogers is, we believe, the same for whose
misdeeds one Thos. J. Rodden was severely
by the lynchers, through mistake. bandled

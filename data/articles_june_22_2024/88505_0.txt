Marion, Ind., October 25.- Jessie Mc-
Clure, a farm hand, killed his two sons,
aged 5 and 7 years, this afternoon, leaving
their bodies in a fence corner. While
a mob was forming to capture and lynch
him, McClure drove on a run to this city
and gave himself up to the authorities,
He has been secreted by the officers who
fear threatened violence,
McClure parted from his wife a year
ago, taking the children to her father's
home. At noon today McClure drove to the
home of Mrs. McClure's father. He found
the children in the front yard and induced
them with candy to take a ride with him.
He drove a mile up the road, carried the
children to a fence corner and shot them
with a revolver. The oldest one was found
dead a few minutes later and the youngest
was dying.
To the jail turnkey McClure admitted
the murder of his two children, and said
he had killed them because his wife
left him and refused to see him. Said had
he:" When she refused to see me I decided
to be revenged and drove down the
road to a little clump of small trees. My
two children were asleep in the buggy.
When I slapped them it aroused my little
boy and he said to me,' Papa, what are
you going to do?" I put my hand over
his eyes and took my gun from my pocket
and shot him in the forehead, killing him
instantly. The shot awoke little Homer,
and I took him and fired a shot into his
head. They both fell to the bottom of the
buggy. I drove the horse to the side of
the road and lifted both bodies out and
laid them on the withered grass. I then
drove directly to Marion to the jail.
" The neighbors wiil lynch me when they
find out what I have done. I don't care
what you do with me. I am ready to die
and expect to hang for this crime. All
that I ask is to see my dear little ones
buried."
Late this evening it was learned that a
mob was being formed to come to Marion
tonight and lynch McClure. Deputy
Sheriff Williams spirited the murderer
away from the jail and started with
to Indianapolis. him

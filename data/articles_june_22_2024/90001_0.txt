A Negro Lynched Near Savannah, Ga., For
An Attempted Outrage.
SAVANNAH, Ga., Aug. 18.- Walter Asburg,
alias Berriam, colored, was lynched at Pooler,
ten miles west of Savannah, this morning, for
assault upon Lula Kissman, a seventeen- year-
old German girl, yesterday afternoon. The
assault was made upon the girl at her home
while the family was away. She was terribly
beaten in a struggle with her assailant but she
successfully resisted him. Her clothing was
torn from her body. Her face was terribly
beaten and gashed. One eye was closed. The
finger prints of the negro were on her neck,
and her cheeks were torn and bleeding. Her
neck was so wrenched that she was unable to
turn her head. The struggle must have lasted
several minutes. The floor and furniture were
covered with blood and the girl's hands were
bloody where she fought her assailant. Her
cries attracted a colored man who was near by
and who rescued her.
Asburg sprang through a door and escaped,
but in the next house he knocked down a woman
and seized a double- barrelled shot gun
and fled to the woods. In an hour the whole
town was in arms and a mounted posse in pursuit
. About midnight the negro was found
at
a low dance about a mile from the scene
of the assault. He was taken back to
the girl's house and she identified him
as her assailant. His clothes were covered
with blood from the encounter with the girl.
He confessed his crime and begged for mercy.
Three hundred masked men hurried him to an
open field near a railroad, where he was strung
up to a tree and riddled with bullets. Across
his body was pinned a paper with the inscription
," This is the way we protect our homes."
Asburg asked for time to pray, which was
given him, and he begged that word be sent to
his wife. The body was left hanging all day,
and the coroner will go up to- morrow to cut it
down. The authorities attempted to interfere
prevent the lynching but the masked
and crowd was so great that they could do nothing.

MARTIN LYNCHED WITHOUT PROOF LYNCHED WITHOUT PROOF
Idabel, Okla., April 7.-This city en-
gaged in "Georgla's Pastime" on Sunday
morning by lynching Oscar Martin on
charge of having assaulted a 13-year-old
white girl. With blood in their eyes to
disgrace the Sabbath day, the only sport
these flends could enjoy was to "lynch a
nigger." A little girl by the name of
Edna Murphy became hysterical and in
this state she said things out of her
head that caused the "red necks" of
this city to jump at conclusions. Martin,
who was a stranger and was just passing
through the city, was grabbed up by the
; officers and taken to jail. There was a
preliminary hearing held in the district
. court room and the examination was lis-
tened to by the "hungry crowd." There

was not the slightest evidence to prove
that Martin was the man. No one could
prove that he was guilty. The greatest
exhibited in
court was pulled off on this occasion.
The men just deliberately took the man
out of the court and on the balcony of
the court house, placed a rope around
his neck, tied it to the railing of the
gallery and Martin was shoved off the
rall, falling about ten feet. Martin strug-
gled for his life and pulled at rafters
that he might support himself, but ho
was pulled away from the support and
a couple of bullets put an end to his life
and his body hung in the air for a spec-
tacle for the younger generation of the
white race to see and point to with
scorn.

our people without evidence.

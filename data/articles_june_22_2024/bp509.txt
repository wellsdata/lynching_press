Act On Lynchings On Lynchings
Editor, The Pittsburgh Courier,
Pittsburgh, Pa.
Dear Sir:
I have read the views of many,
many writers, and recently so much
stress has been laid on the topic of
mob law and lynching, that 1, for
one, have been waiting for some-
thing worthwhile to materialize.
I offered a solution a few weeks
ago by offering to go with a gang
of men to the southern cities and
rural districts and put on a Chicago
gang act, I have secured a number
of names from different states, who
have volunteered their services for
such a movement, but the only
MAN who wrote me was Bill Wash-|
ington, right here in Cincy. The
others were all married men and
would not do for a cause of this
kind.Â¸. The singie men have not
come forward for they do not seem
to be interested yet it seems to be
these follows that are the direct
cause of the race trouble by taking |
a second look at some little white
tramp, on a dark night.
I have been so severely criticized
for my action, and one colored or-
ganization advised me that I was
inciting a young war; that I have
been compelled to do what we have
been doing all this time-walt.
One writer stated two weeks ago
that we were forging ahead, but
she should be running around the
country day after day and see how
we live as a majority. Of course,
we that are in nice cozy homes in
the north little realize what it is all
about. This writer bases her claim
on the fact that we have such a
large number of lawyers doctors,
and other professionel people, but
I would like to show that writer the
names and addresses of Pullman
porters, janitors, redcaps and com-
mon laborers, malds, waitresses and
laundresses with a college educa-
tion. She also stated further that
lynching was the only thing we
seemed concerned about, but I wish
to inform her and all other writers
that lynching is the taking of hu-
man life and I believe no education
can take the place of the people
who can offer a solution to stop this
evil cause.
We are fed up on the white-col-
ored and also white livered race
leaders. We are tired of promises,
This is the age when everything
must be proved and the quicker we
have some more real men of the
calibre of DePriest, who will not
bow and scrape, the better it will be
for our race. It would also be a
good thing if the young Negro
could learn that he has the most
beautiful women on earth and
should boost and glorify them and
leave the pasty-faced girls of the
other race alone.

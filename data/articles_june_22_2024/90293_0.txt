THE strike at the Brown Hoisting
Co.'s works at Cleveland, O., on the 2d
assumed a serious aspect. While 250
police were guarding 500 workmen
along the streets they had to use their
clubs on the strikers who followed.
Albert Saunders, an employe of the
works, was knocked off his wheel by a
brick and drew his revolver and shot
a striker, who died soon after. The
police hurried Saunders into an office,
but the mob wanted to lynch him and
the mayor had to order soldiers to the
before Saunders could be taken
scene to the station.

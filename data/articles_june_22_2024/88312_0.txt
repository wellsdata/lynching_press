NEGRO SLAYER IS
BURNED AT STAKE
Henry Lowry Pays Penalty for
Killings- Posse of Arkansans
Seizes Black From Officers on
Train at Sardis, Miss.
Little Rock, Jan. 26.- Gov. Thomas
C. McRae tonight characterized the
lynching of Henry Lowery, negro, at
Modena, Ark., as the most disreputable
act ever committed in Arkansas,
and declared that he would recommend
to the legislature that any
sheriff or officer who permits or does
not prevent the lynching of a person
in his jurisdiction be summarily re
moved from office.
Acting on instruction from Gov.
McRae, Assistant Adjutant General
Friedman this evening telephoned
commanders of American Legion
posts at Wilson and Blytheville and
urged them to take all steps possible
to prevent lynchings and preserve
order.
At Wilson the legion commander
said, however, that feeling against
Henry Lowery was so acute that he
doubted if the lynching could be averted
. Lowery was expected at Nodena,
near Wilson, Thursday. Plans had
been made to lynch him immediately
upon his arrival. The posse taking
him to Nodena had been delayed in
the Mississippi at Milling
ton crossing, Tenn.

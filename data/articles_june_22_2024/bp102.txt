mother taking her three sons to see
the John Brown statue at Quindaro,
Kan. She prayed and wept as she
explained Brown's heroism for black
people.
Elijah Lovejoy was bom Nov. 2,
1802, at Albion, Maine. He gradu-
ated from Colby College in 1826,
taught in Missouri and became editor
of the St. Louis Times, a Whig news-
paper. He did not like slavery and the
more he saw of it the more he hated
it. When a mob lynched a black man
in the area, he attacked the judge in
hi: newspaper for not prosecuting
the mob. Supporters of slavery and
the mob threw his press into the river,
but he and his supporters bought a
new press and he continued the anti-
slavery campaign from nearby Alton,

Ill.
Lovejoy's newspaper circulation
doubled as his campaign continued
but his enemics destroyed his press
again. Repeated confrontation be-
tween pro-slavery and anti-slavery
forces continued until one night when
he remained at his printing plant to
protect his press and was shot to
death. Lovejoy, like Brown, was the
son of a father who taught him to
stamp out sin, to correct wrongs done
to others and to oppose injustice.
Brown and Lovejoy were religious.
With American hunger for Civil
War movies strong as shown by
"North and South" and "Gone with
the Wind," time has come for a black
movie make like Spike Lee or others
to show the black perspective of those
times instead of sanitized versions
that soft-pedal slavery's wrongs and
coddle racists like the Daughters of
the Confederacy, Jesse Helms and
the Ku Klux Klan.
Millions of Blacks on 'John Brown's List' of Blacks on John' Brown's List'
BY JAMES E. ALLSBROOK JAMES E. ALLSBROOK
While millions of moviegoers ap-
plaud the prize-nominated
"Schindler's List," the world should
remember at least two other men
whose "compassionate" lists were
much longer, whose deeds were more
daring and whose sacrifices were
more costly. These men are the fiery
John Brown, called crazy because he
was an uncompromising, gun-toting
abolitionist, and the relentless Elijah
Lovejoy, called crazy because he also
was an uncompromising and persua-
sive editor and abolitionist.
Schindler's actions and those of
Brown and Lovejoy were somewhat
similar. Schindler was a white, in-
group German Nazi who managed to
save the lives of a thousand or more
German Jews by claiming he needed
workers in his factory. He lived
through the danger of keeping Jews
from probable death in gas cham-
bers.John Brown and Elijah Lovejoy
were white, in-group American anti-
slavery activists who fought with gun
and pen trying to free black people.
But unlike Schindler, both Brown
and Lovejoy were killed for their
sacrifices to free millions of black
slaves.
John Brown was born on May 9,
1800, in Torrington, Conn. He
worked as a tanner for his father who
was an abolitionist and an agent for
the Underground Railroad. He hated
slavery. Brown moved to Richmond,
Pa., in 1826 and set up a tannery and
an Underground Railroad station on
his farm. He lived in Ohio and
Masachusetts before following his
sons to Kansas to become more ac-
tive in the free statc, anti-slavery
movement.
After pro-slavery forces burned
and sacked Lawrence, Kansas in
1856, they killed slaves who had
escaped from the South, Brown and
his men answered by shooting pro-
slavery settlers. He gathered more
followers and decided to free slaves
by force. He planned to establish a
"free" state in Southern mountains
for escaped or liberated slaves and he
needed arms and ammunition to carry
out this mission. He tried to get these
arms at the U.S. Army Arsenal at
Harper's Ferry, W. Va., but during
his assault he lost 10 men including
two of his sons and two of the slaves
he had liberated.
His forces were outnumbered and
captured by Horse Marines led by
Col. Robert E. Lee, later head of the
Confederate Armies. Brown was tried
for treason and hanged in 1859 at
Charleston, W., Va. The execution
of Brown made him a hero and mar-
tyr of the abolitionist movement.
Songs were written in his honor.
Monuments and statues were con-

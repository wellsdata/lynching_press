MORE LYNCH LAW.
A shocking case of this kind occurred recently
near Evansville, Indiana. A merchant finding
five hundred dollars less in his safe than he had
left there, suspected the money was stolen by a
man who deposited the amount with him some
months before. He then proposed to the clerk to
take him to an island in the Ohio, and give him
as many lashes as he required to produce a confession
. The old man was tied by the neck to a
tree, and then received, as some thought, five
hundred,( probably three or four hundred) lashes.
His cries were hushed by drawing the rope tight
around his neck, his toes touched the ground. He
bore it nobly, and told them to kill him, but that
he would never acknowledge himself a thief.-
He was proved innocent by an alibi, and the money
paid to him the next day after. Great excitement
prevails. The guilty parties are highly
respectable, and can well afford to pay the
which their act of Lynching will cost them. cost

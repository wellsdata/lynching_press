KANSAS CITY, Mo., May 6.- The Star says:
The bandits and Mafia who seek refuge on
our shores are shot like animals of prey in
Italy. There is no reason why they should
meet with any more, consideration in the
United States than they receive in the land
of their nativity. It is to be deplored, of
course, that any combination of events in
America should render it necessary
for a
judicial body to condone a lynching, but the
report of the New Orleans grand jury proves
quite conclusively that such a condition of
affairs exists in that city and it is a plain
proposition that the slaying of the Hennessy
Rssassins was not only justifiable but that it
was the only means of redress under the
cumstances." cir

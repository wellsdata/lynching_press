NEGRO RAVISHER LYNCHED.
Officers Showed Fight, But Their
Prisoner Was Shot.
Texarkana, Ark., Dec. 17.- About a
year ago a negro woman was crimin-
ally assaulted by a negro in this county.
Newt Gaines was suspected, and officers
have kept a quiet lookout for him.
Yesterday Deputy Sheriff Ed Lynch of
New Boston heard that Gaines was in
De Kalb, and wired Constable Simonton
to arrest him. Today Lynch went after
him, and taking him from the jail went
to the depot to return Gaines to the
jail at New Boston.
While Lynch and Simonton were at
the railway station a mob of 100 men,
composed of farmers from Red River
valley, rode into De Kalb and demanded
the prisoner, charging him with raping
a white woman two days before.
The officers refused to deliver the prisoner
. Lynch, who is noted for his
fearlessness, drew a gun and showed
fight. The mob then surrounded the
station and began a fusilade through
the windows. Gaines' body was riddled
with bullets. The officers threw themselves
upon the floor and thus saved
their own. The mob then disappeared

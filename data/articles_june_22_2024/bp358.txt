E
NEGROES WOULD
NAME LEADERS IF
GIVEN PROTECTION
SIKESTON, Mo., March 5-(By Sam, McKibben for
ANP)--Two forces, the uncontrolled, unrestrained fear on
the part of Negroes; and the steadfast silence of whites, com-
bine and the most acrimonious ac' ir Missouri history, the
of Cleo Wright, 26- year- old
which no one will be punished.
Being one of the first two. No
gro reporters to reach the scene,
this writer is in a position to charge
that there. are Negroes willing to
talk providing they are given pro-
tection. To name any of the whites
involved, and there are some who
could, would be sheer suicide un-
less the state militia was called
out to protect them. After the trial,
if the witness lived through it, an
escort would be needed to get the
said, witness out of Bikeston.
JUSTIFIABLE FÉÅR
·
No one argues that it's better toj
be a live, coward than a dead hero,
but the Bikeston Negroes want!
justice done. If sufficient funds are
provided to tide them over until
they can make adjustments in oth-
er places, and protection given
them during the trial, there are
some courageous enough Negroes
to do what the whites refuse to do,|
name some of the lynch-party ring-
leaders.
Terrified, and driving into a rold,
penetrating rain that dull, blsak
and drab Monday morning follow-
ing the lynching, hundreds of Si-
keston Negroes fled never to re-
turn for their.meager personal ef-|
fects and household goods.
no
With nowhere to go but to the
grave after they talk, and
means of getting elsewhere if they
could after talking, the Negroes
sit tight and say nothing. Justice
will be thwarted just as the laws
have been flaunted!
ATTITUDE
OF WHITES
Sikeston whites dull their con-
science by firmly believing that
they had a duty to perform and
performed it to the best of their
ability. With that thought upper-
most in their minds, the whits ci-
tizenry remains adamant in a de-
cizion to know nothing and tell
less". In discussing the incident
with Negro reporters, the whites
smirk and make no effort to con-
ceal their elation.
It has been admitted, that the
local police authorities made' no
effort to protect Cleo Wright, and
the state highway patrolmen didn't
do any more, if results speak for
themselves. Wright was said to
have been under arrest,, yet he
wasn't confined behind the protec
tion of Sikeston's strong enough-
looking jail bers. .
TALK FAILS
The Sikeston chief of police, in
talking to this reporter, said that
he talked to the mob, asked it to
disband and did nothing when they
pushed him aside to claim HIS:
prisoner.
In the face of a set-up of this
nature, who can blame the Sikes-
ton Negroes for not naming the
whites they know and saw?; The
filling station operator who fur-
nished the gasoline, the man who
lighted the match are known to
Negroes because their respective
business places are in the immedi-
ate proximity of Bunset addition
where the lynching took place.
Money, we believe, will bring
some of the mob members to trial.
A fund large enough to get the
informant and family, if any, away;
from Bikeston, and tide them over
until the bread-winner found em-
ployment in a locality far remov-
ed from Sikeston, is a challengej
to the civilized world. Provide-the
money, the Negroes will name some
of the lynchers-the next move will
be up to Missouri.

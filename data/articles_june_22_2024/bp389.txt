Pens Other From
TURPENTINE AND TERROR AND TERROR
BAILEY
The Grand Jury of Perry, Fla.,
invited me to attend their sessions
investigating the lynching of Odis
Price, Negro. They wired me when
indignatnt protests from all over
the state became a bother. I could
tell them everything they already
know. They could convict at least
10 men. Yes, I could give them
the names of the people I talked
with and they could lynch them too.
On the afternoon of August 9,
Odis Price, 22 years old, married,
living at the Huxford turpentine,
camp nine miles from Perry, went
to fill his bucket at the well he
shared with a white family, the
Outlers. Mrs. Verde Outler was in
her yard, partially dressed. She
looked up, screamed, and reached
for her shotgun. Odis Price fled,
dropping his bucket. That night!
he was dead, his throat cut, his
body riddled with bullets.
"That warn't no lynchin'." said
the local newspaper editor. "It was
a nigger killin' and not news for
the paper."
The local Methodist minister
said: "It would do no good to pub-
licize the story. The nigrah in-
sulted a white woman. The men
at the camp took care of him. He
was killed."
It took strategy to interview local
authorities. Although it was 3 o-
clock in the faternoon of a week-
day, sheriff, coroner, undertaker,
and state's
attorney-all
were out.
The Grand Jury would like to know
the people who did talk to me. They
would like to know who directed
me to Mrs. Price's home out at the
camp. Of one thing they can be
sure. I got a minimum of informa-
tion from the courthouse. No one
came back to his office on the first
day, and no one was around all dur-
ing. the morning of the second day.
I finally saw the sheriff, but he
knew nothing. He was out of town
when it happened. No, the body
wasn't riddled with bullets-just
one bullet hole in the back of the
neck. I told him this didn't check
with the coroner's verdict, and
found out later I was correct. Had
any investigation been made? The
sheriff said no, why? I said that's
what the International Labor De-
fense wants to know: why? The
sheriff walked away.
The county judge, who finally
admitted he had acted as coroner
ex officio, knew even less. He
knew it had happened at the camp,
that the camp was inaccessible, but
could not say if that would indicate
the white workers at the camp
might be responsible. "Why are
you asking all these questions Who
He
are you anyway?” he asked.
didn't like the sound of Interna-
tional Labor Defense, and would
say no more. The undertaker and
state's attorney were still out. I
stayed around, obtained further
proof of the lynching, further testi-
mony that the throat was cut and
that the body of Odis Price had been
shot through with bullets.
In conversation with me Sheriff
Wilson of Taylor county denied that
Odis Price had been under arrest
at the time of his death. How-
ever, forced by protests to report
on the lynching to the governor,
the sheriff now admits that Odis
Price was in the custody of a depu-
ty sheriff "and the two were on the
way back to Perry. Before reach-
ing the hard road the dirt road was
blocked by cars and a group of
white men were there. Upon stop-
ping his car the doors were opened
and by force the Negro Odis Price
was taken from him. · Immediately
afterward the deputy was ordered to
proceed and the road was cleared
for that purpose." (Quoting from
the report of S. L. Wilson, sheriff
of Taylor county, made to the gov-
ernor, Oct. 6, 1938.)
There is no indication in this re-
port that the deputy made attempts
to obtain license numbers of the
cars or sought to protect by force
the safety of his prisoner. This.
and the fact that the sheriff denied
positively that Price was under
arrest make the lynching that much
more vicious, showing police par-
ticipation in the crime.
Law enforcement in Taylor
county supports and is supported by:
operators of lumber mills, owners
of turpentine camps. Should I have
gone to the Grand Jury with evi-
dence I obtained in two days evi-
dence that the sheriff could not get :
in six weeks? It would be useless.
Perry could have become an ex-
ample for the whole South. Im-
mediate investigation on August 10.
prosecution of the guilty instead of
strict silence and no inquiry, would
have given the county prestige not
only in this state but throughout
the nation.

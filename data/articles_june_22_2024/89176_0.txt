Doors and Gets Him.
Cairo, Ill., November 11.- Tonight Cairo
is one seething mob. Henry Salzneta
white man, and a photographer by trad
who killed his wife last July with as
axe, was taken out of the county jail
at 11:40 o'clock by the mob and hanged
to a telegraph pole and his body riddled
with bullets.
This lynching followed closely that of
Will James, a negro, earlier in the evening
.
The mob gave Salzuer a chance to
confess after the rope was around his
neck, but in his fright he could only
mumble that his sisters did the killing
.
This statement made the mob furious
and it
was hard work to keep them
off long enough to give Salzner a chance
to pray. The mob finally subsided and
a short religious service for the benefit
of Salzner's soul was held, after which
he was strung up, the rope being placed
over a telegraph pole at Twenty- first
and Washington streets.
Salzner was born and raised here, the
son of William Salzner, a hide and wool
buyer. He was a photographer and had
been married about two years. It was
known that he had had trouble with
his wife and it is said gave her no
money for food for herself and two small
boys.
Murder of Mrs. Salzner.
One night last July Salzner's wife was
found at home with her skull fractured
and a blood covered ax was found under
the bed. The two babies were playing
in the yard. Salzner had been seen
by neighbors about the house early in
the evening and after the crime was discovered
Salzner was found at the honia
of his mother, where he often slept at
night,
All evidence pointed to Salzner as the
slayer of his wife, and after the crime
was discovered Mrs. Salzner recovered
enough to accuse her husband of the
crime. The public
was incensed against
him and while a part of the mob was
scouring the city for the negro Alexander
time hung heavy on the hands of the
balance of the mob and when some one
suggested Salzner the mob rushed for
the county jail, where the man wanted
was held in the steel cage.
The sheriff and his crowd of deputies
pushed aside, and the battering
were
down of the door of the cage was at
once begun with sledge hammers they
had secured.
Breaking Down Doors.
The mob found some difficulty in breaking
the cage, as it was an entirely steel
structure, but after a half hour of telling
blows upon the door it gave way
and Salzner was secured. The mob rushed
him out of the back door of the jail,
which is in the basement of the cou
house, around the building, through the
yard and out into Washington avenue
and up to Twenty- first street, which is
a prominent corner and has a public
square and where there was room enough
to hold the crowd. Salzner was so badly
frightened that he was little more than
He cried
a crazy man. and begged
piteously for his life and was answered
by cries and blows from the mob.
When Salzner was asked for his last
statement, a
man, a stranger in the
crowd, stepped forward and said he believed
Salzner was innocent, whereupon
the mob fell upon the stranger, kicked,
struck him, and finally knocked him
down and it was by hard work by the
cooler heads of the mob that his life
was saved. He was compelled to beg for
mercy from the mob and announced in
a loud voice that Salzner should be
lynched, after which he was driven away
and all attention was given to Salzner,
who cried and begged and mumbled that
his sisters had killed his wife. His manner
only further turned the mob against
him, and it immediately clamored for his
execution.
After Salzner was hanged and while
the body was being riddled with bullets,
the rope broke and the body fell to the
ground, where it now lies, the mob going
away and leaving it.
Search for the negro, Alexander, still
continues and only his execution will
pease the fury of the mob. ap-

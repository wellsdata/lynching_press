Sylvester, Ga., Feb. 10.- Jim
Keith, colored, who charged with
the murder of Sheriff Moreland,
of Lee county, on December 18,
1915, was saved by Worth county
officials from a mob which lynched
five other colored men for the
crime, was acquitted in superior
court here last week. At his
first trial here a year ago Keith
was convicted on the theory that
he was in the conspiracy which
resulted in the murder of the Lee
county sheriff and was given a
life term. Further evidence,
however, has led to the general
belief that Mozelle Lake, a Negro
who escaped, is the murderer.
Keith, in January of 1916, was
removed from the Worth county
jail and carried to a place of safety
shortly before a mob, supposedly
from Lee county, took five
colored suspects of complicity in
the murder of Sheriff Moreland
from jail, carried them to
Starkesville, Lee county, and
there lynched in them.

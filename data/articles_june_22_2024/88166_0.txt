Rockport, Ind., Dec. 18.- Two negroes,
Jim Henderson and Bud Rowlands, who
waylaid, brutally murdered and robbed
Hollie Simons, a white barber, early
yesterday morning, were lynched in the
jail yard by a mob of 1,000 frenzied citizens
last night. The negroes were arrested
early and although Rowlands

clothing had blood stains on it, the men
claimed they were innocent of the crime.
In the meantime Sheriff Clemens of
Union county, Kentucky, arrived with
a trained bloodhound, in response to
telegraphic summons. a
When the dog was placed on the
trail he followed it until he reached the
house where Rowlands lived, six blocks
from the scene of the murder, and went
baying to the bed the negro had occupied
. This was enough for the excited
citizens. Within a few minutes a mob
of a thousand howling, bloodthirsty
citizens, with sledgehammers, ropes
guns, were running to the jail. and
Sheriff Anderson and his two deputies
made a stand and attempted to
protect the prisoners. The officers were
seized by the leaders of the mob, who
disarmed them. The sheriff was then
locked in a room and placed under
guard, but he stoutly refused to give
up the keys or tell where the
were hidden. prisoners
Battered Down the Wall.
Failing to get the keys, the mob
made a determined but unsuccessful
attempt to break in the jail door. By
this time the would- be lynchers were
in a perfect frenzy, and, securing a telegraph
pole, they used it as a battering
ram, and caved in the side wall of the
Jail. The door of Rowlands' cell was
then quickly broken in with sledges,
and he was dragged from the jail to the
east side of the courtyard, where a
noose was placed about his neck. He
was given time to make a statement,
in which he implicated Jim Henderson
and another negro. Rowlands then
begged piteously for mercy, but the
mob swiftly hung the confessed murderer
to tree and riddled his body
with bullets a.
Leaving the body of Rowlands dangling
from the limb of the tree, the mob
rushed back to the jail and attempted
to burst open the cell occupied by
Henderson, but before the steel bars
yielded to the blows of the sledges
some one in the crowd fired on the terrified
negro crouched in the corner of
the cell. A few moments more and the
door of the cell was broken in. The
negro, more dead than alive, was
dragged at a rope's end to the court
house yard and swung on the tree
side the body of Rowlands. be-
Firing a party volley at the swinging
bodies, the mob, eager for another victim
, hurried away to catch the other
negro implicated by Rowlands in his
confession. He was found at a hotel,
where he was employed as a porter.
The negro escaped to the roof of the
building, and Manager Debruler succeeded
in convincing the mob that the
porter had to do wtih the
crime, proving nothing an alibi for him.
The mob then dispersed, apparently
satisfied with its awful work of
geance. ven-
Committed Brutal Murder.
The negro's victim, Simons, was waylaid
and murdered in the most brutal
manner one square from the main
street of the city, as he was going to
his home from his barber shop, at 2
o'clock this morning. As was customary
with him, he carried the receipts
of the day at the place of
ness. busi-
The negroes were aware of this vi-
dently laid the plans accordingly.
Crouching behind a fence, they
awaited their victim and jumped from
their place of concealment and attacked
him from behind, striking him
over the head with a heavy club with
a large nail driven into the end of it.
Although terribly beaten Simons made
a desperate fight, and his cries and
struggles soon attracted two boys who
went to his assistance, but they were a
moment too late. The victim of the
two negroes had succumbed to the terrible
beating and was lying dead at
their feet. The murderers then drove
the would- be rescuers away and accomplished
their original dsign- that
of robbery- securing a bag containing
something over$ 40 from the prostrate
from of their victim, and made
escape. their

Murderer Lynched By Citizens of the
Mining Camp, At
Skidoo.
TAKEN AWAY FROM OFFICER.
Shot And Killed Prominent Man of
The Piace in Cold
Blood.
RHYOLITE,( Nev.), April 23.- Joe
Simpson, who murdered James Arnold
at Skidoo, Cal., fifty- five miles south
of Rhyolite, Sunday, was lynched last
night by the citizens of the California
mining camp. Early in the evening
the guard was overpowered and Simp-
son was taken out and hanged to a
telegraph pole. The lynching was ae-
complished quietly; and today no one
in Skidoo will acknowledge having
any information regarding the affair.
Simpson was hanged from the crossarm
of the pole to which he was bound
last Sunday after he had made an attempt
upon the life of Cashier Dobbs
of the Southern California Bank at
Skidoo. Simpson, who bore an unsavory
reputation, was intoxicated,
and after threatening Dobbs shot and
killed Arnold in what is said to have
been a cold- blooded manner. Arnold
was a butcher and one of the most
prominent men in the camp.
There was strong talk of lynching
at the time of the killing, but this
feeling died away, and it was thought
nothing would come of it. The
that
hearing of Simpson was set for Sat-
urday, and as the time approached, in
view of the fact that the killing was
regarded generally as cold- blooded
murder, the people of the mining
camp again became wrought up and
decided take the law into their own
hands. to

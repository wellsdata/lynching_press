A Murderer Lynched.
LEXINGTON, Mo., August 29.- Sheriff
Mitchell received a telegram from May
View this morning stating that E. F. Par-
ker, a merchant of that place, had been
murdered. The sheriff and two deputies
went to the scene of the crime. At Par-
ker's store, in a pool of blood, behind the
counter, with the head nearly severed
from the body, lay the body of the dead
man. The motive for the crime was evidently
robbery, for the cash drawer had
been rifled. In the afternoon a negro
named William Waters was arrested by
the constable for the murder of Parker.
He confessed, a mob took him from
the officers and and hanged him to a tree.

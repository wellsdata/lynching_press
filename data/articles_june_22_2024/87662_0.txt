Finch, the contemptible liar.
Samuel J. Finch, the insignificant and
contemptible puppy, the short tailed and
long eared jackass of the the Reporter, in a
long silly, incoherent, disconnected article
on the lynching of his abolition brother
Philipps, accuses certain members of the
committee who had charge of Philipps of
cowardice for not having returned to Lea-
venworth. On reading the Reporter's article
we immediately went in quest of Finch, for
the purpose of expressing to him personally,
what we shall take occasion to say before
closing this article, but could not find him.
The charge of fear on the part of any of
the committee is false and unwarrantable
and the author of it- whoever he may be=
is a vile, base, and unmitigated liar.
The Missouri river, at this point
has risen several feet since our last issue,.

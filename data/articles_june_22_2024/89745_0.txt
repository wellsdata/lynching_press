Saturday.
A well- authenticated report reached here
late this evening that six other negroes who
are known to have been connected with the
affair have been arrested and placed in
jail at Rison. The jail is not considered
very safe, and it is the general opinion
that before to- morrow morning all six will
be lynched. Excitement in and about An-
derson and Kendall is at fever heat
more trouble is expected. and

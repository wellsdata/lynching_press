Lynching of Italians in Colorado.
The deplorable lynching of several Italian
laborers in Colorado was naturally followed by
international representation and I am happy
to say that the best efforts of the State in
which these outrages occurred have been put
forth to discover and punish the authors of this
atrocious crim.
The dependent families of
some of the unfortunate victims invite by their
deplorable condition gracious provision for
their needs. These manifestations
against
helpless aliens may be traced through successive
stages of the vicious padroni system which
unchecked by our immigration and contract
labor statutes, controls these workers from the
mcment of landing on our shore, and farms
them out in distant and often rude regions.
where their cheapening competion in the fields
of bread winning toil brings them in collision
with other labor interests. While welcoming,
as we should, those who seek our shores to
merge themselves in cur body politics and win
personal competence by honest effort, we can
not regard such assemblages as distinctively
alien laborers, hired out in the mass to the
profit of alien speculators and shipped hither
and thither as the prospect of gain may dio-
tate, as otherwise than repugnant to the right
of our civilization deterrent to individual advancement
and hindrances to the building up
of stable communities resting upon the wholesome
ambitions of the citizen and constituting
the prime factor in the prosperity and progress
our nation. If legislation can reach this
growing of evil it certainly should be attempted.

Alabama's Legal Lynching-Florida's
st'egat Lynching
In Florida, near the offices of the
Governor, a mob took two Negro
boys of 18 years age out of jail
and shot them like dogs.-or rather
av men do not shoot dogs. There is
no use in going into the charges
against the boys: they were charg-
ed with "stalibing" a policeman
that
stah
with perket knife,-nt only ope
of the boys cut the policeman, the
other boy simply being present at
the time. And we all know
boys, even white boys, do not
at policemen with provocation,
in Massachusetts; much less is it
to be supposed that two Negro boys
in Florida will 'attack' a policeman,
It was said that the policemun was
questioning the boys about a rob.

bery-but we know how policemen
ask questions.'-often with a chub
or a fist. And if a Negro disputes
a policeman's word, it is the same
as if he attacked the policeman:
"You are call a white man a Har,
algger." We know these cases are
reported: they are reported
by
the whites. Nothing is told about
what the boys were suffering from
the hands of the oricer-only that
one of them stabbed the officer,--
not seriously. The mob lynched
them for striking Jack in self-de-
fense. That is the serious situation.
Then the mob pinned on the dead
bodles words to the effect that so
will all Negroes be treated. if they
"hurt white people.â€œ- making no
distinction about hurting in self-
defense. This denial of the right o
self-defense is the most brutal as-
pect of the whole situmtion.

the state authorities go forward

the Hmit by state law is of years.
There was some delay because one
of the jurors wanted to give him
only 75 years.-just to treat him as
a preceding jury had treated one
other of the defendants.
The New York TIMES makes
this mistake: it says that from this

human minds, and the same over-
whelming evidence of the boys'
innocence must have had the sange
effect on their average mind as on
the minds of the rest of mankind.
They have not agreed that the boys
are guilty. They have in their minas
that the boys are innocent, but
they have agreed that the boya
must be punished- TO DEFEND

TO SAVE THE FACE OF WHITE
ALABAMA.
What are we going to do about
it? We cannot do less than fight
until they have finally put all of
those boys in prison, those that
are not killed.-and then fight on
after they are in prison in an ef-
fort to get them out. Let us en-

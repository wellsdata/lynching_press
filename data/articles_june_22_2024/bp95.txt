Alabama Boy, 17,
Taken From Home
By Mob, Lynched!
BURKVILLE, Ala.—Rogers Hamilton, 17, was lynched here. He made the
mistake of getting interested in the "wrong" colored airl.
:
• Young Rogers was slain by a group of white men in the back of a truck
after he had disregarded "warnings" of white men to stay away from the "colored
$1.11
giris in nearby Haynesville.
He was shot to death during a lynching party which
has all of the earmarks of the notorious slaying of Emmett
Till which shook the entire world..
One of the worst "crimes" under the South's unwritten code
of "tradition" is for a Negro to get "interested" in a "colored gal"
who is the object of the affections of a white man. Rogers made
that mistake and it cost him his life..

●Death came to Rogers in
the "traditional" manner. On
either Tuesday or Wednesday
night, Oct. 23 or 22, a group of
white men went to the Lowndes
County home of Rogers and
asked his mother if he were
present.
After being told that he was
present, one of the men asked
Mrs. Hamilton, "tell him to come
out here, we have some ciga-
rettes for him." Answered Rog-
ers, "All right, after I put on
some shoes."
ONE OF THE criminals shot
back, "You don't need any g-d-
shoes." anatched him out of the
doorway and threw him into a
waiting truck.
An the truck drove away
there were ...sounds of fists
smacking against flesh and the
cries of Rogers, screaming for.
help, mingled with the anguish-
ed pleas of his mother crying
for her son's life as she ran
futilely after the truck until it
passed from sight.
Minutes later, a pistol shot was
heard and 30 minutes later an,
x yet, unidentified man returned
to the late Rogers' home and told
his mother where she could find
her son's corpse.
ROGERS WAS burled on Oct.
27, with services held from the
Baptist Hill Church. The Rev. O.
T. Harvey officiated.
● His interment occurred at
the Lowndesboro Cemetery. His
survivors include his mother,
Mrs. Beatrice Hamilton; nine
sisters, Matilda, Mrs. Rosa Bell
Means, Mrs. Mary D. Furt,

Young Rogers' lynching has
perhaps had the desired effect
upon the Negroes in Lowndes
County for they are bowing to
threats of intimidation.
Crosses have been burned at
Fort Deposit and Mount Willing.
Negro merchants have been de
nied goods to sell.
PERHAPS A premonition of
what was coming should have
told young Rogers to get ready
for any eventuality. About three
days before he was slain, Rogers,
in the company of two other teen-
age friends, was walking toward
Haynesville with the hope of pick-
ing up a ride.
A white woman driving a car
passed them, drove ahead for a
few feet, turned around and went
back in the direction from which
she had come. Within a few min-
utes she had returned with. a
group of white men..
Two of the boys ran, but Rog-
ers didn't and he was handed an
unmerciful beating and then told
to stay away from the Negro
girls in Haynesville.
EVIDENTLY, THE whites
were not satisfied with the
"warning" for they returned to
spirit Rogers away from his
home and execute him as an ob-
ject lesson to other "smart young
nigras" who might have designs
on the pretty browns" who live
In Haynesville.
The lesson did strike home to
Rogers. He gave up his life to
gain the knowledge.

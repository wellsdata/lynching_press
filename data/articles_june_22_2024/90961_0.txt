with them.
The truth of the whole matter is
simply this: the vast majority of the
Southern white men want to appropriate
or keep unto themselves, not
only their own women, but Negr«ù
women as well, and they are ever
ready to mob, lynch and burn at the
stake any- Colored man who attempts
to look cros" ed at a white female
strumpet.
The Negro must either shoot or
club this idea out of the minds of the
White men of the South if he desires
to posses his women as, his own.

MAY YET ORGANIZE
A NEW REGIMENT
Montgomery Headquarters
Asks Huntsville To Form
Military Company
Huntsville, March 30 .-( Special.)- A
new regiment of the Alabama National
Guard will be organized during the approaching
summer if enough companies
can be formed, according to information
wired to this city from Montgomery
last night. Military authorities have
agreed that Alabama has not as large a
citizen- soldiery as its population en-
titles it to and the higher military authorities
have set out to form a new
regiment. Huntsville has been asked to
organize a military company to become
a part of the new organization. There
has been no military company here
since Company F of the Third regiment
was mustered out seven years ago for
failing to fire on the mob that lynched
Horace Maples at the Madison county
jail. Efforts have been made to organize
a company several times since
then but the state officers at Montgom-
ery have given no encouragement. Those
officials who stood in the way of a
new organization here have passed out
office and it may result in the forma-
of tion of another company here.

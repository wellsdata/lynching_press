Lynching. Story of the
The men had been under the custody
of Deputy Sheriff Tom Kelly and they
were taken from under his control by
the mob and hanged to a beef windlass
several hundred yards from the jail,
where their bodies were still swinging
to the breeze all during Sunday, the
coroner not having yet arrived and no
one else volunteering to cut them down.
There were about 40 men concerned in
the lynching. They rode into Wil-
liamsport on hoseback late at night and
tethered their horses a short distance
from the city that they might secure
them again as speedily as necessary
after the deed was done. The jail in
which the prisoners were confined is a
substantial stone structure and was in
charge of Deputy Sheriff Thomas Kel-
ley. Since the confinement of the
oners therein so great has been the fear
that they might escape in some way
that one man has marched all night
within the jail, and Friday night Kel-
ley was on watch. There was a meeting
of a lodge of woodmen in a building
near the jail, and as Kelley was a
member he expected to meet some of
the members of the lodge after the
meeting had adjourned. To while
away the time during the night hours
he was playing solitaire in front of the
cells in which the murderers were
fined. con-

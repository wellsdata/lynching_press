NEGRO IS HANGED
BY ARKANSAS MOB
Little Rock, Ark., July 7- Sam Powell,
a negro charged with robbery and arson,
was hanged by a mob at Huttig, Ark.,
late last night, according to a dispatch
received here tonight.
Powell, an 18- year- old youth, it was
charged, hurglarized the residence of the
prominent citizen of Huttig of$ 400 and
then fired the building. He escaped, but
was captured several days ago at Ro-
chelle, La. Since his return to Huttig,
it is stated, he confessed.
The rather frail prison building which
housed Powell was broken into without
much effort by the mob and the lynching
followed. The fact that the negro had
been hanged, however, was not generally
known until his body was found today.
The verdict of the coroner's jury this
was that Powell came to his
afternoon death at the hands of unknown parties.

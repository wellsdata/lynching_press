China Speaks Speaks
op
the news of the abolition of the
Poll Tax will appear. All the
pressed people of the world, and
especially the people of the Far
East are watching with keen in-
terest how the struggle for liberty
and liberation is getting along, in
America. All the people of the
world are anixous to see whether
the State of Mississippi and the
United States will punish these
lynchers or not.
WILLKIE, A GREAT MAN
Not only the Negro people are
being lynched and discriminated
against, but the Indian people are
still being denied their freedom
and independence. Under the Axis
powers,
millions of Europeans,
Americans, Jews, Chinese, Negroes,
Filipinos, Burmese, eto, are still
being enslaved and imprisoned, and
in this whole struggle of liberty
and liberation, we want to see to
it that they are all free.
OVER in China, we still cannot
Mr.
get over the visit which
Willkie gave us a few days ago.
We certainly like him, because he
speaks for the people of the world.
He pulls no punches. He demand-
ed the immediate opening of a
Second Front, the extension of At-
lantic Charter to the Pacific, and
the end of imperialism, and he
speaks for all of us. During this
trip. Mr. Willkie grows into a
great man.. Though the defeatists
and isolationists in America and
England sneered at him, but these
men only exposed their true
"faces." We will hear more from
Mr. Willkie, and the Chinese peo
ple wish him: "Nulih"-"More pow-
er and strength."
Mr. Liu Liu
which one is not, therefore, the
leaders of the Negro people should |
let the people know the past record
of these candidates, what do they
stand för and let the people make
their own choice. The responsibili-
ty of the Negro leaders is certain-
ly doubly heavy.
DEPLORE LYNCHINGS
I am very sorry to and that Mr.
Edgar G. Brown, an outstanding)
leader of the Negro people and the
director of the National Negro
Council, had declared that "the
only way to help the morale of the
Negroes in this world crisis and
strengthen the cause of democra-
cy for which we fight is to elect
Republicans to Congress." Can Mr.
Brown assure us that all the Re-
publican candidates are win-the-
war candidates? In a world crisis
like this, we must set aside poli-
tics
political
and
and
parties,
strengthen the cause of democracy
for which we fight, we must elect
the man rather than his party.
THE struggle for liberty and lib
eration is a long process, and
the abolition of Poll Tax will be
only the end of a chapter, but it
is by no means the end of the
process. As a matter of fact, this
is only the beginning of another
new chapter. Poll Tax has been
abolished; but jim crowism is still
existing. On the same day when
the Anti-Poll Tax bill passed the
Housé, ; down in Mississippi, at
Clarke County, a mob lynched two
fourteen-year old Negro boys. This
is the third and fourth lynchings
in America in 1942. This lynching
news will appear on Chinese news-
papers in speciął bracket, just as

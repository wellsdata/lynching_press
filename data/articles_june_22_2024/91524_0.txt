NEGRO SHOT TO
DEATH BY MOB
Wounded Policeman, Is
Dragged From Hospital
Bed and Shot.
Montgomery, Ala., Sept. 30- John
Temple, negro, who last night shot
and fatally wounded Policeman John
Barbare and who was wounded by
the officer, was shot to death in a
hospital shortly after 2 o'clock this
morning by a small band of white
men.
He was the third negro to die
by lynch law within a period of 12
hours, Miles Phifer and Robert
Crosky, the latter a discharged soldier
, having been shot to death by a
mob five miles from the city yesterday
afternoon. Still another negro,
Bird Astor, who was with Temple
when Barbare was shot, was being
sought by a posse and it was believed
capture would result more vio-
| lence.
There was no connection between
the lynching of Phifer and Crosky
and the killing of Temple. The first
named two charged with crimes
against white women, were taken
from three deputy sheriffs by a mob
of about 25 men five miles from the
city. The negroes were told to run
for their lives, and as they started
were shot down. The mob
then
quietly dispersed.
Last night Policeman Barabre arrested
Temple, Astor and a negress
on a charge of disorderly conduct as
a result of a row following a dance.
Temple resented his arrest and shot
the officer, but not until he himself
had been wounded. In the
Astor fled. meantime

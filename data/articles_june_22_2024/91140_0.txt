Indicts Negro
Grand Jury
Mob failed in Attempt to Lynch Negro Murderer. Reeks Vengence
Negro Business District Destroying much Property. Judge
in Judge J. W. Swayne Instructs body to Investigate and Act.
Ft. Worth, Texas was the scene
of much blood shed last week when
Tom Lee killed two Negroes, one
policeman and two other white
men and then attempted suicide
but at this writing is still living
with a chance to recover. On account
of the heavy guard a mob
failed in its attempt to take him
from the jail. Failing in this effort
, the mob went to the Negro
business district and demolished
it, the saloons suffering most, as
all the wines, whiskey and cigars
were carried away. Grocery stores,
restaurants, barber shops, tailor
shops, pool halls, undertaking establishments
, and the Negro bank
in the Masonic Temple were all
demolished, the damage totals to
about$ 15,000.00. The leading
white citizens are very much
wrought up over the affair and at a
mass meeting condemned it in
most bitter terms.
Judge Swayne whose reputation
has long since been established as
an unbiased judge, instructed the
grand jury as follows:
Judge Swayne instructed that
indictments be returned against
the offenders for unlawful assemb.
ly and rioting. The Grand Jury
was taken in a body to view the
ruins of the stores, saloons, shops
and other buildings. The Court's
eharge was as follows:
" I was before you this morning
and at that time asked you to return
a bill of indictment as quickly
as possible against Tommie Lee,
the Negro who did the killing yesterday
, and I am very much ob.
liged to you for acting promptly in
have just re-
the matter. You
turned a bill of indictment against
him.
" This is as it should be. The
Grand Juries of the country and
the courts of the country in murder
cases should act promptly.
There has always been too much
delay. It has been my rule and
practice since I have been District
Judge to never let a criminal case
lag, and especially a murder case.
I try them quickly, whether high
or low. The constitution guarantees
them a speedy trial and it also
guarantees society a speedy
trial. That is my interpretation
of the Constitution.
" Now, gentlemen, I have sent
for you for another purpose. Since
was before you this morning
I privately some very estimable cit.
fizens have called my attention to
the outrageous conduct of the mob
on Ninth street against some of
our respectable Negro population.
It was my lot to be one of the officials
present at the jail last night
when the mob attempted to take
it. You know I charged you a few
days ago about some outrageous
conduct that had been committed
by people in high places, I charged
you then that no man was too
high when he did wrong. I charge
you now that no man is so low
that his conduct should not be investigated
when he is a violator
of the laws of this State.
" Those who composed the mob
cannot say that they were not there
for unlawful purposes, because, as
the law directs, it became my duty
as one of the Magistrates of this
State to call upon them to disperse
and tell them what the law is, and
I did this in no uncertain terms;
and after they failed to disperse
each and ever one of them was
guilty of the conduct of the other,
whether he participated in it or
not.
" Their conduct at the jail and
their conduct against the respect
able Negroes on Ninth street was
absolutely indefensible. Some of
the Negroes who were damaged
own their own property; some of
them have been good citizens ever
since they have lived here and at
all times have tried with all their
power to encourage the enforce-
ment of the law among their race.
" The police officers notified the
Negroes on Ninth street that there
might be some trouble and requested
them to close their doors at 5
o'clock yesterday afternoon. They
complied with the request and left
their property there without any
protection save by the officials of
the city of Ft. Worth. Imagine
their feelings when they came
back this morning and saw thous-
ands and thousands of dollars'
worth of property destroyed in
such a ruthless manner!
" Gentlemen, Investigate it! In.
vestigate it thoroughly! It matters
not who is guilty, return return a
bill against them. Each and ev-
ery man that was in that mob at
the jail or on East Ninth street is
guilty of an unlawful assembly and
guilty of riot.
" Return bills against all who
in mob. The advertisement
were has gore forth of what has been
done; let the advertisement go
forth that the law- abiding white
citizens of Tarrant County do not
sanction lawlessness in any way;
that we protect the low as well as
the high, and high as well as
the low." the

THE GROWING MENACETHE
When thoughtful people of the
United States awoke to the savage
tendencies of that element that en-
gaged in lynching, whereby Negroes
who were accused of certain crimes
were taken out by a mobÂ¹ of hoodlums
and killed, the warning was issued to
the courts of the land that some means
should be employed to curb such ac-
tivities. The far-sighted element bas-i
ed their warnings on what would re-
sult in years to come. They knew }
that the ignorant, savage element in
States like Georgia and Alabama had
allowed their consciences to become
iseared when they employed cruel mo-
1 thods of slaying dogs and dumb ani-
mals. This same element later satis-
fied their thirst for blood by slaying
defenseless and in many instances, in-
Inocent Negro men. They later snatch-
ed Negro mothers from their nursing
babes and in the most cruel and in-
human manner, killed them. The
faint cry of the officers of the law in
those parts did not serve as a deter-
rent and the few earnest nien and wo-
1 men who realized that such practices
were un-Christian and savage and that
such if allowed to continue would
prove dangerous to all peoples, ap-
peared to be afraid to speak out.
Whenever the opportunity afforded,
the latter element sounded the warn-
ing that the very
Intion of the
law of the Nation was being under-
mined when such was allowed to con-
tinue and they issued pleas for action
on the part of officers of the law to
the extent that the guilty Individuals.
who persisted in taking the law into
their own hands and slaying human
beings, should be punished for their
crimes.

The predictions have come true and
today the State of Georgia is all arous-
ed over the slaying of a white citizen.
The sheriff of a Georgia county was
I close enough to the mob members to
get scratches on his hands, yet he is
unable to identify the ones who took
a white prisoner from his custody and
lynched him.

Again Alabama comes to the front
with the brutal and cowardly slaying
of a court official and the wounding of
his wife, by yet unknown assassins
who fired loads of buckshot into their
homes from ambush.
Thus it is. The cruel slaying of
dogs and other dumb brutes, without
punishment. Negroes were killed and
the perpetrators of the crimes were
allowed to go unpunished. Now, the
crimes are brought within the very
ranks of the race who are the law
makers and whose members go to
make up the officers of the law and
then it is that an effort is made to curb
the savage acts. Certainly it would
have been better to have nipped the
sacts in the bud in the early stages and
furthermore, unless the national gov-
ernment takes the matter in hand, the
situation will prove a menace that will
be far worse than any that have ever
existed in Russia.

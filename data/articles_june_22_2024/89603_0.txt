Henderson Among First to Reply
Charles Henderson, whom Mr. Comer
declared to be the" maverick" captured
by the Louisville and Nashville,
and branded as its own, issued a formal
statement." He must substantiate
these charges," said the president of
the railroad commission," or prove him
self to be one who invents and eir
culates untruthful statements for his
own benefit."
Sam Kennedy, secretary of the rail
road commission, and who also was as

statement that he had only his good

of the offense for which the mob

make you,' remember the Alamo.'" As
is known, Mr. Comer referred to Mr.
McCord in the same breath with which
he referred to the late investigation of

those whom Mr. Comer has assailed
that the indications are that unlike in
the campaign of 1906, Mr. Comer will
not be permitted in this campaign to
indulge in vitriolie references to the
injury of his enemies unchallenged.

another Alamo Gas steal in the event
Leon McCord and S. P. Kennedy were
associate members of the state railroad
commission, Mr. McCord hurled his
defiance at Mr. Comer this afternoon in
a written challenge to the latter inviting
him to meet him in from one to 50 joint
debates.
" Let us not bandy words," said Mr.

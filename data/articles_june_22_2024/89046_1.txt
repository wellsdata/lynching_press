Excited Over the Lynching.
Naples, July 31.- The Neapolitan
press has gone hysterical over the
lynching of Italian subjects at Tallu-
lah, La. All the papers call loudly on
the government to press its claim
against the United States, and some
of them go so far as to charge the
American government with encouraging
the lynching of foreigners, trusting
to the want of jurisdiction on the part
of the federal authorities as a
of escape from responsibility. means

WHY THE LYNCHERS QUIT
Chicago Evening Journal, Aug. 18.
Canada had a narrow escape from
a lynching the other day, but- she
escaped. The mob got hold of the
prisoner, who is charged with a dastardly
crime, but the habit of fair
play was stronger in the would- be
ynchers, and they allowed the man
to speak, He declared his innocence.
and the crowd, still governed, even in
its wrath. by the long habit of giving
accused men a fair chance, handed
him back to the officers of the law to
be held for trial.
What would not patriotic Amer-
ieans give if lynching parties on this
side of the line behaved the same
way!
The traditional British respect for
law is strong in Canada, but that was
not the saving element in this case.
The mob had defied the law by raiding
the jail and seizing the prisoner.
It was the habit of fair play.
The crowd wanted to be fair, felt
that it had to be fair, even to a man
it believed to be one of the vilest
criminals; and then suddenly awoke
to the fact that there can be no fair
play without law,
Perhaps there may be a valuable
suggestion for our own country in
this fact. Perhaps if we talked less
about the majesty of the law and
more about fair play which the law
is designed to secure, we might make
more progress in stopping the lynching
outbreaks which are such a costly
disgrace to our republic. Why
try the experiment? not

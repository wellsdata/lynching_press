Why We Have Mobs We Have Mobs
By SAM W. SMALL
[In the Atlanta Constitution]
Did you ever get mixed up in a
great mob bent on lynching a fellow
creature? Well, don't do it!
It is one of the most horrific expe-
riences one can undergo, with very
rare exceptions. In my long career
as a newspaper man it has fallen to
me to be tangled up in four such
congeries of crazy. cruel, uncontroll-
able human beings temporarily
turned savages.
In one case two white men were
strangled to death from the same
limb of a tree. In another a Negro
was hanged from the crossties of a
railroad bridge. In the third instance
a Negro was strung up to a lamp-
post in the public square of a south-
ern state capital. And in the fourth
case a Negro was hanged to a tele-
graph pole and riddled with bullets
from a hundred pistols.
All these mob lynchings were in
southern states. In none of the cusOS
were the mobbers masked or hooded,
and no attempt was made to disguise
any of the participants. In all of the
instances officers of the law protested
the proceedings strongly, but were ef-
fectually prevented from interfering
with the mob's operations. In each
case
confessedly
the vietim Was
guilty of the crime charged. hut he
was in legal custody and would surely
have been convicted and legally exe-
cuted. The lynchings were absolutely
uncalled for.
The Mind of the Mob
I would Fooner meet the Devil in
full flaming regalia on any highway
than to meet and oppose one of our
common city or countryside mobs.
The devil is a fellow of uncommon
sense. He is willing to argue a caso
with you.
He did that several times
even with Christ. And when you
resolutely command him to "Get thea
hence!" he gits.
But with a raging-hearted mob it
is a different case altogether.
It is often said that a mob has no
mind; that it is mass madness and
wholly impelled by a common primi-
tive impulse that puts aching ruge
beyond the reach of reason and all
our civilized and Christian inhibi-
tions.
But that diagnosis does not accord
with my experiences with mobs.
Each one of them had a master mind
at the head of it and the masa behind
the master had caught his spirit and
come to "one mind and one heart"
for the business at hand.
On the occurrence in the commu-
nity of some unusual, unprovoked, or
peculiarly brutal crime the people
become excited and naturally en-
raged against the perpetrator. If he
is at large they organize a man-hunt
to capture him and bring him to jux-
tice. If he has been quickly taken
and jailed they discuss the evidences
of his guilt, the enormity of his of-
fense, and the probabilities of his
being adequately punished.
How the Mob Genders
In those sidewalk or roadside dia-
cussions the mob genders. An indig-
nant impetuous man suggests that
the only right thing to do is to "take
the damned scoundrel out and hang
him!" He voices the universal in-
stinet of self and home defense.
becomes at once the prime minister
of that law which is axiomatic in
burharian tribes as in civilized gov-
ernment-"Salus populi suprema lex
est!" the welfare of the people is
the supreme law!
Ho
In the case at hand the law has
been outraged, the safety of person
and domicile violated, the security of
the community imperiled,
course of common justice is too slow
and the
and uncertain to assure penalty upon
the criminal and protection to society.
Such is the argument that does not
need a convention to affirm it or elo-
quence. to make it convincing. It
makes aII electric conquest of the
psychology of the community and
when the leader selzes that moment
to say "Let's go!" hundreds echo the
ery and thousands follow famishly to
get the prejudged wretch and wreak
upon him what it believes to be
righteous vengeance.
They get him and promptly kill
him. They hang him. perhaps shoot
him full of slugs, perhaps burn him
at the stake. What matter? A hu-
man tiger. an enemy of society, a
murderer of men, women and chil-
dren, has been destroyed. The mob
feels justified and its members return
to normaley.
What Can Be Done About it?
No lover of organized law and or-
der will justify moh law. No Chris-
tlan mag or woman can defend it.
It is the sworn duty of ministers of
law and justice to denounce the mob
spirit. to prevent mob reprisals, to
catch and punish mob violators of
the constitution and the laws of the
land.
But each mob is its own Moloch.
It laughs at written law and hacks
its agents out of the awful picture,
I have leaned from a window above
a raging mob and seen it defy and
heat off half the police force of a
large city, led by as intrepid a chief
as ever served an American commu-
nity. As another spectator by me
remarked: "That is hell in action
and they are vainly fighting down
there!"
Brought down to brass tacks, the
only preventive of mob lynchings is
an educated, stern public sentiment
against them-a sentiment that can
impress upon the consciousness of
the most callous man in the commu-
nity that every mobber shall be hunt-
ed down like a wildeat and punished
as surely as any other blood-smeared
criminal.
Until every community shall de-
velop that public psychology no Dyer
federal anti-lynching law, no state
statute against rints and inob mur-
ders, no sheriff and no mobilization
of the military will end the periodical
orgies of Judge Lynch in this land of
the free. "Necessity knows no law"
and a mol always aets from the con-
viction that its work is an immediate
necessity.
Courts as Contributors
During the past 40 years I believe
it not extravagant. to say, I have
heard probably a thousand men ex-
cuse mob lynchings on the ground
that the people had no confidence in
the certainty and celerity of justice
through the courts.
How can that sort of common feel-
ing be dealt with? When Judges can
be generally charged with playing
into the hands of the defense law.
yers of criminals and opening to their
use every possible loop-hole of the
law, a situation obtains where the
majority sentiment of the community
will more surely sympathize with the
mob than with the magistracy.
No law that congress or a state
legislature can enact will stop a moh
in any community that arises from
the conviction that it must du a work
of Justice that it cannot depend upon
its court to do for the safety and
satisfaction of the people.
For the last 36 years we have had
more than one lynching per month in
the state of Georgia.
The percentage of homicides in At-
lanta aione is 42 per 100,000 of our
population.
How many murderers, rapists, bur-
glars with weapons, and house burn-
ers have been hanged or imprisoned
for life for their crimes in the past
decade?
Count them and then you can un-
derstand why we have a lynching
now and then!

A Southern Statesman
The question of whether lynching is justifiable is
figuring in the United States senatorial campaign in
South Carolina, unbelievable as it may seem.
Senator Coleman L. Blease, up for re- election, discussed
the subject in a campaign address.
" Whenever the Constitution comes between me
and the virtue of white women in South Carolina,
I say to with the Constitution," Blease is
quoted as saying. When he was Governor, he added,
he did not call out the militia to protect Negroes
against mobs, and asked that when a suspect was
caught that he be not notified until the next
morning.
It would be difficult to equal such a statement for
sheer barbarity and demagogism. It is a deliberate
invitation to the people of South Carolina by an
acknowledged leader, who boasts that he has held
more political offices than any other man in the
history of the state, to supersede normal legal
processes with lynch law and mob violence. And
there has been plenty of that in the south in recent
weeks.
We can not believe that such savagery reflects
the views of the people of South Carolina. As a matter
of fact, Blease's opponent in the senatorial race
now is engaged in prosecuting seventeen men accused
of lynching Negro, and has asked heavy penalties
for them. a

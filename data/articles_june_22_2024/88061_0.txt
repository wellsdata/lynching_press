Washington, D. C.,. Nov. 15.- For
the first time in American history six
men are in prison tonight for contempt
of the supreme court of the
United States. For the first time,
ten, the federal government has placed
men behind the bars as an outcome
of the lynching of a negro.
At the United States jail in this
city Captain Joseph F. Shipp, former
sheriff at Chattanooga, Tenn .; Jere-
miah Gibson, his jailor, and Luther
Williams, Nick Nolan, Henry Padgett
and William Mayes, of the same city.
began this afternoon to serve termis
of imprisonment imposed a few hours
before by the supreme court of the
United States.
Shipp and Gibson had been found
guilty of failing to protect from a mob
Ed Johnson, whose legal execution for
rape had been stayed by the supreme
court, until that tribunal could review
the case.
The others had been found guilty
of participation in the lynching of a
federal prisoner. Shipp Williams and
Nolan were given sentences of ninety
days each imprisonment, while Gib-
son, Padget and Mayes each received
sixty days.
As the big Larred doors of the jail
swung open to receive the prisoners
this afternoon immediately after sentence
had imposed, Warden Mc-
Kee stood been before them.

Cairo, Ill., Feb. 18.- In a fight last
night between a mob that seeked to
lynch a negro charged with purse
snatching and five deputy sheriffs who
are guarding the jail, several members
of the mob shot in an attempt
to rush the were jail.
The mob was still gathered about
the jail at an early hour today and
was constantly increasing in size.
Sheriff Nellis entrenched his force
of deputies behind shuttered windows
and sent out word to the mob that he
would fight to a finish to protect the
negro.
The mob worked itself into a frenzy
and another rush on the jail is expected
.
The local militia company was ordered
out last night by Governor De-
neen, but the authorities have been
unable to find the company's officers
to lead the men.
Sheriff Nellis appealed to Governor
Deneen for the soldiers and outside
companies are expected.
One negro, John Pratt, was arrested
yesterday on a charge of snatching
purses from women. He later con
fessed. He was immediately indicted
by the grand jury and it is believed
the mob is after him.
The mob began forming shortly after
dark. As soon as the talk of a
lynching reached Sheriff Nellis he appealed
to Governor Deneen for troops
and swore in seven deputies, a crowd
gathering about the jail, but no attempt
to storm the structure was
made until shortly before midnight.
Sheriff Nellis made good his promise
to shoot, and several men in the
mob fell wounded at the first volley
Then the mob withdrew to a safe.

There Was a Prospect of the Man Escaping
the Gallows on Account
of His Insanity.
GOODWATER, Ala., July. 0.- Another
lynching was enacted in Alabama last
night. A mob of infuriated citizens of
Coosa county shot to death James Daniel,
a negro who had attempted an assault on
Mrs. John Baker, the wife of a white farmer
living near here. Baker and his wife
had retired for the night, and both were
asleep, when the negro burglarized his way
into their room. He went to the bed in
which Mrs. Baker was sleeping and threatened
her with death if she screamed. She
did scream, however, and her husband
rushed to her assistance in time to see the
negro jump from the window and escape.
A vigilant search with bloodhounds was
made for him. The track was lost and
found several times. Yesterday the dogs
struck it anew, and, after a spirited chase
of several hours, the negro was treed in a
forest in Coosa county. last night. From
his perch in the branches the offender
prayed to his pursuers to spare him, but
at a given signal a volley was fired into
the tree. It was too dark to distinguish
any object, but chance carried a dozen of
the bullets into the hegro's body, and
fell to the ground stone dead. he

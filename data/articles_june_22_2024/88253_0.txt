BILL PREPARED BY
FATHER J. M. LUCEY
The bill by Senator Toney, to prevent
mob violence and lynchings
which passed the Senate yesterday
Father Lucey of
was prepared by
Pine Bluff, A similar bill was prepared
two years ago, which passed
the Senate, but too late to take its
regular course in the house before adjournment
. The bill does not change
the law in any radical way. It provides
that when the crime of murder
or any capital offense has been
committed the criminal must have
speedy trial. In case the judge o
the judicial circuit in which the
crime was commited cannot at once
try the case in the county in which
the crime was committed, a special
judge may try the case. Supporters
of the bill claimed that mobs sometimes
form and lynchings result simply
because the excited populace fear
the prisoner will eventually escape
punishment and that swift retriba-
tion by the law will have a
effect. Little Rock Gazette. deterrent

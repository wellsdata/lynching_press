Little Rock, Ark.- Defiance of law
by business men and other leading
citizens marked the legislative committee's
investigation of the rioting
along the Missouri& North Arkansas
railroad. The committee was frankly
told that the strike interfered with
their business, and that law would
not deter them from smashing the
strike. This sentiment was behind
the lynching of E. J. Gregor, and sus-
tains every other mob demonstration.
State officials are in the face
of this anarchy. silent

A Mob Gathers and Undertakes to Lynch
the Brutal Parent- He Breaks Away,
and, Plunging in the River,
Drowned. Is
Cleveland, O., Sept. 28.- Just before
dark Sunday night Edward Wald,&
ship carpenter residing at 53 Mulberry
street, narrowly escaped lynching at
the hands of an infuriated mob of west
side citizens. Wald came home under
the influence of liquor, quarreled with
his wife and finally struck her. The
14- year- old son Edward seized his father's
arm and entreated him to quiet
down, whereupon the brute became enraged
and threw the boy down the stairway
leading to the street, a
of 20 feet. The little fellow screamed distance
patched for a rope. Wald had locked
himself in a bedroom. The door was
broken open, and the brute dragged
into the street, fighting desperately.
The police arrived before the rope appeared
and thus intercepted a lynching.
The mob gave battle to the police, determined
not to allow Wald to escape
them. During the scrimmage the prisoner
broke loose from those who were
holding him and ran down an alley
toward the river. The mob was close at
his heels and when the fugitive reached
the river, knowing that his chance for
life was less than even if captured,
plunged into the cold, muddy water of
the Cuyagho and was drowned. His
body has not been recovered. The boy
will die and the wife's injuries may
prove fatal. also

" A LADY MURDERED BY HER SERVANT-
THE LYNCH LAW APPLIED.- Granville county
N. C, September 18.- A fearful tragedy was
enacted some days since, near Buchanan, in
this county. Mr. Parthenia Harris, wife of
Haman Harris, was cruelly murdered by Of
negro woman, who formerly belonged to the
family, and still resided with them. Mrs
Harris was found dead in her yard, her head
having been crushed with a rock so as to
beat out her brains. The woman was arrested
on suspicion; confessed the deed, and
the neighbors executed summary punishment
her by hanging her to a tree.
No cause upon was resigned for the act.

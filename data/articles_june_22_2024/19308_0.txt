OFFICIALS LYNCHED.
Mexican Troops Kill and Wound Fifteen
People.
News has reached the Commander of the
Mexican troops in Neuvo Laredo, of serious
trouble which is now going on in Mier,
Mexico. The other Sunday a merchant
named Guteries was shot and killed by two
customs guards, who claim he refused to
stop and be searched on the road between
Mier and Camargo. On their arrival in Mier
they reported the affair and the citizens were
so incensed they raised a mob and lynched
them. About forty or fifty Mexican troops
and a body of fifteen or twenty customs
guards arrived there too late to save the lives
of the guards, and a general battle occurred,
resulting in the death and wounding of some
ten or fifteen persons Reinforcements were
telegraphed for to Matamoras..

THEY HAD TIME TO PRAY
A Bunch of Negrces Who Tried New
Guns On a White Man.
Sherevport, La., Nov. 30.- In the
press of a crowd of abcut 1,200 persons
, composed of whites and negroes,
Phil. Davis, Walter Carter, and Clint
Thomas, all negroes, were lynched
this afternoon about 1 o'clock within
a short distance of Belcher, which is
The
twenty miles from Shreveport.
men were executed for participating
in the fatal shooting of Robert Ad-
geer, a popular business man.
The negroes confessed their crime.
They stated that they were trying
new guns and when Adgeer appeared
cn the street they thought it quite
natural to turn the guns on him. No
shots were fired at the lynching, the
negroes all being hanged to the limb
of a tree.
Two of the negroes under arrest.
Sam Lee and Peter Thomas, were released
. Lee proved that he had attempted
to prevent the negroes from
shooting Adgeer, and Thomas established
the fact that he was too frightened
to shoot. Phil. Davis and Wal-
ter Carter were captured yesterday
several miles from the scene of their
crime.
Clint Thomas
was caught
later
about a mile and a half from Belcher.
The negroes were taken before Adgeer
and confessed their crime. They were
held in concealment until shortly before
1 o'clock today, when they were
taken out and hanged.
Davis is said to be an
ex- convict
and Walter Carter was forced to flee
from Mansfield, La., about a year ago
for insulting a white woman. The ne-
groes of Belcher joined in the search
for the men and apparently were as
to have them
eager lynched as the
whites. One negro was presented with
a purse of nearly$ 100 for the part he
took in the pursuit. The negroes were
given an opportunity to pray
being hanged. before

ON NIGHT OF THE LYNCHING
LITTLE DISCIPLINE SHOWN
Sheriff Rodgers Told the Mob
to" Come in and Get
the Nigger"
COURT OF INQUIRY IS
SITTING AT HUNTSVILLE
Testimony Shows That No One Seemed
to Know Who Was In Command.
Capt. R. L. Hay
Testifies.

19 .-( Special.)-
Huntsville, September
Three witnesses were examined here today
before the court of inquiry and the
most startling piece of evidence was that
of Sergeant Joseph Brock, who swore
that he heard Sheriff Rodgers call to the
soldiers to leave the jail and tell the mob
to stop setting fire to the jail and let the
fire department extinguish the flames and
" come in and get the nigger." The same
evidence has evidently gone before the
grand jury from what can be ascertained
tor ght.
The evidence also shows that the sheriff
called certain people in the mob by name
and that there was great lack of discip-
line and authority on the night of the
lynching, and that no one really knew

who was in command.
Captain Hay never reported to the sheriff
according to military tactics, which require
a man to say:" I report for duty
orders," or some similar ex-
and further
pression. Accoruing to Captain Hay he
reported at the jail further than to
never march his men there.

, and that if they had been properly
led they would have held the mob. Some
of them stayed in the jail and fainted
rather than to leave their post.
The courtmartial consists of Col. Tom
S. Frazer, chief of engineers on the governor's
staff; Capt. Ed. D. Smith, com-
officer of the Brandon Light Ar-
manding
tillery, and Capt. W. J. Vaiden of the
Second regiment. The court is in fatigue

Captain Hay Testifies.
The first witness was Capt. R. L. Hay,
commanding officer of Company F. Third
regiment, who was in command of the
company the night of the lynching. In
substance he spoke as follows:
" On the afternoon of the lynching about
4:30 o'clock my brother, Lieut. Tom Hay
came to my office and told me that the
sheriff had ordered the company to come
to the jail. I ordered him to get the company
together at the jail, and there we
issued cartridges and guns to the men
I saw Sheriff Rodgers there and asked
him if it was true that he had ordered
the company out,
" I did not salute him according to mini-
tary rules, but considered myself under
his command. I never used the words' I
report for duty and orders.' Later I received
a telegram from Cun-
ningham instructing me to Governor report to the
sheriff. The order came about 7:30 o'clock,
to the best of my recollection. I threw
out pickets, seven of them, around the
jail at the various corners leading to the
jail, and kept the remaining men, about
eleven, as a reserve at the jail.
Little Trouble In Dispersing Mob.
" I dispersed the mob at once and had
very little trouble doing so, although the
members cursed the officers and men.
When I reported to the sheriff I said to
him:' I want you to stay here, as we
are liable to have trouble.' He then told
me if there was any, trouble to sound
assembly and order all the men into the
jail. He did not give any orders to shoot
in case the mob attacked and revier during
the entire trouble would he allow me
to order the soldiers to shoot, although
I begged him and so did some of the
men in the jail after the mob had rushed
the lines.
" I left the jail and went up town a
short time after I had reported to the
sheriff. It was then that I received the
telegram from the governor, my brother
giving it to me. I wired back to him that
the company was in command at the jail
and asked for reinforcements, and also
asked if instructions had been sent to
the Birmingham company to come here.
I never received reply to this telegram.
" After I had gone back to the jail, and
about 8 o'clock, the mob rushed the lines
and assembly was sounded, but not by
my orders or by those of any one so far
as I knew. Shots were fired, but I don't
know by whom. When the mob rushed
the line and the assembly was sounded
I ordered the men into the jail, but not
until after Sheriff Rodgers had also done
so. He marched us to the second landing
of the steps and there we remained
until after the jail was fired and just
as the negro escaped.
No Order Given to Load.
" I do not know if any of the rifles of
my command were fired that night. I
did not inspect them to see. The order
to load was never given by me, and so
far as I know none of the rifles were
loaded.
" In the jail, after the mob had surrounded
it and had started firing it, I
said to the sheriff that it was pretty
warm and that he ought to do something.
He called to individual men in the mob
and advised them to go home. as he
did not wish to fire on them. The boys
in my command kept begging the sheriff
and myself to allow them to shoot, and
two of them were suffocated by the heat
and smoke and had to lie down. The
sheriff's son came to me and said.' Bob,
if father orders you to shoot. don't do
it.' He repeated this several times, and
also several times begged his father not
to order us to shoot. I had half a dozen
talks with the sheriff begging him to allow
me to shoot.
" I told that I would shoot and

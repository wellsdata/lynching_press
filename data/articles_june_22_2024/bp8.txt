Mexico. In the latter country that
problem is solved by the intermar-
riage of Spaniards and Indians, but
here by the extinction of the Indians.
The Negroes, therefore, undoubtedly
will continue to live as a special race
among their Anglo-Saxon neighbors,
And centuries will pass by before that
race has passed out of its present low
stage of development and reached
the same level as we. Until then we
have to take care of them as of chil-
dren, and help them along as breth-
ren and friends.
A-
During the last Grand Army en-
campment in Boston, I observed an
old veteran marching along slowly
and tired in a white regiment.
longside of the honorable army who
once saved the Union, were posted
young ladies from the best society of
Boston, who offered the veterans
cold water to drink, which was indeed
a welcome refreshment to the march-
ing soldiers. All the white comrades
had already been administered to,
but nobody cared for the black vet-
eran. Once he was good enough to
bleed for a country which had allow-
ed shackles to be put on his feet, but
now he was not worthy of a drink of
water. He looked sore and worn out.
At last a young lady stepped forward
and offered him a glass of water. I
never saw a face undergo such a
change as now did that of the old
veteran. In a moment he was all
sunshine. Every muscle and fibre in
that black image was bright with
smile and joy. And the smile did
not cease. It remained there like a
sunshine on a dark clould. I followed
him for a quarter of an hour,and still
the smile was on his face and in his
eyes; and it was a hearty, good-na-
tured smile, a smile of a happy child.
I understood the cause of that smile,
and it was to me a pledge for the so-
lution of the colored question, for a
man who could rejoice for being re-
cognized as equal to his white brother
is not beyond hope, and not his race
either.

NEGRO LYNCHING-A FOR-
EIGNERS VIEW OF IT.
(Twentieth Century, New York, Sept. 8)
in
It seems to me not to be altogether
out of place for me to make a few
comments on the race problem
this country. Born and educated in
Europe I may perhaps not be able to
view this question from the same
standpoint as native Americans, and
perhaps not even have a right to
meddle with it. But at the same
time I think that my being a stranger
enables me to look at this problem
with dispassionate eyes, which will
help me to do justice to the parties
involved. However that may be, I
beg leave to say what I think, having
paid some attention to the subject
during several years.
Europe has been and still is vexed
by race problems. None of them is
solved. But there races about equal
in education and intelligence live
side by side in the same community,
with the same rights under the same
government. They tolerate each
other, that's all. But where the
races are very much different, as the
case is with the Jews, even tolerance
cannot always be maintained.
wars, then, still occur. As far as I
know, there is only one instance in
Europe of an inferior race living in
the same country as a superior one
The Laps in Northern Europe are
nomads, or only half civilized.
they, as their kinsfolk, the Chinese
are quiet and retired, and give no
cause for serious troubles.
Race
But
The colored race in this country is
essentially different from any race
in Europe. The colored people are
a progressive people, capable of de-
velopement, and fitted to become
civilized. At the same time they
have their race peculiarities, and are
neither physically nor mentally
evolved from the state of savagery.
But it is only a question of time
when they will be. The white races
have gone through the same process
of evolution though under different
conditions.
Some time ago I lived in a State
where the colored people contributed
a large proportion to the population.
I took pains to see how they lived
and how they were getting along.
At an average they were in about
the same state as the poor people in
the large cities of Europe. They
were neither more poor nor more
morally degraded or ignorant. The
only difference I could notice was
undoubtedly due to racial and cli-
matic conditions. Their sexual in-
clinations are strong, no doubt, but
such is the case with all people liv-
ing in a hot climate. White men
very much oftener committed rape
on colored girls than colored men
were guilty of the same crime to-
ward white women. But invariably
the colored rapist was lynched, but
not the white one. And neverthe-
less, the crime of the latter was
greater than that of the former one,
For, leaving out of the question the
fact that slavery was demoralizing
to the colored people in this very
respect, not only the law, but also

gards crimes toward inferiors a
greater offenses than crimes toward
equals. If a white man commits
rape on a child, he is punished
more severely than if his victim had
been a full grown woman, which, un-
doubtedly, is just, too. Why, then,
should we make an exception if the
inferior victim has a black skin?
And on the contrary, an inferior
criminal is not as a rule punished as
hard as one of higher mental devel-
opment, because the responsibility is
not the same, Why, then, should
the Negro be excepted from that
rule? It seems to me that a formida-
ble injustice is committed to the
lynched colored rapist or criminal,
for the punishment always ought to
be proportionate to the responsi-
bility.
But the negro problem is a grave
one indeed, and it has to be solved or
serious troubles may ensue, resulting
in moral degradation to both parties
and perhaps to the forming of a
State within the State by the ex-
cluded Negro. But how can this
problem be solved satisfactorily?
It seems to me that we cannot ex-
pect a perfect solution, for different
races always will be antagonistic to
each other. The highest goal we can
aim at is to make the two races toler-
ate each other, for we never will get
beyond that. And meanwhile, let
the white people deal justly with the
colored race and try to educate the
coming generations. Education, in-
deed, is the capital means for the ele-
vation of the ex-slave and his chil-
dren. But not so much the education
of schools and colleges as the educa-
tion of life. I would not claim social
recognition for the Negro now and at
once,but certainly it should be accord-
ed to him as soon as he deserves it,
for else he will be kept back and his
progress stopped. A colored Baptist
minster once said to me: "What is
the use of the Negro getting educated
and graduating from a college or a
high school, for the only way open to
him is this." Saying so, he pointed
to a gang of colored men who were
busy with grading a street. I have
conversed with Negroes who were
just as intelligent and who behaved
just as nicely as any white person, and
have even been superior to the aver-
age white man, and I do not see why
the color of the skin should exclude
such a man from the company of his
white equals ar even superiors. An
educated and noble-minded Negro is
not more of a savage than the Presi-
dent of the United States. The Ne-
gro has many qualities which are apt
to make him, when educated and re-
fined, a pleasant companion in any
society. I think that especially his
musical genius is a quality which in
the future will make his people ac-
ceptable anywhere. Another way of
educating the Negro is using him as
a servant in our families. He then
will be brought in constant contact
with the white people and certainly
will gain by it.
I do not think the colored race will
ever be extinet or unite with the
white race. If the population of
America had been principally made
up of French and Germans, such
might have been the fate of the color-
ed people, but the Angle-Saxon race
never mixes with other races. We
can see that from the different aspect
of the Indian problem here and inLYNCHINE

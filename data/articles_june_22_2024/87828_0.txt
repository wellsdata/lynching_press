NEGRO PREACHER LYNCHED.
The Shock of the Brutal Affair Resulted in
" the Death of His Companion.
DUBLIN, Ga., Aug. 31.- A negro
preacher was lynched, and the shock
sustained by his companion caused
the latter's death, 15 miles from here
yesterday. The two negroes, William
Wright and Enoch Arline, both Meth-
odist preachers, went to Wilkinson
county to attend a protracted meeting.
They were on their re. urn home, when
suddenly a band of non confronted
them, stopped the horse, pulled Arline
from the vehicle and carried him to a
dense thicket beside the road. Here
the mob threw a rope around his neck,
and, without giving him a moment to
pray, pulled him up the tree, and kept
the unfortunate preacher there until
death relieved his sufferings. As soon
as this was accomplished the mob
rushed to get Wright, but he escaped
by lashing his horse and getting out of
their reach. He was badly frightened,
and on reaching home complained of
being ill, and in two hours he was
dead, death ensuing from pure fright
the horrible sight witnessed by
and him of Arline's fate.

The Jail Guarded.
HUNTSVILLE, Ala., June 10.- There is
an air of suppressed excitement to- night
and all kinds of wild rumors regarding a
mob being on the way from Decatur to this
city with the determination of lynching
the negro rapists, Thompson and Neville,
are heard. The Montesano Light Guards,
under command of Captain Fletcher, were
ordered to report at the jail this afternoon.
Sentries have been placed at all avenues
leading to the jail, and no one is allowed to
pass inside the lines. Nothing authentic
concerning the movements of the Decatur
mob can be ascertained. It is known, however
, that the men composing it are intelligent
and belong to the best class of citizenship
. The Madison county jail, in
which the negroes are confined is almost
impregnable, except on the immediate
front. It is guarded by a twelve- foot fence,
which can be broken by nothing less than
a battering ram. A dozen brave men could
hold the jail against a regiment. The Bir-
mingham Rifles have been ordered here to
reinforce the local militia. They are now
en route on a special train.
The Chamber of Commerce and county
officials, together with the local ministry,
held meetings to- night and passed resolutions
deploring the terrible crime committed
by Thompson and Neville at Decatur,
condemning lynch law and commending the
sheriff for protecting the from
summary vengeance. negroes

THE AIKEN LYNCHING LYNCHING AIKEN
A Hopeful Development Hopeful Development
(From the Greenville News) From the Greenville News)
The good citizenship of South
Carolina is deeply gratified over the
statement from the Governor's of-
fice that the hand of the law is clos-
ing in upon the mob that lynched
three Negroes at Aiken last month.
If Governor McLeod is able to
bring this law enforcement
effort
to a successful
culmination, his
closing days in the office of chief
magistrate will be marked by a very
notable service for his State
and
his nation. The Governor is to be
congratulated and commended upon
the earnest effets he has made in
connection with this affair, for it
is generally known that he has been
laboring against certain elements of
indifference and possibly some an-
tagonism in his efforts to bring the
guilty parti to justice.
Up u the Aiken affair, South
Carolina ad a notably clean record
during the last several years so far
as lynchings are concerned. There
had been no excuse whatever dur-
ing that period for any pointing of
the finger of scorn at South Caro-
lina as a sympathizer with or con-
doner of mob violence. And if the
Adequate
persons guilty in the Aiken tragedy
are brought to the bar of justice and
proper penalties imposed, our record
as a State will continue to be kept
clean.
punishment for
this crime will be a factor of incal-
culable value in sustaining the ma-
jesty of the law in this State and
in preventing future occurrences of
this kind. Let the State demonstrate
that it will not tolerate affairs of
this kind, and they will cease to oc-
It is of the utmost importance
to the good name of South Carolina
and to the preservation of law and
order and the established machinery
of justice that the perpetrators of
this deed be placed behind the bars.
South Carolina is watching these
developments, as indicated in the
statement from the Governor's of-
fice, with an intense hope. A defi-
nite announcement that the alleged
lynchers had beer. arrested and

would be brought to trial at an
early date would be a cause of great
rejoicing among the vast majority
of the citizens of this State. Let
us hope that such an announcement
will be soon forthcoming.
*Uneasy Lies the Head"
(From the Columbia State)
The morning after the butchery
of the three Lowmans, it is quite
probable that all the participants
in the lynching felt as "right as
rain." Being of the mental and
moral class that can plan murder
without compunction, their conse-
quences did not trouble them. In
the first place they had decreed
themselves the right to determine
what is justice as well as the power
to execute it-laws, courts and civil-
ization to the contrary notwithstand-
ing. In the second place they were
only proceeding against "niggers."
without friends or influence.

It is quite possible, too, that they
figured just how an investigation
would be begun and quickly drop-
ped; just how a coroner's jury
would function and, without seek-
ing below the surface or beyond the
obvious, find its stereotyped inane
verdict. The lynchers had a line
on what would be done; they knew
in advance, or thought they kneÂ¹v.
just what the local power that be
would say and do.
So, having no trouble outside of
possible detection, they felt safe.
There would be no serious investiga-
tion; nothing but a mere fraudulent
form, and then the crime would be
forgotten. Occasionally a lyncher
might be disturbed by dreams; bc-
casionally a woman's screams, ut-
tered in mortal terror, would awak-
en one of the least hardened from
his slumbers, but the majority of
them would argue themselves into
the belief they were public bene-
factors, and even lay claim to such
distinction quietly, of course.
But somehow there has been a
miscarriage of plans. The white-
wash over the black smudge didn't
stick. It scaled off. And here, six
weeks after the crime, the black-
ness of it is as distinct as ever.
Worse stil, there are plain indica-
tions the lynchers are in actual dan-
ger. The rules of the game have
not been observed. "Local self-gov-
ernment" has not been permitted to
function. Word comes from the
Governor of the State that
evidence
is being gathered, and that more
may be expected! And if one on
this morning after Thanksgiving
is in pessimistic mood and would
quickly become thankful, let him
imagine himself in the role of one
of those Aiken County lynchers.

Action at Last
(From the Spartanburg Herald)
That the climax in the investiga-
tion into the lynching at Aiken is
near is an announcement for which
South Carolina and the country at
large have waited more or less pa-
tiently for several weeks.

Much
Governor McLeod's announcement
in connection with the case contains
the information that evidence has
been obtained against some of the
alleged participants. This evidence,
it is added. is not based upon the
testimony of persons who occupied
cells in the Aiken County jail on
the night of the

papers concerning allegations at-
tributed to prisoners who claimed
to have known somet' ing about the
lynching of the three Lowmans.
Those who want the guilty persons
punished, however, will be gratified
to learn that the State will not be
compelled to rely upo.. testimony
of such witnesses. No matter how
true such testimony might be, the
fact remains that juries are prone
to discount evidence of this kind.
If Governor McLeod's investigations
have unearthed testimony that will
carry more weight, conviction of the
guilty persons inay be obtained.
Actual arrests in the Aiken case
may be expected within a week to
ten days, the Chief Executive stated.
Governor-elect John G. Richards,
will assume office on January 18,
but there will be no "passing of the
buck," according to the present oc-
cupant of the Governor's chair. Govi
ernor McLeod declared that he will
launch the proceedings against the
alleged lynchers. Long trials, how-

ever, would prevent the case from
being completed before
cessor takes office. Mr.
judging from utterances attributed
to him, will take up the case at the
point it is relinquished by Governor
McLeod, and the people of South
Carolina believe that the matter
will not rest until the Lowmans are
avenged.
The State has been slow in bring-
ing the lynchers to juce, but the
delay will be forgotten if the guilty
eventually are punished. Those who
questioned the majesty of the State
may yet learn that while justice
may not be swift, she is implacable.
South Carolina may have been dila-
tory, but she has not forgotten.

Sheriff Striving to Save a Prisoner
From Infuriated Farmers.
WICHITA, Kans., Feb. 20.- Sheriff Gano
of Medicine Lodge has fled to Anthony
with Professor Hamlin to prevent him
from being lynched. Hamlin, a county
school teacher, 22 years old, is charged
with attacking a girl 9 years old, who
had been going to school with him from
the house at which he boarded. Her
name is Greaver and her people are influential
. It is said that a mob organized
among the Barber County farmers may
follow Hamlin, in which event they will
surely get him, as the Harper County
is a weak concern. Jail

30.- Senator
Madison, Wis., July
Benjamin It. Tillman, of South Caro-
lina, matched his wit and sarcasm
legal mind and western
against the
manners of Senator J. R. Burton, of
Kansas, here in a joint debate on the
negro question. Senator Tillman said
the people of the north were as bad as
those of the south in their handling of
the negroes.
" When a negro up here shows the
outcroppings of the inst nets of his inferior
race." said Mr. Tillman," you
mob, string, lynch, burn and outrage
humanity with him. It makes a mighty
tig difference whose family is struck,
whose home is entered, whose wife or
daughter is the victim. You men of
the north are not slow to act when your
women are outraged, and I want to say
you are men to do it. If you had as
many' niggers' as we do in South Caro-
lina you would feel as I do, and your
would sustain your' anti- nigger'
people senators as my people sustain me."

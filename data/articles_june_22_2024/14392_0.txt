A TRIO.
Three Negro Highway Lynched in
Texas.
Jefferson, Tex., November 15.- Three ne-
groes who had been arrested by Sheriff
Haywood for waylaying and attempting to
kill Mr. Stallcup, were taken from the jail
last night by unknown parties and hanged
to the railroad bridge across Cypress
bayou. The negroes had confessed to the
crime. The mob that did the hanging overpowered
the jailer and cut the telephone
line that the jailer could not communicate
so with the sheriff.

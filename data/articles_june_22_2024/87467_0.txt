RUMOR BREAKS UP A MEETING.
Report That a Lynching Is About to
Occur Stampedes a Colored
Gathering.
Considerable excitement was created in
Kansas City, Kas .. last evening over a rumor
of a proposed lynching. The rumor
was started as a joke, but it had the same
effect as if it had been authentic. John
McAfee, a young colored man, who was
arrested in the afternoon for improper
conduct, was locked up at police headquarters
pending an investigation. Last night
there was a big colored political meeting
in progress on Minnesota avenue, and the
word was quietly passed around that a
Imob was organizing to lynch McAfee. This
broke up the meeting and caused a small
stampede. The colored people rushed to
the city hall in large numbers, ready to
take up arms against" Judge Lynch. It
was not necessary, however, as there was
no mob gathering, nor had anyone
of attempting to lynch McAfee. thought

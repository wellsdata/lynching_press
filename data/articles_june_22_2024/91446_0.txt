With Death By
of Rioters. Bands

TO CALL MILITIA
Lynchers Are Thwarted As
Sheriff Hides Charge In
Nearby Town.
Lima, O., Aug. 31.- After a night of
violence resulting from the attempt of
a mob to lynch Charles Daniels, a negro
, accused of assaulting Mrs. John
Babor, wife of a prominent farmer:
the spiriting away of the prisoner by
Sheriff Sherman Eley; and the torture
of the sheriff until he consented
to lead the mob in motors to Ottawa,
where he had taken the man, the law
apparently reigned again today.
Daniels, the prisoner, whose life was
saved by the quick action of the sheriff
, is in a safe place- Toledo, it is un.
derstood- and J. P. Laser, prosecutor
of Allen county, is taking the preliminary
steps of investigation into the
affair.
Governor Willis, after a night spent
in his office at Columbus with Adjutant
General B. W. Hough, was prepared
today to order the First and
Seventh regiments of Ohio National
Guard from Camp Perry to this city
in case the trouble is revived. After
the unsuccessful pursuit of Daniels in
a motor procession to Ottawa last
night, members of the mob had dispersed
, it is believed, since the procession
as a unit has not returned to
this city.
Sheriff Eley escaped from the mob
at Ottawa and is nnder the care of a
physician. He is suffering, it is understood
, from two broken ribs and
numerous minor injuries.
Following the capture of the negro
by a posse yesterday, after Mrs. Pabor
had been attacked in her home, the
mob spirit begun to develop through-
out the countryside. Eley expected
trouble and quietly removed the prisoner
to Ottawa. He was later transferred
to another place. While the
sheriff was out of the city the mob
stormed the jail, forced the sheriff's
wife to open the cells, overpowered
the once and held the city at its
mercy. Sheriff Eley returned last
night and the mob demanded that he
tell them where he had hidden Dan-
iels.
When the sheriff refused, the crowd
turned their wrath upon him. He es-
caued from his h me but was captured
at the Elks' Home. A rope was
secured from a street trolley and a
noose was placed around Eley's neck.
He was told he would be hanged if he
did not tell where his prisoner was
and the mob tore his clothing from-
his body and kicked and beat him.
Chief of Police McKinney was helpless
and attempted to deputize citi-
zens to aid him in rescuing the sher-
inff but the refused to the
men oppose
mob. Eley finally surrendered to escape
death and the mob entered automobiles
and started with the sheriff as
a prisoner, for Ottawa, just as the fire
department was called out. The chemical
truck was run through the streets
to disperce the mob on foot.
When the motor mob reached Ot-
tawa they found their prisoner gone
and during the confusion Sheriff Eley
escaped. During the remainder of the
night
was momentarily expected
it
that mob would re- form in Lima
upon the the return of the motor party.

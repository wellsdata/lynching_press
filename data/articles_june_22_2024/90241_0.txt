ST. LOUIS, Mo.- While the nation
awaits the action of state authorities
in bringing the leaders of
the mob who lynched Cleo Wright
at Sikeston to justice, a new national
slogan has been suggested. It is
" Remember Pear! Harbor and
Sikeston, Missouri!"
The NAACP said this week that
the southeast section of Missouri
where Sikeston is situated is the
least mechanized section of the
state agriculturally, which means
that the area is relatively poor and
backward. Sikeston and nearby
Carruthersville have some small
industries.
Violence is not new to the
people of the region, as indicated
by two attacks on members of the
Southern Tenant Farmers Union
which occurred in January, the
NAACP stated. On January 16 a
meeting of the union, which includes
Negro and white members, was
broken up and union organizers
driven out of town. Governor For-
rest C. Donnell was called upon to
protect the organizers
On January 24 a second. meeting
was held and this likewise was interfered
with, but through the intercession
of governor the or-
Banizers were the protected by local
police and safely conducted from
town. Subsequently, Negro union
were assaulted and another
members unidentified Negro was shot at.

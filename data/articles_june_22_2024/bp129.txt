LYNCH GUILT: WHOSE IS IT? WHOSE IT? IS GUILT:
THE QUESTION OF who is gulity for the lynch-
ings of Negroes is without end and cannot be answer-
ed. It is depressing to realize the enormous complexi-
ty of the race problem in the South and the innumer-
able factors contributing toward it.
Who was really guilty? No-
body? Not the perpetrators, be-
cause they did not know what
they were doing?
Not the liberal Southerners,
because they progressed cauti-
ously, but nevertheless progres-
sed
Not the Government, because
it had to balance good against
evil and could achieve so much
in other fields, even at the cost
of the dead?
Or was the word "guilt" writ-
ten in capital letters all over
the South, all over the enorm-
ous area of the United States,
all over the whole of the white
race? Again I would like to let
a poet take the floor, a poet
who knew more about it. Ken-

NICE DAY FOR A LYNCHING
The bloodhounds look like
sad old judges
In a strange court. They
point their noses
At the Negro jerking in the
tight noose;
His feet spread crow-like
above these
Honourable men who laugh
as he chokes.
I don't know this black man,
I don't know these white
men.
But I know that one of my
hands
Is black, and one white. I
know that
One part of me is being
strangled,
While another part horribly
laughs.
Until it changes,
I shall be
be killed.
killing; and
The excellent work of the
NAACP, of the Urban League
and of the Commission for In-
terracial Cooperation, which so
clearly indicated a way out of
the chaos of hatred and false
passions, remained hampered
by one great drawback: it met
with hardly any response from
the great Negro masses for
whom it was intended.
NO QUESTION
It reached certain groups of
intellectuals and well-to-do citi-
zens, but there was no question
of a popular movement. At this
point the story must be told of
the only man who succeeded in
exercising an enormous influ-
ence on the American Negro,
the strange and tragic story of
Marcus Garvey.
He was born in Jamaica ´in
1887, where (unlike America).
there was a sharp division be-
tween the rich mulattoes and
the pure Negroes, and he grew
up strongly conscious of his
color and of the fact that he be-
longed to the lowest level of so-
ciety.
These two elements explained
most of his career. A certain
amount of vagueness exists
about his youth and, like many
other famous people, he has
added much to the establish-
ment of a legend about himself.
In any case, he became a
printer's apprentice, and as a
young man he became a fore-
man during a strike. Mean-
while, he dreamed great dreams
for the future of his people-that
is to say, for all the Negroes
of the world.
FOUND BOOK
He visited England in 1912
where he met Negroes from
many countries. He found a
book in a library which was to
change his whole outlook-Book-
er T. Washington's autobio-
graphy, "Up from Slavery."
He found his calling in this
book-to build up the Negro
people economically, to make
them strong from within and
with himself as the leader in
this tremendous task.
But the result was certainly
not what Booker T. had envis-
aged; once again history took
one of those side turnings which
make it so strange and so ab.
sorbing.
Garvey went back to Jamaica
full of great plans to unite all
the Negro peoples of the world
into one large family and thus
to establish a country and gov.
ernment of their own.
On August 1, 1914, he founded
an organization entitled Uni-
versal Negro Improvement As-
sociation, the UNIA, and with
the program set out on many
sheets of paper, but mainly in
his head, he landed in New
York in 1916 and started to
preach his new evangelism.
He could hardly have arrived
at a better time. The great mi-
gration to the North had start-
ed, while the tension between
black and white was growing
steadily as a result of the revi-.
val of the Ku Klux Klan and
of the growing urge among the
Negroes to protest.
During the years 1918. and
1919, the numbers of lynchings
and riots continually increased.
In the midst of all this, --Gar-
vey began to preach his Negro
nationalism and social ideals to
the crowded masses in the
towns.
His success was tremendous.
This squat little man from Ja-
maica achieved within a few
years what neither Washington
nor DuBois, the NAACP nor
any other association had come
remotely near to achieving.
He touched the tender heart-
strings of the masses and they
flocked to him, the thousands
who wanted to hear that their
color was nothing to be asham-
ed of, but that it was their glory
and their fortune and their fu-
ture. Garvey was soon able to
establish the headquarters of his
UNIA, in New York, and
branches were opened through-
out the country.
When a dismissed servant at-
tempted to kill the leader in
1919, the publicity was so enorm.
ous that the numbers of
followers rose to many hun-
dreds of thousands and, accord.
ing to Garvey himself, even
to millions.
NEW WORLD
.
A newspaper was founded,
called the Negro World. This
became a great success, despite
the fact that it categorically
refused to insert advertisements
offering preparations for the
straightening of the hair or the
bleaching of the skin.
The average Negro press had
to exist, and often still exists,
on such advertisements, but
this was beneath the national
dignity with which Garvey was
trying to imbue his people.
The essence of his preaching
was certainly no trifling mat-
ter, consisting primarily of the
insistence on the union of all
the Negroes in the world with-
in the mother country, Africa.
The old idea of returning to
Africa became the absolute core
of Garvey's evangelism; the
idea which Jefferson had
thought about and which the
American Colonization Society
had promoted in vain during the
first half of nineteenth century;
the idea ith which Lincoln
had toyed and which Bishop
Turner had taken up again un-
successfully after the Civil
War.
GREATEST TRIUMPHS
In any event, it was not solely
an idea of the past; during the
same years in which Garvey
achieved his greatest triumphs.
DuBois was holding his Pan-
Africa Congresses (in 1919, 1921,
1923 and 1927).
However, the great difference
was that DuBois did not want
to return to Africa, but only to
provide help for the Negroes
there, while Garvey exclaimed:
"To win Africa, we will give
up America." The work of both
men failed, and. DuBois admit-
¡ted in 1927 that if was “a rather
empty gesture to keep the idea
alive."
How much of Garvey's dream
was realized we will see later.
The two most important lead-
ers of the Negroes in America
became arch-enemies.
However, this could hardly
have been otherwise, with the
thorough and cool intellectual
versus the passionate dema-
gogue. Garvey called DuBois a
"conceited pedant, a lazy, de-
pendent mulatto," and DuBois
gave warnings against Garvey's
fantasies in every issue of Cris-
is.
FANTASTIC AFFAIRS
The affairs which Garvey or-
ganized certainly were fantas-
tic. Some were harmless
enough, such as the proclama-
tion of an Africa Empire with
himself at the head, or the ap-
pointment of some of his follow.
ers to Dukedoms of the Nile or
the Niger.
(In this connection I would
like to quote Presser's footnote:
"Before one laughs at these
names, one should recalled the
Prince of the Moskwa and the
King of Rome.") Furthermore,
there was the founding of an
"African Legion" and a "Black
Legion" and a "Black Cross'
and of an "African Orthodox
Church," in which a black God,
Jesus and Mary were worship-
ed.
This too could easily be
ridiculed, but was it really so
strange? An old woman in Har-
lem came to the Bishop of the
new Church and told him that at
last she was happy.
Until that time she had not
believed in anything, for she
knew “that no white man would
ever die on the cross for me."

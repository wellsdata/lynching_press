Ed Johnson, colored, was taken from
jail at Chattanooga, Tenn., Monday
night by a mob of seventy- five men
and hanged to a beam of the county
bridge over the Tennessee river. The
negro was to have been hanged Tues-
day morning, but the United States
court granted a stay of execution
supreme and this angered the citizens.

Indignation Meeting.
An indignation meeting, relative to the acquitty
tal of DR. THOMPSON, was held in Lewisburg
last week, at which the following, among other,
resolutions were adopted:
Resolved, That we believe the jury either perjured
or incompetent.
Resolved, That the murderer and the jury are
alike to be shunned by all justice loving men
every where.
Resolved, That it is time when the laws fail,
as in this case, to protect the sacredness of persons
and the sancity of virtue, that we should
appeal to the last resort of Human Justice-
Lynch law:
Resolved, That it will be the stern duty of
any community, into which Dr. Thompson should
come, to immediately Lynch him.

of Lewisburg, will Lynch him.

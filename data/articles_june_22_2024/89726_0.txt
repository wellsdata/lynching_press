A Murder and Lynching.
Last week Thursday night in San
Miguel county, near Las Vegas, a sheep
owner named Benigno Martinez and
his herder, Juan Gallego, were killed
while asleep, their heels tied together
and thrown over the back of a burro,
which dragged them all night. A train
of circumstantial evidence was clear
and a man named Cecilio Lucero, a
cousin of Martinez committed the
cow-
ardly murder and he was arrested
for the crime. He was arrested
at his
father's house; the father, like those of
ancient Rome, sternly unheld the law
and assisted in arresting and binding
his son. Unlike the Roman father,
however, he appeared at the sheriff's
office the next morning and demanded
his share of the reward offered for the
arrest of his son. On Monday the pre-
liminary examination of Lucero was
held, the evidence against him was
overwhelming. He was taken to the
City prison. At nine o'clock that night
a crowd appeared at the prison after
the murderer; the city marshal made a
resistance, but could do nothing with
the crowd. At 9:50 he was drawn up
over the arm of a telegraph pole and at
10:10 the coroner cut the dead body
down. All honor to the brave and
patriotic men of Las Vegas who so
nobly did their duty. It is hard to
have to commend mob law and lynching
, but in San Miguel county and
Grant county and some other counties
in this territory, it is the only thing
left for honest men. May the duty of
Judge Lynch be done, and the
removed. Lordsburg Liberal .. cause

F>
Psychology" Almost
Killed This Negro
Man Who Signed "Confession"
Finds Out After Conviction
His Alleged Victim Was In
Friend's Home At Time He
Said He Committed Crime.
YORK, March 5- How an
ple from the Danville (VÃ ) Register.
The Register tells how tha Negro,
William Harper, "was arrested, hus-
tled to the third degree room at the
Norfolk police headquarters, given
the works and signed a complete
confession of his crime. admitting all
the details alleged," being then con-
victed by a jury and sentenced to
death.
But thereafter two residents of
Portsmouth came forward "and tes-
tified that at the time the alleged
crime was supposed to have been
committed across the Liizabeth
river in Norfolk, the young woman
was in their home. A man has told
defense attorneys and the common-
wealth's attorney that he had an en-
gagement with the
fong married
woman that night and that shp
could hardly have been lying un-
conscious in Upton's lane at the time
she said she was. As a result of
this testimony. Judge A. R. Hanckel.
in part one of the Corporation Court
of Norfolk. yesterday: granted the
Negro a new trial. He will be ac-
quitted at his retrial."
The Register comments that the
Negro "was about to be made the
victim of a woman's abnormal psy-
chology."
The N. A. A. C. P. cites this case
as one of many such, the victim of
the white woman's "abnormal psy-
chology" being more often lynched
without trial than given belated jus- |
tice in a court of law.

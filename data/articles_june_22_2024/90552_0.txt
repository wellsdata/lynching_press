Omaha, Neb., Sept. 29.- An attempt
to lynch Mayor Ed P. Smith was made
by the mob which later hung William
Brown, negro, to a pole. A rope was
thrown around his neck and he was
pulled off the ground twice before two
police officers succeeded in cutting
the rope and getting him into an automobile
and away from the mob.
William Brown, colored, was dragged
from the county jail and hanged to an
ectric light pole, fololwing a struggle
of nine hours to secure possession
of his body by an immense mob.
A big fire started on the ground
floor of the court house and the entire
fire department was called out. There
were more than 100 prisoners billeted
in the jail, which is on the top floor of
the court house. Immense crowds continued
to gather, making it difficult
for the fire department to reach the
scene or for the police to protect the
firemen in their work. Within ten
minutes after the firemen arrived every
line of hose laid by the firemen
had been cut.
It was learned that one man, Frank
Clancy, aged 20, had been killed and
twenty- four others wounded during the
fighting.
The police and firemen were entirely
at the mercy of the mob, which had
broken into gun and ammunition stores
and supplied themselves with explo.
sives and weapons.
Two hours after Brown had been
hanged to en electric light pole the
firemen were, for the first time, able to
get a stream on the flames. At the
same time, additional extension ladders
were sent to the third and fourth
floors, where many of the occupants
were stonding on window ledges on the
one side of the building that had not
yet been touched by the flames.
The fire, however, had already destroyed
valuable records which can
never be replaced. Aas soon as the
mob had accomplished its prime object
it appeared ready to subside and began
to diminish.
During the rioting a large number of
negroes were badly beaten on the
streets, some of them dangerously injured
. Chief of Police Eberstein was
himself subjected to physical violence
and narrowly escaped great personal
injury when members of the force
charged the crowd and led him to safety
. Thousands of persons congregated
in the downtown district, some of them
out of curiosity, but great numbers
showing decided sympathy for the
would- be lynchers. The sheriff coupled
up three lines of interior fire hose and
with his deputies and some police officers
attempted to cow the crowd by
turning water on them. Instead of hav-
that effect, it brought a hail
stones and bricks. of

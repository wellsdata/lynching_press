THREE NEGROES LYNCHED.
They Had Murdered a Postmaster and His
Assistant.
TALLAHASSEE, Fla., March 16.- Three
negroes, Jim Gilmore, Jim Miley and
Otis Miller, were taken from the sheriff
yesterday by 50 armed men, strung up
to trees and their bodies riddled with
bullets.
The crime for which they were
lynched was the murder of John Bare-
field, postmaster at Blue Springs, and
his assistant, John R. Turner, on March
3. The murder was committed for the
purpose of robbery and was not discovered
until the next morning. Since
that time a posse has been on the track
of the negroes and yesterday they were
captured by the sheriff of Orange
county.
The negroes had been fishing on Lake
Locke when the sheriff came across
them. They showed fight at first but
were quickly overpowered and taken to
Orlando for safekeeping. The negroes
were identified as the murderers, taken
the scene of their crime and
to
lynched. They implicated James Rich-
aardson, colored, in the murders and he
probably be lynched as soon as cap-
will tured.

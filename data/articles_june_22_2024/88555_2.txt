From the New York Evening Post.
Another sheriff- North of St. Clair
county, Ala.- has become distinguished
by doing his duty to save a criminal in
his hands from execution by a mob. A
been guilty of
had" the
negro
usual
crime" upon a young white girl, but he
had been promptly arrested, tried, convicted
and sentenced to be hanged within
a month. There was consequently assurance
that justice was to be done in the
case by the constituted authorities, and
no excuse whatever for any interference
by outsiders. Yet hundreds of people
gathered and attempted to take the prisoner
from the sheriff. He refused to
surrender his charge, and when the mob
resorted to violence the sheriff and his
deputies fired upon them, wounding three
men, one of whom will die, and then re
moving the negro to a place of safety.
This
is a fit response to the protest
against lynch law recently made by ex
Governor Jones in the constitutional convention
of Alabama, and, like the action
of Sheriff Kyle of Tuscaloosa, in the same
State, last week, it indicates that officials
are coming to recognize their duty in
matter. this

NEGRO IS LYNCHED
NEAR NORFOLK, VA
MAN WHO WITNESSES THE CRIME
FROM BEDROOM WINDOW SAYS
IT WAS COMMITTED BY FOUR
MAS. ED MEN.
Norfolk, Va .. October 24.- George W.
Blount a negro proprietor of a fish and
oyster shop in the suberbs of Berkley,
was taken early this morning from the
police station, where he was confined,
by a mob of fifty masked men and lynched
.
Blount had been arrested Saturday
night for striking T. D. Hollman a Berke-
ley policeman in the face with a lighted
lamp, badly burning him. The officer
had gone to Blount's place to arrest another
negro and Blount refused the officer
permission to enter.
W. W. Robertson, a lumber dealer and
a resident of Berkley, told Mayor Allen
of that place today that he witnessed the
killing from his bedroom window, and
that Blount's screams awakened him.
Four masked men, he said, had Blount in
the middle of the street and were clubbing
his head.
Three of the men became frightened at
their victim's cries and fled, but the other,
whom Robertson believes was white, drew
a pistol and shot Blount through the
back of his head. Rear Admiral Harring-
ton, commanding the Norfolk navy, today
directed the marines and sailors at St.
Helena reservation near Berkley to be
in readiness for action in case of a negro
uprising. Col. A. M. Higgins, commanding
the Seventy- first Virginia regiment, National
guards, after a conference with
Mayor Allen today, ordered the Norfolk
companies of the Seventy- first regiment to
Berkley. The negro population of the town
is excited over the lynching of Blount
and serious trouble is feared after nightfall
.
Mayor Allen of Berkley has declared he
will use every effort to apprehend
members of the mob. the

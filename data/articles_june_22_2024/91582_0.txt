With a gravity fitting the event it was announced in
reference to a recent lynching of a negro by a Spring-
field mob that the lynchers were in particularly good
humor, orderly and gay to the limit of jest and joke
during their hideous work. Is it possible to conceive of
a sterner arraignment of a community than this brutally
frank recital of an appalling crime that should be for-
even to imagination in a people bound by the crudest
eign laws of civilization?

INDIANA PROBE
IS A WASHOUT
Lynchers Go Free, And
Sheriff Commended
MARION, Ind.-(ANP)-Into that
classic limbo of forgotten things goes
the vigorous investigation of the lynch-
ing of two Negro boys, Tom Shipp, and
Abe Smith, who were dragged out of
the county jall here early in August
and hung to trees on the courthouse
yard.
The two boys were accused of having
held up a white man and his girl es-
cort on a lonely by-road, known as
"Lover's Lane".
Shortly after they were arrested, ru-
mors became current that a mob was
forming with the avowed intention of
lynching the boys, Word was sent to
Sheriff Campbell of Grant county, in-
forming him of the danger, but noth-
ing was done to prevent the formation
of the mob.
In the evening. 10,000 strong, it at-
tacked the jail. The sheriff refused to
issue any orders to halt the angry
white citizens, standing by while they
broke jall doors and locks and seized
the victims.
Investigation was demanded by sev-
eral agencies, including the National
Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, which made a private
investigation through its secretary,
Walter F. White. Sheriff Campbell was
severely criticized for neglect, but the
fear was expressed that nothing would
be done to him about the lynching be-
cause of the political power of the
sheriff in Grant County.
The county grand jury in its report
last Thursday sustained the fears. It
refused to return indictments against
any of the men against whom charges
had been made, and added a few para-
graphs to its report to commend the
work of the sheriff, who, according to
the grand jury, had prevented a race
riot by permitting the lynching.jall

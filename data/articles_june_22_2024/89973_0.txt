" I returned to the Executive Mansion
at 6 o'clock in the morning and was just
getting off my horse when a messenger
notified me that a mob was breaking
down the doors of the jail, bent on hanging
one of the negro men whom we had
locked up on suspicion. I got there as
quickly as I could, running my horse at
top speed. mob had the negro and
was dragging The him into the street.

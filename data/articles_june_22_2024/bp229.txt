Dadeville, Ala.
Lynching Feared
(Defender New York Bureau) Defender New York Bureau)
NEW YORK-Immediate federal
action to prevent the threatened
lynching of Australia Farrow, a
Negro veteran, in Dadeville, Ala,
was demanded by the United Ne-
aro and Allied Veterans of Amer-
ica.
The Negro section of that south-
ern town was the scene of the fa-
tal shooting, of Mrs. Mary L. Mat-
thews, a pregnant mother of three
on May 4 by Albert Hucy, a white
mill worker, UNAVA disclosed
last week as they called on Atty.
Gen. Tom Clark to intervene in a
case of "gross violations of the
civil rights of a veteran of World
War II. Farrow is at present held
in the county jail in Camp Hill,
Ala, after confessing that he hit
Huey on the head with a stick be-
fore the shooting occurred, while
the latter is out on bail.
According to the veterans' group
the murder of Mrs. Matthews cul-
minated a series of violations of
the civil rights of Negro citizens
in the Camp Hill community fal-
lowing an altercation between
Huey and Farrow. Huey was ar-
rested and released on a $1,000
bail. No action was taken by local
police there to gather evidence in
the murder of Mrs. Matthews.
At their convention which closed
last week here members of
UNAVA vigorously demanded the
immediate prosecution under fed-
eral statutes of Hucy for the mur-
der of Mrs. Matthews. They irged
all organizations in the country to
join in a nation-wide campaign to
prevent the lynching of Farrow
and to exact justice for the mur-
der of the expectant mother.

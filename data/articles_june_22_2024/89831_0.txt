MOB HANGS LEO FRANK
MARIETTA, Aug. 17.- Leo Frank
convicted of the murder of Mary
Ph√°gan, was taken from the state
prison farm at Milledgeville last
night by a small band of determined
men, brought to within a few miles
of the Phagan home here at daybreak
, and hanged to a tree on the
Milledgeville highway. The body,
found at eight o'clock this morning,
dangled from the tree several hours
while a throng from the surrounding
countryside gathered at the scene.
By a vote of the crowd, the body was
cut down without mutilation, and
taken in an automobile to Atlanta,
where another throng congregated to
view it.
While the identity of no member
of the band was known to the officials
tonight, it was suggested that
the fact that Frank was taken nearly
one hundred miles in an automobile
from the prison almost to the
outskirts of Marietta, would indicate
that most of the lynchers came
that city. from

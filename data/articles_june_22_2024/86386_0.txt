Houston, Sept. 16.- A Post special
from Centerville, Miss., says: William
Williams, a negro, was lynched on Main
street of Centerville by a mob of several
hundred people. Williams, who
was a laboring agent, has been here
several days employing negroes for
contractors in other sections of the
state. It is alleged that he enticed several
employes of the Robinson Mercantile
company to leave that concern,
and James H. Germany, a white emn-
ploye of the Robinson company, met
him on the street and
remonstrated
with him about his conduct. A quarrel
followed and Williams drew a revolver
and shot Germany dead.
The negro attempted to escape after
killing Germany, but a mob was quickly
on his heels and a running fight
followed, which ended in the negro being
captured and shot to death by
crowd. the

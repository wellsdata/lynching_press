A. W. Billingslea was standing in front
of a cigar store on Fifteenth, Christian

Billingslea sought to introduce

character of Specht and his wife.
Specht swears he will kill the agent,

composed of leading colored men of the
state, held a meeting to- day and passed

the property he was bound to protect,
thus becoming an accessory to the savage
taking of a prisoner's life who had
been placed in his hands for safe- keeping
and protection." The league pledged
itself to do all in its power to defeat
Boyd, who is a candidate for re-
this fall. election

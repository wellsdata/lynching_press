Lynch Law In Oklahoma
Four ranch owners and cattlemen,
all white and all well- to- do, were taken
out of a jail at Ada, Okla., and lynched.
They were lynched because of many
high- handed crimes in the past and for
the murder recently of Deputy United
States Marshal Bobbitt.
The four victims of the mob led a
gang of rough and desperate men, who
terrorized their section of their country
. No one had been able to bring
them to punishment until Bobbitt
rounded them up.
Lynch law is indefensible in any
case or in any locality, but it is refreshing
to find an application of it to
some one beside the weak and helpless
. The subjects of the mob's fury
were, however, helpless in the jail
from which they were taken. If
had been on their ranches circum- they
stances would have been reversed. A
mob rarely encounters any risks. It
assails those who cannot strike back.
It is everywhere cowardly, and the
Oklahoma case was no exception to
the rule.
Now and then it gets a dose of punishment
itself. Such a case occurred
in Birmingham, and no attempt at
lynching has since been known in this
city. But such cases are rare. As a
rule a mob no risks. As a rule
its victims are takes helpless.

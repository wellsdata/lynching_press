Special dispatches from Springfield,
Illinois, of the 15th, tell of a tragic
state of affairs in that effete metropolis
, resulting from a race riot which
began there the night previous.
Two white men were killed, one fatally
wounded and one negro lynched
and more than half a hundred persons
injured and two score of houses, most-
ly occupied by negroes, burned to the
ground, as a result of a negro brute
dragging a white lady from her home
into her garden and committing criminal
assault.
After a night of riot, arson and
bloodshed, many whites were missing.
and it was known that scores of ne-
groes had been dragged away wounded
and dying. Early in the morning
there was a slight cessation of rioting
but during the forenoon assumed
an alarming condition.
Negroes swarmed back into the east
end armed and a night of terror
was heavily imminent. Officers and mili
tia were rowerless. Soldiers had been
taken and their arms appropriated to
the use of the mob. Whites are com
ng in from nearby towns to help inside
the race war, and thousands of men
are swarming the streets The whole

was hanged on the public square by a
mob and his body riddled with bullets.

has been restored and the 4200 troops
on the ground claim to have the ritua-
tion well in hand, yet renewed
breaks are constantly looked for. out

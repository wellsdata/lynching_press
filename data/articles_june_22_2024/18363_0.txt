Negro Lynching Brings on Qulte a
Breeze.
London, June 18.- There
was a
large and enthusiastic gathering at
a meeting today in the City Temple of
the British Woman's
Temperance
association.
Miss Florence Balgarnie accused
Miss Frances E. Willard, president
of the W. C. T. U. of America, of being
an apoligist for lynchings in the
southern part of the United States.
Miss Willard made a spirited defense
of herself and the union.
A resolution was carried unanimously
declaring that the council emphatically
believed the American W. C. T.
U. maintained toward the lynching
question the same attitude as other
Christian bodies, namely that under
no circumstances must human life be
taken without process of law.
Lady Somerset was re- elected president
of the British Woman's Temperance
association.
The meeting at Queens Hall this
evening was large and enthusiastic,
Mrs. Orston Chant presided instead of
Lady Henry Somerset who was in
disposed, from the fatigue of the com
paign.
The Daily News announces the rez
olution adopted by the British Woman's
Temperance association on the
relief of lynching as a mockery and
,
declares that British women will to
day be ashamed that even in an ef
of neighborly feeling they consented
fusion to pass such a resolution.

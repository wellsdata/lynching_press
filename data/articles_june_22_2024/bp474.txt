To Fight Lynching Fight Lynching
To the Editor of The Amsterdam News. the Editor of The Amsterdam News.
Dear Sir-The shocking lynch-
ing of Claude Neal, and even more
distressing act of the mob in ad-
vertising the lynching many hours
in advance, supply final proof, if
such proof were needed, that lynch-
ing can be stopped only if Federal
ald is given to the states as the
Costigan-Wagner Bill provides.
This bill was not acted upon in the
last Senate despite an overwhelm-
ing majority in both houses of
Congress which favored the meas-
ure, because a small number of
senators, who come from states
with the worst lynching records.
blocked action under the unani-
nous consent rule of the Senate.
The National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People for
twenty-five years has worked in-
cessantly to arouse public opinion
against lynching and to secure
effective legislation backed by that
public opinion. The association
and other organizations, with a
total
40,000,000
membership
of
Americans of both races, who la-
bored to secure action during the
last session of Congress, were sore-
ly handicapped because of insuffi-
cient funds for the printing of
enough literature, for telegrams,
postage and traveling expenses of
witnesses at Washington and other
necessary costs.
Supported, as it is, wholly by
memberships and voluntary con-
tributions, the N. A. A. C. P. appeals
to all Americans who want to see
our country's name cleared of the
disgrace of lynching to help us by
sending contributions, of whatever
amount, large or small, the indi-
vidual donor can give to help
finance this important campaign of
public education.
Checks may be made payable to i

Lynch Law Lynched.
The Governor of Tennessee says the
Millington Murderers must be
Brought to Justice and that
Lynching Must be Banished
in his State.
CHATTANOOGA, TENN., Sept. 5. Governor
Turney intends to pnish the members
of the mob who lynched the six
negro alleged incendiaries at Millington
Friday night. The Governor passed
through this city yesterday on his way
to Nashville. In an interview he said:
" The Millington lynchers must be brought
to justice and I will begin with a thorough
investigation at once. I will assist the
Memphis authorities by offering large
rewards and employing detectives to
run down the beasts who committed this
crime against civilization. Such out
rages as this Millington affair would dis
grace any community, and an example
must be made of the savages who composed
the mob. There is no use in talk-
ing about the matter; action is what is
necessary and there will be at once.
Lynchings must be stopped in Tennessee,
if it is in my to do so, and I be-
lieve that it is power."

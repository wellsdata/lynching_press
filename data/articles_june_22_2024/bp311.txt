INVESTIGATE LYNCHING OF
KEGRO VET IN MISSISSIPPI
Bilbo Asks Citizens to Keep Race
Voters From Polls at All Expense
LIBERTY, Miss-A Negro war veteran was lynched here
last August, almost a year ago, because he refused to return to
work as a share cropper on a farm owned by Russ McDowell.
He was fired upon while driv-
ing in a truck along a nearby
highway here and then attacked
by three identified white men. His
head was bashed in. A relative
driving with him was cruelly
beaten and left for "dead".
Sheriff Wiley Smith reported
that the slayers were exonerated
of all charges in court.
This was the testimony of Hil-
tcn Lea, 27, relative of Russ Mc-
Dowell, the victim, as he gave de-
tails of the tragedy to NAACP
officials in New Orleans, La. last
week. He was an eye witness to
the crime and himself, severely
beaten.
Attempts to gain information
from the sheriff were fruitless.

in the nearby town of Brandon.

to any means to keep
to keep Negroes
from the polls July 2."
"And," he added, "if you don't
know what that means you are
not on persuasive measures.
"The white people of Mississippi
are sleeping on a volcano, and it
is left up to you red-blooded men
to do something about it. The
white men of this state have a
right to resort to any means at
tneir command to stop it."

mostly in cities, were said to have
been qualified to participate in the

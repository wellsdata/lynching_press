A FIEND ESCAPES LYNCHING.

her seven years ago, soon after the death
of her mother and has forced her to submit
to his lust ever since. Yesterday she refused
to continue their relations longer and
he assaulted her iu a savage manner. She
made complaint and the revolting story
came out. Perry was arrested, but escaped

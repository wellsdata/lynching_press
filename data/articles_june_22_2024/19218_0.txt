DOUBLE LYNCHING.
Pass Kirkpatrick Hanged From a Tree and
Her Husband Shot Dead by the Same
Crowd- The Woman Accused of Incendiarism
.
GALLATIN, TENN., April 19.- One of the
most sensational tragedies in the history
of this county was enacted last night,
about twelve o'clock, a few miles from
town. It was the lynching of a negro
woman named Puss Kirkpatrick, and
the shooting fatally of her husband
Isaac. The woman was charged
Jim McCollough,
with incendiarism.
while walking along a country road
at an early hour, saw some distance ahead
what he supposed to be a woman in her
night- dress hiding behind a tree, and in his
close scrutiny of so unusual a sight he almost
stumbled over the body of Isaac
Kirkpatrick, the husband, lying beside
the road. Upon reaching the tree the
ghastly truth burst upon him. The
, her foot
woman, was hanging dead
almost on the ground. He hurriedly reported
the fact in town. A coroner and
jury of inquest repaired to the spot, re.
porting that the woman came to her death
by strangulation and the husband by a
pistol- shot wound by parties unknown.
The husband was not suspected of complicity
in house- burning, and the theory of
his killing is that he discovered the identity
of some of the lynching party and
was shot to avoid exposure.,

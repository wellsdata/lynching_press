Governor Folk and his staff of
grand jurors made their final report
on the mob of April 14th that
hanged and burned three innocent
Negroes in Springfield, Mo. The
jury found that no attack had been
made on Mrs. Mina Edwards, that
it was impossible for the two Ne-
accused to have been at the
groes
scene at the time stated in the
case, and that the sheriff and the
police were negligent
in the department performance of their duty.

A LADY MURDERED BY HER SERVANT-
The Lynch Law Applied.- Granville Co., N.
, Sept. 18. A fearful tragedy was enacted
some days since near Buchanan, in this county.
Mrs. Parthenia Harris, wife of Haman Harris,
was cruelly murdered by a negro woman, who
formerly belonged to the family, and still resided
with them. Mrs. Harris was found dead in
her yard, her head having been crushed with a
rock so as to beat out her brains.
The woman was arrested on suspicion, confessed
the deed, and the neighbors executed
summary punishment upon her by hanging her
to a tree. N cause was assigned for the act.
The freed negroes here, as elsewhere, are fast
becoming vagrants, continuously changing from
place to place, and but little or no reliance can
be placed upon any contract they make as
labor. Cor. of Petersburg Index. to

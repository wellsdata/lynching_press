FOR LEESBURG LYNCHING.
Two Men Arrested- Governor Orders
Thorough Investigation.
LEESBURG, Va., Aug. 4.- Two men are
under arrest in connection with the lynching
here Thursday afternoon of Charles
Craven, the alleged murderer of W. H.
Wilson, an aged farmer of Loudoun county.
Gov. Montague has ordered a thorough
investigation of the lynching and it is
believed that several of the men, against
whom testimony has been given at the
inquest, will be held for the Grand Jury.
In the event of this result of the investigation
, the guards at the Leesburg jail would
be augmented, as it is confidently expected
that the members of the mob who lynched
Craven would attempt a jail delivery.
The Grand Jury will meet Monday and
indictments will probably be returned
against ten or more residents of Fairfax
county, charging them having taken an
active part in leading the with mob of lynchers.

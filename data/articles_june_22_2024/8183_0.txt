Reward for White Caps.
Governor Gordon of Georgia has offered
a reward for the arrest of another
party of White Caps, whose victim was a
negro. The offense was committed in
Mitchell County. Reuben Mitchell, a
negro, was killed in the house of Willis
Bird, on the plantation of Mr. B. A. Cul-
pepper. The deceased was in Willis
Bird's kitchen a house separate from his
,
dwelling, when some unknown parties
called:" Is Reuben Mitchell in there?"
Mitchell immediately ran out and was
pursued by three white men, into
the house of Bird, in which there was
scarcely any light. Bird was in the house,
but could not identify the parties. It is
said there were three other white men in
the yard at the time of the killing. The
parties, following Mitchell into the house,
shot him with a pistol, the ball entering
near the nipple and lodging under the
skin on the backbone. A jury summoned
by Coroner J. T. Owen rendered a verdict
that the deceased came to his death
by a pistol shot from the hands of
unknown. parties

NORTHERN MALTREATMENT OF THE
NEGRO.
It generally happens that when
a negro committs the crime of rape
on a white woman in the South,
Southern men lynch him. The
best sentiment in the South is op-
to lynching and many
posed
Southern newspapers, including
The Post advocate a special term
of court, to try rape cases immed-
iately upon the commission of the
erime.
ig-
Many Northern newspapers,
noring this attitute on the part of
many Southern newspapers and
the best citizens of the South ignoring
the great provocation from
the crime, and saying not one
condemnation of the
word in
criminal or in sympathy with the
victim, have chosen to denounce
the South for the lynchings which
have occurred within its borders.
By many Northern journalists, the
negro who is lynched for raping a
white woman is regarded as a martyr
and is put upon a level with
the holy men of history, the saints
who died for the Christian faith,
that the
forgetting altogether
Christian religion forbids rape,
and that the heinous crime is ren-
dered a thousandfold more heinous
by the unnaturalness of miscegenation
of the races.
With the men of the North this
misdirected pro- negro zeal is not
So genuine as the zealots believe it.
Although many of them know it
not, it is nothing more nor less
than sectionalism and predjudice
against the South. If the wife,
sister or daughter of one of these
Northern partisans were raped by
a negro, which God forbid, it is
very likely that the husband,
brother or father of the victim
would find the blood boiling in his
veins not very differently from the
Southern way, and he would lynch
the black fiend quite as readily as
does his fellow countrymen at the
South.
We get the chance every now
and then, as with the Colorado and
Kansas lynchings, which happened
not a great while ago, to reply to
our Northern critics with unan-
swerable facts. The recent race
wars in Adams county, Indiana,
and at Eldorado, Illinois, demonstrate
that not only is it true, as the
Colorado and Kansas lynchings
that is lynched at
a negro
prove,
the North for a heinous crime, but
and driven
that he is persecuted
out of the country for no crime at
all, and that there is a predjudice
at the North against poor negro's
peacably earning an honest living.
As we at the South are more civ-
soilized than this and give the law-
abiding negro a fair chance and
help him all we can, we have the
right to protest against this North-
barbarism. There is no need
ern
to answer the Northern critics of
the South. They are answered by
the facts with an eloquence and
effectiveness which no tongue or
command Let them busy
pen can.
themselves with the beam in their
own eye and try to teach their
people not to maltreat the negro.
The South is strong enough to
stand Northern denunciation,
which is unjust and undeserved,
but the negro inhabitants of Indi-
ana and Illinois should be saved in
some way from Northern
and violence.- Houston Post barbarity.

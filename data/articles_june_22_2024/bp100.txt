work, the editørship of
"The Guardian” in Boston.
Trotter began IM-
mediately to mount an
almost weekly editorial at-
tack on Washington in the
Guardian questioning his
person, prestige and racial
policies. It was inevitable
that the two men, so op-
posite in their views, would
eventually meet and when
they did it was to be re-
corded as the "Boston
Riot". The site was
Columbus
Boston's
Avenue African Methodist
Episcopal Church and the
occasion was an address
by Washington on July 30,
1903, at the invitation of
the Boston branch of the
.
National Negro Business
League. In preparation for
the event, the editors of the
Guardian drafted a series
of nine highly provocative
questions which Trotter
would ask from the floor.
The questions went to the
heart of the nature of the
kind of leadership Wash-
ington was giving to black
people.
The
church
was
crowded with 2,000 people.
The first time a Guardian
supporter attempted to
make himself heard, he
was ejected. When he re-
turned, after Washington
had been introduced, and
attempted to speak again,"
the programs moderator
ordered the police to arrest
him. As he was being
taken, the crowd exploded,
scuffles and fist fights
broke out and in the midst
of it all, Trotter climbed
onto a chair and attempted
to read his questions, but
in the confusion could not
be heard.

established, and this was
to prove more important
than the longevity of any

The most prominent
black newspaper of the
pre-Civil War period was
the "North Star," founded
and edited by Frederick
Douglass, one of the
towering figures in black
history. it was first
published in Rochester,
New York on November 1,
1847, and named - "North

Douglass set forth his
credo:
"The object of the North
Star will be to attack
slavery in all its forms and
aspects, advocate univer-
sal emancipation, exact
the standard of public
morality; promote the
moral and intellectual im-
provement of the colored
people; and to hasten the
day of freedom to our three
million enslaved fellow
countrymen."
The paper's name was
changed in 1851 to
"Frederick Douglass'
to
Paper". as much to
capitalize on the powerful
appeal of his name - by
that time he was widely
known as one of the era's
most notable orators - as it
was, according
Douglass, to distinguish it
from the many other
papers that had "Star" in
their names. In the pages
of the paper, Douglass
brought the same fire to
the printed word as he did
to the spoken word as wit-
ness an excerpt from an
editorial (March 17, 1848)
in which Douglass tem-
porarily turned his at-
tention from slavery to the
War with Mexico. The war
ended with the United
States in possession of
much of that country's
territory. Perhaps he saw
in that war against a weak
neighbor, the same in-
sensitivity which charac-
terized America's dealings
with her own people of
color. He wrote:
"In our judgment, those

After the death of Wash-
ington and the end of the
feud, the remaining career
of Trotter seems strangely
anti-climatic, as if the fire
had gone out. There were
flashes of the old Trotter

whose actions fathered lat-

"Trotter laid the first stone
of the modern protest
movement," asserted Ben-
nett. To be sure, Trotter's
approach to the press set a
pattern that other black ed-
itors were to follow in the
years ahead. With Trotter,
a new militancy appeared
in the black press and it
could not have been de-
veloped at a more prop-
itious time in the history of
black America.
If there ever was a low
point in the history of the
blacks as free citizens in
America, this was it. The
overwhelming majority of
blacks still lived in the
South where a carefully
constructed, dehumanizing
and odious system in Jim
Crow permeated almost
every aspect of their lives.

World War served as its
initial testing ground.
There was a basic con-
tradiction in America's par-
ticipation in an overseas
war to save democracy
while at the same time
black people were subjec-
ted to intolerable treatment
at home. When this issue
was first raised in the
black press there were for-
ces in the government who
viewed such heresy as

their voice will be heard.
This latter point is ex-
tremely important because
even if the majority press
wanted to expand its
coverage of black: affairs -
which is doubtful - there is
a limit beyond which it
logically cannot go. It is
questionable whether its
general readership - which
is predominantly white
would tolerate such
policy. Currently, the
general press is eviden-
cing a declining interest in
black affairs, an attitude in-
duced no doubt by the ab-
sence of demonstrations,
confrontations and other
manifestations of conflict
which were regarded as
newsworthy by the media a
few short years ago. Ad-
ditionally, while there has
been some improvement in
the number of blacks em-
ployed in the general
media, the percentage is
distressingly low and few
are in decision-making
positions.
What blacks expect from
the white press was suc-

published in 1968 by the
Metropolitan Applied Re-
search Center.
"When tentative white
committment is tested - as
in a time of devastating
disorder like the 1967
Newark and Detroit riots
the white press is likely to
retreat and to identify J
totally with the threatened
white community, which is
its natural alliance."
Finally, the press itself is
shrinking as more and,
more newspapers and
magazines merge or go
out of business. Television
with its instant coverage
has become increasingly
more important
despite its built-in faults of
time constraints and its
penchant for making news
entertaining rather than
this
trek from the South. In a
short space of time, the
black population
in
Chicago had nearly tripled
to 111,000. The Defender
could not, of course, have
done this by itself, but
given the choice of living
in the hell of the South, or
chasing a dream up North,
there is little wonder that
so many people chose to
chase the dream.
At its peak, in 1917, the
Defender was selling
230,000 copies a week. The
decline set in during the
Depression of the 30s

to about 73,000 and Ab-

stant voice that has told
our story over these many
years is allowed to disap-

The words of a young
news editor of the Kansas
City
Call, a
black
newspaper, provide a clue
to the answers to those
questions. The editor, Roy
Wilkins, later to become
executive director of the
NAACP wrote in 1928:

March 16, 1827. Its editor
was John Russwurm,
America's first black
college graduate. In his
maiden editorial Russwurm
set forth the principal
reasons why the paper had
come into being; reasons
that seem as pertinent
today in explaining the
need for the black press as
they were in 1827.
"We wish to plead our
own cause." he wrote.

There was no question

All these factors point up
the need for a black press,
but the failure of many of
these papers to increase
their circulation at a time
when population increases

tinue to mount,' indicate
that something is wrong. It
is not the purpose of this
paper to make a definitive
assessment of the
situation, but at the very
least there are several
questions that should be
considered.

The second is whether

It can never forget that it
came into being as a very
specialized press and that
it exerted its greatest in-
fluence when it cam-
paigned militantly and
responsibly against the
evils in our society.
There are lessons to be
learned from that glorious
past, for in creating
black press,
Americans added a needed
and valuable dimension to
the concept of a "free
press" in America. It
provided a forum in which
unpopular ideas were aired

minority and in the finest
spirit of the First Amend-

wrongs. The black press

Thus the die was cast.
Blacks were being told to
put their dreams of po-
litical and social equality
on the shelf. White
America was elated. Wash-

solution for the nation's
race relations and for the
next 20 years he would oC-

Freedom of the Press.
In writing into the First
Amendment the stricture
that "Congress shall make
no law abridging the
freedom of speech or the
press," there was both a
recognition of the vital role
the press had played in in-
fluencing public opinion in
America to throw off the
yoke of English rule . a
role which was regarded
as patriotic and not
treasonous and an effort
to insure that that freedom,
which had helped spawn
the revolution, would be
preserved. The Amend.
ment echoed Thomas Jef-
ferson's assertion that "our
country depends on the
freedom of the press and
that cannot be limited

to be a long one, or even a

developed between
Russwurm and his partner
in the venture, Samuel E.

favored the return of

changed its name to
"Rights For All" and con-
tinued to publish for a
short period of time before
the paper disappeared into
the shadows of history.
When the Journal ex-
pired, Cornish began
editing another black
newspaper, "The Weekly
Advocate," which first ap-
peared in January, 1837
and with a name change to
"The Colored American,"
was to remain in business
until 1842. A sympathetic
critic said of the short-lived
paper that "its columns
were filled with excellently
selected and original mat-
ter. It ably advocated the
emancipation of the en-
slaved and the elevation of
the free colored people."
Freedom and civility
toward blacks were the
dominant themes that ap-
peared not only in the first
two black papers, but in
the 40 or more that were to
appear prior to the Civil
War. Not content to stand
on the sidelines while
others did battle for them,
blacks found their own
newspapers to be the best
method of telling their
story and in the process
created an institution that
they themselves could con-
trol.
Many of the papers were
short-lived and all of them
were under extreme finan-
cial pressures. No editor,
given his limited market,
could expect to make
money from such papers
and indeed most of them
had to depend on their
own funds, or money from
contributors both black

practical matter, only those
who owned the press were
free to exercise that
freedom; those who were
non-owners could not, Just
as the government was
constitutionally prohibited
from telling a press-owner
what could or could not be
printed, so was a non-
press owner powerless to
determine what the press
should or should not say.
That privilege was reser-
ved for the owners, not the
consumers.
What the government
was guaranteeing was sim-
ply the basic right of the
press to operate free of
governmental restrictions,
not how well or how fairly
it should serve the public.
This basic concept has
been continually reaf-
firmed throughout the 200
years of the nation; most
recently in the decision of
the Supreme Court in the
case of the New York
Times vs United States.
Here the government
sought to prevent the

tions of the so-called Pen-
tagon Papers. The Court

"In the First Amendment

democracy. The press was
to serve the governed, not
the governors. The Gov-
ernment's power to censor
the press was abolished so
that the press would

There were other factors
that also began to operate
against the black press:
the general decline in
newspaper readership as
more and more people tur-

dispersal of black persons
outside the central-city
where the black papers
were available: the con-

the fight against

up with protests over the

to report on how blacks

the black press.

at Wilberforce University, a
black institution, stated
how most black editors felt
when he said:
"It is true that the Negro
press is getting more and
more militant
demands for
democracy at home, but
this growing impatience of
the press is quite naturaf
as well as desirable
unless the American Negro
is entirely unintelligent and
unprogressive he is bound
to demand his right to be a
free American, especially
when he is fighting abroad
for the preservation of
democracy.
The militant tone of the
press irritated the govern-
ment and there was talk
within the Roosevelt Ad-
ministration of
possibility of prosecuting
some of the editors for im-
peding the war
However, the talk
got beyond the discussion
stage and black papers
continued to point out the
contradiction between
what America publicity
proclaimed her war aims
and the reality of her treat-
ment of blacks at home.
The Double V campaign of
the Pittsburgh Courier
summed up the strategy of
the black press
Victory" over
abroad and "V for Victory"
over bigotry at home.
When the war ended the
black press was stronger
than ever. The combined
circulations of the more
than 180 papers were well
in excess of 2 million
copies a week; the papers
had built up enormous
prestige among
their
readers on the strength of
their war coverage both
foreign and domestic; and
increasingly more talented
people were attracted to
black journalism.
In 1956 - two years after
the Supreme Court
decision outlawing
segregation in public
schools the Washington,
D.C. Afro-American in А
burst of inspiration printed
headline that in
retrospect prophesied the
changes that were about to
occur in America
changes that would have
enormous import for the
black press. Appearing
over a story that told of a
Supreme Court decision
upholding the legality of
several public accom-
modations laws that had
been passed for the
District of Columbia but
which had been allowed to
slip into disuse, the
headline said simply
"EAT ANYWHERE."
The decade that
followed saw a permanent
alteration in America's way
of life. Discrimination and
segregation lost their
protection under the law
and were not longer
publicly acceptable - but
they did not disappear en-
tirely. A higher level of in-
tegration between persons
and within institutions was
achieved although, the
level of integration was

on white beneficiaries, the
black papers could strike
out boldly at racism and
say those things that many
blacks wanted to say but
were in no position to say.
A New Voice Emerges
These new papers could
also be economically vi-
able as was demonstrated
by Robert Abbot who has
been described as "the
greatest single voice in the
black press.' Abbott began
the Chicago Defender on a
shoestring in 1905 when
the city had a black
population of some 40,000
persons.

South turned loose on
blacks after the North, in
the Compromise of 1877,

One
editor who tried
and failed was Ida B.
Wells, a teacher and
publisher of the Memphis
Free Speech. In 1892 she
saw her printing plant
wrecked because she had
published an article that
suggested white capitalists
had inspired the murder of
three black businessmen.
She was forced to flee the
city to save her life.
În commenting on this
period, the historian,
Lerone Bennett, Jr., has
written:

press diminished. There

A Void To Be Filled
But to return to the past.
From the earliest days of
the nation, the concept of
a free press was
meaningless to at least
one group of Americans -
the blacks. The majority
were slaves and the prin-
cipal interest of the press
in their condition was to

own equality and even
superiortiy."
The attacks on the black
press were carried to the
floor of Congress as well
and there Congressman
James F. Byrnes - later to
be Governor of South Car-
olina, Secretary of State
and a member of the Su-
preme Court - placed the
blame for "The Red Sum-
mer" squarely on the
shoulders of the black
press which he accused of
inflaming its readers.
As a consequence of the
wide spread riots that de-
veloped, a former em-
ployee of the Chicago De-
fender, Claude A. Barnett,
established the Associated
Negro Press, the first
national black news ser-
vice, which he operated
from 1919 to 1964.
Given the attitude of the
South toward the news-
papers coming down from
the North, and the fact that
blacks were still under the
domination of whites in the
South, it would have been
expecting too much to
have the papers published
in the South assume the
same militant stance as
their sister papers in the
North. And in fact, they did
not. It was a matter of sur-
vival.
"Freedom of the (south-
ern black) press was
minimal," Theodore G. Vin-
cent has observed in
"Voices of a Black Nation-
Political Journalism in the
Harlem Renaissance", go-
ing on to note that it was
dangerous for these south-
ern papers to endorse any-
thing considered contro-
versial, including the
NAACP and trade union-
ism.

The Harlem Renaissance
- that period during the 20s
when black creativity
flourished as never before
- saw the development of a
number of important black
publications edited by
what Vincent calls "the"
New Negroes of
Renaissance" who "seized
the opportunity to
form the black press from
an institution for the cul-
tured elite into a mass
media organ for all black
people."
One of the leading week-
lies of the period was Mar-
cus Garvey's “New World",
the organ of his worldwide
black nationalist organ-
ization, the Universal
Negro Improvement
Association. The strong
voice of A. Philip Randolph
thundered from the pages
of the magazine
"Messenger". W.E.B. Du-
Bois made the NAACP's
"Crisis" magazine into one
of the most influential
magazines of the times.
And at the National Urban
League, Dr. Charles S.
Johnson began

was to publish an astound-
ing variety of articles,
stories and poetry by some
of the nation's most out-
standing figures. There
other black mag-
azines published during
this era, but only "Crisis"
survives today.
The black press in the
North continued to grow,
in strength and influence,
and was slowed only by
the impact of the Great De-
pression. This was a
period from the early part
of the century through
Word War I - in which the
black press had learned
some valuable lessons, not
the least of which was the
potential strength it had in
its hands. It had seen its
readership grow, it had
trained its own journalists,
it had been able to survive
financially because of the
support of black people.
and it had not surrendered
to those who sought to
silence it.
The importance of this is
underscored by the fact
that since Russwurm's first
paper, there was always
two separate and distinct
presses in America for
blacks the white press
and the black press. But it
was only in the black press
that blacks could find any
recognition of themselves
as human beings. Like the
rest of white America, the
white press largely ignored
them.
Carrying on its tradition
of independence, the black
press established its own
national organization in
1940 with the organization
of the National Newspaper
Publishers Association,
which has consistently fill-
ed a leadership role in the
struggle of blacks.
The onset of World War
I brought the black press
to a new critical juncture in
its history. The issue, re-
duced to its basic elements
was that with racism so
rampant at home, was the
black press justified in
suggesting that black men
should lay their lives on
the line to fight foreign dic-
tators. The answer was

the
that the black
dividual, Abbott was re-
sponsible for the massive
migration of blacks from
the South to the North dur-
ing and after World War I.
His paper was widely cir-
culated in
in the South,
sometimes clandestinely
because in many places
the white authorities
sought to have it sup.
pressed. In the pages of
the Chicago Defender
readers were told of the
benefits to be found in
living in the North and they
took Abbott's invitation
and headed for Chicago.
The Defender dig more
than just talk about coming
North, it led in the form-
ation of clubs that could
avail themselves of rail-
road group rates for the I

Richmond Planet:
"Unless
President
(Woodrow) Wilson speaks
out like Col. Roosevelt, un-
less I am assured that the
flag will offer protection to
the 12,000,000 colored
people in the country, and
unless I am convinced that
world democracy includes
black men as well as white
men, I shall consider my-
self a disgrace to my race
and country by freely
volunteering to fight for a
democracy across the sea,
because I firmly believe
and maintain that
democracy like charity
should begin at home and
spread abroad."
Acting on the premise
that nothing should be al-
lowed to interfere with the
country's mobilization, the
postmaster ordered all
copies of the issue con-
taining the article held at
the Richmond Post Office
and threatened to revoke
the second-class mailing
privileges of the Planet.
Eventually, the copies
were released, but a clear
warning had been sounded
as to what could happen to
dissenters.
The irony of how 'free-
domof the press was being
interpreted by the govern-
ment was not lost on the
black press and in its Aug-
ust 11, 1917 edition, the
Afro-American
comment-
ed: "There would be little
difference between demo-
cratic America and auto-
cratic Europe if citizens
should feel themselves ob-
ligated to remain sitent un-
der real or fancied injus-
tices."

In 1918, a black mag-
azine, "The Messenger",
actually lost its second-
class mailing privilege for
three years for publishing

issue of the same mag-
azine was denied the use

sidered its radical content.
of the same magazine was
denied the use of the mails
entirely for what
the
government considered its
radical content.
There was never any
question that blacks did
not have reasons to com-
plain the lynching total
was 60 in 1916, 36 in 1917
and 60. in 1918- but the
government wanted critic-
ism kept to a minimum dur-
ing wartime.
The year 1919 was the
worse of all. James Weld-
on Johnson called it "The
Red Summer" and red it
was - red with blood. As
black servicemen began to
return home, 26 re e riots
broke out in the country
with the largest occurring
in Washington, D.C., Chi-
cago, Omaha, Knoxville,
Longview, Texas, and
Phillips County, Arkansas.
Six persons were killed
and 150 wounded in the
nation's Capitol; 15 whites
and 23 blacks were killed
in Chicago and 537 In-
jured, and in Omaha, a
mob lynched and burned a
black man, attempted to
hang the mayor who tried
to intervene and set fire to
the county courthouse.
Against this background
of violence, the black
press protested mightily.
The government respond-
ed by issuing a report
"Radicalism and Sedition
Among The Negroes, As
Reflected in Their Public-
ations". The report ignored
the riots and lynchings
and, in effect charged the
black press with stirring
things up. The report was
prepared by the Justice
Department and the com-
piler was J. Edgar Hoover,
later to become head of
the F.B.I.
The report read in part:
"At this time there can
no longer be any question
of a well concerted move-
ment among a certain
class of Negro leaders of
thought and action to con-
stitute themselves a deter-
mined and persistent
source of radical op-
position to the government
and to the established rule
of law and order.
"Among the more salient
points to be noted in the
present attitude of the
Negroes leaders are, first,
the ill governed reaction
toward race rioting;
second the threat of re-
talitory measures in con-
nection with lynching:
thira, the more openly ex-
pressed demand for social
equality, in which the sex
problem is not infrequently
included...
"Underlying these more
salient viewpoints is the in-
creasingly emphasized
feeling of race
sciousness in
many of
these black publications
always antagonistic to the
white race, and openly,
defiantly assertative of its

cause that was closer to
them and their readers
than to anyone else. It
could not have been other-
wise.
A Decline In Militancy
Once the guns of the
Civil War fell silent there
was a great rush to set up
black newspapers. During
the decade
publications
after
1865,
were
established in eight states
which
previously had
none, and in four others
that already had papers. By
1890, 575 papers had come
into being. Many of these
were regular newspapers
while others were political
organs, church papers or
publications designed to
serve some specific in-
terest group.
A number of reasons
have been advanced by Dr.
Armisted S. Pride of Lin-
coln University (Mo.), for
the spread of the black
press in the post-Civil War
era. Among them were, the
Negro editors
like T.
and
Fortune
Thomas
Calvin
Chase, but the
press, as a whole, was not
as militant as the North
Star and other periodicals
of the abolitionist era."
This was also the period
of the
the "Atlanta Com-
promise" which was to set
the pattern for acceptable
black/white relationships
over the next several de-
cades. Its author was
Booker T. Washington,
then a relatively obscure

Tuskeegee In-
a single
speech delivered on Sep-
tember 18, 1895 at the Cot-
ton State's Exposition in
Atlanta, Georgia, he was
catapulted into national
and international pro-
minence as the annointed
leader of his people. Put-
ting aside, at least tempor-
arily, any quest for social
and political equality for
the black man, Washington
told white America what it
wanted to hear and was
prepared to accept.
He told his black

to whether black

longer needed.
The white press, as a
direct result of the civil
rights movement and the
changes it was producing.
began to give more atten-
tion to black affairs. No
longer was the black press
the only medium telling the
story of black people. The
white media: newspapers,

and

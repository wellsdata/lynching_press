A Useless Verdict.
" Yes," said the old traveler," I was
California once. It
jury in was
on a
a murder trial. I didn't want the
fellow hanged and so stuck out
against the other 11 for nine days,
locked up in the jury room, when
they gave in, and we brought in a
verdict of' Not guilty,' and then I
was ready to stab myself with spite."
" What about?"
" Cause the mob had hanged the
prisoner on very first day we
were locked up the."- Exchange.

Arizona Democrat: Officers on
the western border of Gila
county fear an outbreak and race
war between Mexicans and whites
at Christmas, near Winkleman, as
the result of the killing of a Mexi-
can at the mining camp Tuesday
night by Deputy Sheriff Pember-
ton, of Gila county., in the discharge
of his duty. As soon as the
Mexican miners, who number fully
300 in the Christmas camp, learned
of the killing by Peraberton of one
of their number, they organized
into a mob and attempted to lynch
the officer, who held them at bay
during the greater part of Tuesday
night with the assistance of the
white miners who are greatly in
the majority.,

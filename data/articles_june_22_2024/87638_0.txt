Lynched a Murderer.
COLUMBUS, Ga., April 12.- At Seale, Ala.,
Reddy Adams, who was in jail charged with
the murder of R. F. Renfro, a prominent
merchant of that place, was taken from jail
last night at 12 o'clock by a mob and hanged.
The crime for which Adams was lynched
was committed last November. The negro
waylaid Mr. Renfro, killed him and then
robbed the body, afterwards burning Renfro's
house. Adams was tried last week, but his
case was continued, and the citizens,
he would be acquitted, decided to lynch fearing him.

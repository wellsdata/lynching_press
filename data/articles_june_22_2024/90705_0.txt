This special message is sent to Congress by the President
during the same week that announcement is made of
the lynching of 69 men and women in the South during
the year 1915. Not a word of protest issues from the
White House in condemnation of this terrible lawlessness.
A special message from the President would center attention
upon this deplorable practice and if the President
could see his may clear that" indemnities" were paid the
victims of lynch law in country, the practice would
cease. this

Receives

STRIP GIRL NUDE, BUT
NO LYNCHING
FOLLOWS
COLUMBUS, GA., Sept. 8.- Wal-
ter McClellan, aged 20 and Richard
Smith, aged 22, both white, were today
arrested here after being charged
with outraging a young girl and stripping
her body nude. She was then
allowed to roam the woods in her
nude condition. Although the crime
is much more repulsive than many for
which colored men have been lynched
there was no hint of lynch law.,

Springfield, Mo., Aug. 27.- The jury
in the case of Doss Galbraith, the alleged
leader of the mob which lynched
three negroes here in April last, and
who was on trial charged with second

were unable to agree. The jury
had considered the case for more than
twenty- four hours. After the jury
was discharged its members freely admitted
that the vote stood ten for ac-
quittal and two for conviction. Twen
ballots were taken, and there was
ty no change after the first ballot.

FOUR NEGROES LYNCHED.
A Tennessee Mob Terribly Avenges the
Outrage of Two White Women.
NASHVILLE, Tenn., April 29.- A telephone
message from Goodletsville, a
miles
small place some twelve
from this city, states that four negro
men have been lynched at that
place and two other parties shot at.
The cause of the lynching was that the
negroes outraged two daughters
of a brutally respectable white family.

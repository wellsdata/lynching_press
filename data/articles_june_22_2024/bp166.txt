Coleman told newsmen he has
excellent reason" to believe that
the crime would be solved, but
added "I cannot reveal my rea-
sons." State highway patrol chief
Bill Hood, however, told reporters
appeared the investigation by
his men had reached a "stand-
still."
More than 40 special agents of
the FBI were also working day
and night on the case, both in
South Mississippi and in the area
of Bogalusa, La., 21 miles from
here across the Pearl River. Park-
er was held for trial on charges
of raping a young white mother
who lived until recently at Boga-
lusa.
FULL ASSISTANCE
In Washington, Attorney General
William P. Rogers said the fed-
eral agents are giving full assis-
tance to local authorities in "ap-
prehending and bringing the guil-
ty parties to the bar of justice."
He said the "conscience of mer.
ica has been revolted and stunned.'
by the crime in Poplarville. He
said it emphasizes "the tragedy
and shame" when a "few men"
do not live by the free world con-
cept of the vital role of the rule
of law.
There has been speculation that
Parker's body could have been
thrown in the Pearl River, whose
muddy waters were 3 feet above
flood stage Saturday. Officers said
it would be very difficult to find
a body in the river under such con-
ditions.
AT STANDSTILL
"It looks like we are at a stand-
still," Hood said. He had headed
a squad of highway patrolmen as-
signed to the case by the governor.
Coleman, in Jackson, said he
had received a deluge of mail
from outside the state, much of
it demanding that the members
of the mob be apprehended and
punished. He said he had receiv.
ed about 20 letters of the "threat-
ening type." However, he said the
mail was "not as much as I had
anticipated."
The FBI set up an additional
office in the Poplarville city hall,
in addition to its headquarters
here and brought in secretaries.

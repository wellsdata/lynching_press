Wm. B. Glover, living near Middle-
brook, is a young farmer, industrious,
hardworking and respected by his neighbors
. By hard work he was just turning
the hill and had built a$ 3,500 barn. On
Sunday night, the 3rd of April, he was
aroused by two young men running by
his house and crying out to him that his
barn was on fire. It was totally destroyed
with all in it, and in a few minutes his
little fortune had been wrecked. It was
clearly a case of incendiarism and the
community was aroused to the height of
indignation. A worthless negro named
Charles Venable in the neighborhood was
arrested on suspicion and carried before
Justice W. W. Cale by Constable R. W.
McClure on the following Saturday. In
his fright, whether guilty or innocent, the
negro alleged that it was Preston Johnson
another negro who set fire to it. That
night Johnson was arrested, and there
being loud talk of lynching the Constable,
assisted by J. W. Mish and A. J. Garrison
, had to take the prisoners a round
about way to Greenville to put them on
the cars for Staunton. During the following
Tuesday, Judge Stout received authoritative
information that a mob was forming
to come to Staunton and haug the prisoners
. He first arranged to have the military
called out, and about 9 o'clock that night
sent both prisoners in charge of Sheriff
Speck to the jail at Harrisonburg. About
midnight that night a man came to
town and waked up Chief of Polic
Waters
telling him crowd
a of
men were assembling on the road
between here and Middlebrook to come
to Staunton and lynch them, but the prisoners
by that time were far away. Not
long ago they were brought back for trial
at Staunton and the man Preston John-
son who had been accused of the burning
by Venable, was tried first, Venable
being made use of as a witness against
him. Johnson was defended by A. C.
Braxton and the State was represented
Meade F. White. by
A MAN AT LIBERTY WHO WAS
RACED TO HARRISONBURG
AT NIGHT TO SAVE HIM
FROM LYNCHING.

Kossuth county is widely excited
over the assault of a 12- year- old girl
near Algona by Joe McCain, a tramp.
He is lodged in the county jail and
trouble is feared, efforts being taken
by the sheriff to strengthen the guard
around the jail as a precaution
against possible lynching. McCain
went to the public school and called
out the daughter of Michael Hub
bard, telling her that her folks sent
him and told her to come home at
once. He had a livery team near at
hand and drove two miles south of
Algona to an old slaughter house,
where he assaulted the girl. He then.
drove to Burt and sold the buggy but
was later arrested.,

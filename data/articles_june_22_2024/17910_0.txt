WORK OF MOB
SAME AS MURDER
Judge Declares All Members of
Lynching Party Guilty.
MOB'S WORK IS CONDEMNED.
Judge Long, of Rowan County Court,
Very Severe In Denunciation of the
Infuriated Mob That Lynchd the Ne
groes at Salisbury.
Charlotte, N. C., Aug. 9.- Judge
Long called Rowan court to order at
Salisbury at the usual hour Wednes
day. Barring the keeping of his engagement
with it at this hour, it was
an unnecessary session. The grand
jury has not made a presentment of
the case against George Hall, who is
known to be one of the men leading
the mob to its death- dealing work
of torture and mutilation. Another
arrest has been made and the evidence
against a fellow by the name of
Cross is being worked up.
Solicitor Hammer is being urged
to proceed with his work against Hall.
The people wish to see an example
made of him, and his trial concluded
while the military is here to protect
him and the town.
Judge Long was still harder on the
mob Wednesday. He said:
The court is informed that a kinsman
of the murdered people plead
with that band of cut- throats and murderers
to let the law proceed. Any
man who aided and abetted in that
lynching was guilty of murder in the
first degree. Any man who gave
encouragement by word or presence,
or took any part in it, was guilty of
murder in the first degree.
" The question now. is simply
whether the law shall be enforced by
the courts or by a mob and Rowan
,
county should to a man take a stand
on that proposition. When sifted to
the bottom you will find, as I have
said before, that no man of character
and standing was in that mob .. I
am going to perform my duty as I
see it, and have no fear. I said be-
fore I had apprehended any trouble
that the law of the lan dwas stronger
than any local mob. I do not take
that back, notwithstanding the shots
about my ears that night. The mills
of the gods grind slowly, but they
grind exceedingly fine.'
" The honor and integrity of Rowan
must be preserved."
The grand jury then retired to its
deliberating room and the sitting was
over.
The three companies of militia are
still on duty around the jail and the
town of Salisbury is practically under
military rule, but beyond the arrest
of Cress there have been no developments
.
Feeling ran high in Salisbury again
Thursday when news reached here
that the barn on the farm of Isaac
Lyerly, for the murder of whose family
the three negroes were lynched
here Monday night, was burned short-
ly after midnight presumably by the
friends of the negro lynched.
Two horses were so badly burned
that they The mili-
had to be shot.
tia is still on duty guarding the jail,
and court house. The case of the
alleged lynchers under arrest probably
will not be taken up at this term
of court.
George Hall, the first man arrested,
desires to submit to a charge of conspiracy
, the maximum penalty for
which is a sentence to the penitentiary
. It is expected many indictments
will be returned by the
jury. grand

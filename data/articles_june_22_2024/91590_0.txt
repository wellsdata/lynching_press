NEW ORLEANS, LA., June 24.- Lawlessness
reigned supreme in Gretna, a suburb
of this city, last night. As a result
one man has suffered death at the hands
of a mob of lynchers and another is dying.
Last evening a gang of rowdies declared
their intention of lynching a negress
named Frances Woodsen. The crowd was
composed of six young white men well
known in the community. At about 10
o'clock they went to the house of the
negress, but she heard of their threats
against her life and had left. The hoodlums
broke in the door and set fire to the
building, an alarm of fire was turned
in and the but flames were quickly subdued.
As soon as the outrage was known the
citizens organized and determined to lynch
the gang, but the hoodlums eluded arrest.
At midnight they committed a second
outrage when they ran across an old negro
and beat him to the point of death. Officer
Goodlet finally caught John Frey, one
of the gang, and as the news.quickly
spread, the citizens gathered in force, intercepted
the officer, and, taking the
prisoner from him, hanged the man to the
nearest telegraph pole.
Early this morning three others of the
gang were caught and locked up, and it is
feared they may suffer the same fate
Frey to- night. as

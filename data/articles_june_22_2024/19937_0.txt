WASHINGTON, April 15.- Inquiry in
the statement coming
this city confirms
from Rome that a complete and amicable
settlement has been reached in
the international difficulties between
the United States and Italy, growing
out of the New Orleans
tragedy. It appears that the government
of the United States has voluntarily
taken the initiative in closing the
breach, and without committing itself
to the recognition of any claim for
indemnity, but simply as an act of
justice and from motives of comity,
has placed in the hands of the Marquis
Imperiali, the Italian charge d'affaires
here, the sum of 125,000 franes, or$ 25,-
000, for distribution among the heirs of
the three Italians who were
Orleans and who
killed at New
were found to be subjects of the
Italian government. It is understood
the money was taken from the annual
appropriation of$ 80,000 to enable the
president to provide for unforeseen
emergencies in the diplomatic and consular
service, so that it will be unnecessary
to call upon congress for a spe-

By this action on the part of the
United States government the disagreeable
complications in the relations
of the two governments, it
is believed, have been removed
and within a short time the diplomatic
relations between the two
countries will be restored to the amicable
status existing before the New Or-
leans tragedy, Minister Porter returning
to Rome and a minister from Italy
taking up his post at Washington.
LONDON, April 15.- A dispatch received

state, and Marquis Imperiali, Italian
charge d'affaires at Washington,
resulting in a settlement of
the differences between Italy and
the United States growing out of
the lynching of Italians at New Or-
leans. According to this dispatch
Marquis Imperiali has advised the Ital-
ian government that he has received
from the United States government the
sum of$ 25,000 for the families of
victims. the

PAID THE PENALTY.
Negro Slayer of Miss Bishop Burned
at Newcastle, Del.
NEWCASTLE, Del., June 23.- A
mob of 2,000 persons battered into the
county workhouse here, obtained
George White, the negro charged with
assaulting and killing Helen Bishop
last Monday, and took him to Price's
Corners, the scene of his crime. He
there confessed to having assaulted the
girl and was burned at the stake and
his body riddled with bullets.
There was quite a fusillade for a time
between the mob and guards at the
the
prison. Four members of the mob are
said to have been shot. It is known
that Peter Smith, seventeen years old,
was shot in the back.
The guards played a strong stream of
water from a hose into the crowd,
which stubbornly held its ground, declaring
it would get the negro.
The mob then battered in several
of the doors of the workhouse with
railway ties and made a search of the
cells for White.
Dynamite was placed around the
building, and the leaders of the mob
declared they would blow up the building
unless the negro was surrendered.
The trembling negro was discovered
crouching in a cell in the workhouse
by the mob, who started with him for
Price's Corners, the scene of the assault
and murder.
The mob that lynched White was incited
to do the deed by the sermon of a
local minister er.. At At a a large open air
meeting the Rev. Robert A. Elwood,
pastor of Olivet Presbyterian church,
displayed a cluster of leaves stained
with the blood of Helen Bishop and in
a sermon entitled" Should the Murderer
of Miss Bishop Be Lynched?" roundly
denounced the judges for refusing to
hold a special session of court for the
trial of White.
The Rev. E. A. Bishop, father of the
girl, issued a letter asking the
to allow the law to take its course citizens.

EXCITEMENT IN NATCHEZ.- The Vicksburg Whig of the
10th inst., says:
" We learn from a gentleman from Natchez, that the
people of that city were intensely excited on Saturday
last, in consequence of the perpetration of a most beastly
outrage on the person of a young girl, about 11 years
old, by a fellow named Smitzer. When they left, there
was every indication that lynch law would be resorted to.
" We also learn that a man named Quin shot a negro
there on Friday, and on Saturday, Quin's father shot another
man."
A despatch to the New Orleans papers, dated at Natch-
ez, 10th inst., states that Smitzer was taken to prison on
Saturday, but that the excitement of the populace continued
to increase until Tuesday evening, when they assembled
in a great crowd, and marched deliberately to
the jail, took the prisoner from his cell, and hung him in
the courthouse yard. Everything passed off quietly,
at 3 o'clock the crowd dispersed. and

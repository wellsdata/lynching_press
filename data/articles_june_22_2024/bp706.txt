Portsmouth, O.. Oct. 8.-Black Texus,
a bandit,. is condemned to death in the
electric chair for killing an engineer of
the C. & O. R. R. at Ashlund, Ky. From
all evidences he is guilty and should pay
the penalty. The trial, however, was
rather speedy, but even this is a grand
discount for mob and lynch law too often
practiced.
Three men now held in
the county jail for dynamiting a laborers'
camp are indicted by the late grand
jury and are being tried 'upon evidence
produced. It is hoped that, should they
be found guilty, they should be punished
to the fullest extent of the law, even
death in the chair as their reward. It is
to be remembered that five men died and
equally as many are malmed for life by
their dirty work for which they are called
to answer. * * * Mrs. Swartz will speak

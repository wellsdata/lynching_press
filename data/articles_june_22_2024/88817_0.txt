A white resturant keeper in the
South asked one of the soldiers
or
the twenty fifth infantry why the
government was sending colored
men to Cuba; he volunteered the
information that they would not
fight and
very promptly
was
knocked down and out. There
was no lynching of the colored
soldier who struck the white man
and this leads us to think that the
permanent location of soldiers in
the South would exercise a healt-
ful influence upon the
element.- Omaha Progress lawless.

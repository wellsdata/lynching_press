Escaped From Mob.
A mob was formed when Dumas became
aware of the murder, and an effort
was made to get Rhea. Officers
had captured him in the meantime
however, and kept him under guard in
a dense woods for two days to preven
the mob from lynching him. When
seemed that his case was hopeless,
and that he would be hanged, his sentence
was commuted to life imprisonment
by Governar Joe T. Robinson.
By a change of venue, Rhea was
tried and convicted in Pine Bluff. Attorney
T. Havis Nixon, then prosecuting
attorney, Attorney S. J. Hunt,
and Judge W. B. Sorrells, than an
attorney, prosecuted the case. Col.
Murphy, and ex- governor X. O. Pen-
dall, Little Rock, were the attorneys
for the defense.
Rhea came of a prominent
county family. Saline

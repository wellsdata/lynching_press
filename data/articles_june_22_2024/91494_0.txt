NEGRO MURDERER LYNCHED.
Confessed to Killing Two Men and
Asked for Quick Justice.
Minter City, Miss., Dec. 29.- Joseph
Hopkins, the negro who murdered two
white men on Christmas Day at Glen-
dora, a small inland town near this
place, was captured by a posse at daylight
yesterday morning on the James
plantation, near Swan Lake. Hopkins
concealed himself in a gin house, but
was discovered by two negroes, who
gave the alarm.
Hopkins fought like a demon before
being taken into custody, and when arrested
it was found the negro had been
shot in three places. He was not fatally
Injured, however, and was taken to the
Bcene of his terrible crime.
Hopkins confessed his guilt, and did
not plead for mercy, but begged his
captors to make quick work of him, and
the time was lost in carrying out the
request. A rope was placed about the
negro's neck, and he was hanged from
the limb of a tree. The body was then
riddled with bullets and left hanging.
Hopkins' record is bad one, many
recent crimes being attributed a to him.

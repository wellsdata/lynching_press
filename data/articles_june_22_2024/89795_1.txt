Mob After a Quack Doctor.
CEDAR RAPIDS, Ia., Jan. 8.- News
comes late to- night from Searsbery, a town
near Montezuma, to the effect that there
may be a lynching there before morning.
A medicine company gave a matinee this
afternoon. At the close of the performance
a traveling doctor called three little girls
behind the curtain. When the audience left
he assaulted one girl. The others escaped
and gave the alarm. At last accounts the
doctor was barricaded in the building, which
surrounded by a mob. The sheriff and
was deputies are hurrying to Searsbery.

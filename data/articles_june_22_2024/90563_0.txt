DANGEROUS TENDENCY OF
LYNCH LAW.
The dangerous tendency of lynch
law is forcibly illustrated by its latest
manifestation on the outskirts of New
Orleans, which is one of the most
wanton and barbarous instances of
lynching in the annals of lawlessness.
There was no pretence that the three
negros so o savagely" strung up" were
guilty of any other offence than refusing
to betray their brother to the savage
mob to be brutally murdered, or
that the fourth victim, kicked to death,
was any inore deserving of his awful
fate. But not even their conceded innocence
availed to save them from the
fury of the maddened crowd bent on
lynching the fugitive negro.
In former times lynch law resorted
to only by masked desperadoes was
under cover of darkness, to inflict sum-
mary punishment on the undoubted
perpetrator of a crime exceptionally
heinous, and it was regarded with horror
when committed in a well settled,
law- abiding community. But it has
grown alarmingly common in parts of
the country where it should not be
countenanced. It become the
means of savage torture has as well as of
death. It has been extended to ac-
cused criminals whose guilt has been
doubtful, and now it numbers even the
innocent among its victims. In short,
it has been spreading and growing
barbarous and more dangerous. more

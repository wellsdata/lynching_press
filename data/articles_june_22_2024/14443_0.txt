MARYLAND. LYNCHING IN
Frederick Goings, a Brutal Negra, Taken
From a Jail and Hanged by a
Mob.
FREDERICK, MD., Nov. 17.- Frederick
Goings, a young negro, begged food at the
residence of Hamilton' Giesbert, near this
city, yesterday afternoon. After eating a
meal he attacked Miss Tillie Jones, who
he discovered was alone in the house. In
overcoming the girl's resistance the negro
broke her nose and cut her with a razor.
He was arrested and held for a hearing on
Monday, Later he was taken from the
jail by a mob and hanged to a tree, on
which a few years ago a negro named
Bigus was lynched for the same crime.
Shortly before midnight a committee of
a half- dozen went to the jail door and demanded
the keys. Sheriff Zimmerman
refused to give them up. There was another
consultation the word was passed
,
among the 300 persons in the mob and the
whole body moved toward the prison. As
the leaders reached the stout oaken side
door Sheriff Zimmerman raised a window
and fired his revolver, but no one was
hurt. He also rang the jail bell for assistance
, but none came.
In an instant the jail door gave way before
the infuriated citizens. A moment
later a dozen stalwart men were hammering
at the door of Goings' cell.
While the negro crouched in a corner
piteously begging for mercy, the bars of
his cell door were wrenched from their
fastenings and he was dragged out of
jail and lynched. the

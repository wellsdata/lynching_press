Speech of Hon. George W. Wicker-
sham, former Attorney General, delivered
at a mass meeting of the
National Association for Advancement
of Colored
People, in the
Town Hall, Wdnesday Night, March
First.
Mr. Wickersham said in part:
" For many years, the number and
extent of lynchings in various parts
of the United States have provoked
adverse comment of foreign observers
and compelled a sense of national
humiliation on the part of Americans.
Of all forms of lawlessness this is perhaps
the worst, for it takes from the
duly constituted authorities of the
state their highest and most solemn
function, the administration of justice
.
" Lawless acts of this character have
been committed in many parts of the
country. Statistics used in the recent
debates in the House of Representatives
show, that between 1885 and
1921, 4,096 persons were lynched in
the United States; an average of 117
a year.
" In 1919, there were 83, and in 1920
65. By far the larger number of those
killed in this manner were Negroes;
but of the 83 lynched in 1919, 4 were
white and 2 Mexicans and of the 65
lynched in 1920, 10 were whites. The
greater number of these crimes are
the results of race antagonism, and
have occurred in the southern states.
Apolgists for this condition have
sought to excuse, or at all events to
palliate, these offences upon the
ground that the lynchings were OCcasioned
by outrages committed by
colored men upon white women, and
that in no other than by summary
popular justice
could comparative
safety for white women be secured
in those communities where there is a
preponderance of colored population.
Statistics of these crimes refute this
theory. Of the 3,434 persons lynched
1919, only 570
from 1899 to were
charged with offenses against women
and of the 264 negroes lynched from
1914 to 1918, only 28 were so accused.
" The well known facts concerning
the lynching of colored people show
that during a period of years, to a
very great extent they have been deprived
of life and property and have
not enjoyed equal protection of the
laws with white people. If the states
have denied and deprived them of
these constitutional privileges, Congress
, under the constitution, may afford
them redress.
" The distinction above suggested is
sought to be preserved in the bill passed
by the house of representatives on
Januray 26th, 1922( H. R. 13, A Bill' to
assure to persons within the jurisdiction
of every state the equal protection
of the laws and to punish the
crime of lynching.
" The bill was elaborately debated
in the house of representatives. It
was significant that the opposition to
it came almost entirely from the
southern states. Constitutional objections
were urged and at the close
of the debate the bill was amended
by substituting a substantially new
measure in order to meet this criticism
. It is to be hoped that the senate
will pass the bill and send it
the president for his approval. to

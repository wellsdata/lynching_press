NEW ORLEANS'S ITALIAN LYNCHINGS.
Trial of a Bult in Whteh a Vietim's Citizens
ship is Not Disputed.
NEW ORLEANS. La., Deo. 5.- The trial of the
first of the famous Italian cases on its merits
came up before a jury in the United States Circuit
Court to- day. The lynching of the Italians
on account of the assassination of Chief of Police
Hennessey occurred March 14, 1891. The
relatives of nearly all the lynched brought suit
for damages against the city of New Orleans
and the leader of the mob who did the lynching
. In the first case which came up Judge
Billings decided that the plaintiff was an
American, not an Italian, citizen; therefore the
suit did not lie.
There was no such dispute in the case on
trial to- day. it having been brought by the
widow of Antonio Abbagneto, generally known
as Bagnetto. The plaintiffs will endeavor to
show that the dead Italian was killed without
justification in law, and that the city, having
taken no steps to prevent his execution, Is
under the law responsible for the work done
by the mob on that day. It is not expected that
any new light will be thrown upon the occurrences
in the parish prison or upon the identity
of those who took a conspicuous part in
the scenes within the prison. Most of the
witnesses who have been summoned were be
fore the State Grand Jury, and that body was
unable to get any definite information from
them.
Among the witnesses summoned to testify
are Capt. Lem Davis, who was in charge of the
prison on the day of the lynching, and nearly
all of his deputies, who were with him, and a
number of newspaper reporters. No difficulty
whatever was experienced in securing a jury.
all those examined testifying that they were
without prejudice and could try the case on
its merits. There are dozen other suits yeu
to be brought, all to the a same effect.

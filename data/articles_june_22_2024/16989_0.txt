MURDER AND LYNCH LAW.- We learn from
the Grenada( Miss.) Republican of a case of
murder and lynch law which occurred recently
near that place. A Mr. Bingham, residing near
Grenada, was missing A party of ten fif
.
. or
teen citizens, supposing that he had been thrown
from his horse, and either killed or disabled,
repaired, so soon as the news was made known,
to his farm, and searched the woods for a considerable
distance around, but without making
any discoveries tending in the least to solve the
mystery of his absence. After another search
suspicion was directed to some of his own slaves.
Most of them denied any knowledge of the
cause of their master's absence but
, one was
finally induced to disclose the whole affair, and
conducted the party having them in charge to
the place where the body was concealed. The
others then corrobrated his statement as to all
material facts. It appears from this confession
that a conspiracy to murder the deceased had
been entered into by all the slaves,( three of his
own and one hired slave,) several weeks prior
to the commission of the act. On Sunday night,
the 22d ult
they accomplished their
. design
as
,
Mr. B. was entering his smoke house after supper
, for the purpose of giving them their rations.
As he was unlocking the door one of the negro
struck him
men stunning blow
a the back
on of the
head with a club, the other immediately jump-
upon him and grasped his hands, and the negro
woman secured his feet, while the first
caught him by the throat, and made the fourth,
young bring which fastened
a
negro a rope
, was
,
around his neck. By this means he was strangled
until life was extinct. His body was then
thrown into a neighboring creek, and the ne-
spent the remainder of the
groes night in singing
and dancing. Two of the negroes were
taken into custody and a guard placed over them,
but they were seized by a mob and. Two
others were placed in jail.-N. O. hung Picayune.

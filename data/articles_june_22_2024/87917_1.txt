Mayor An Angry Mob
for the Blood of the Murderer Howling.
SPARTANBURG, S. C., Sept. 20.- This
little city, situated on the Charlotte&
Atlanta railway, was the scene of a
tragedy to- day. John Williams, a
burly negro, was making a disturbance
at home with his wife. Cries of
all sorts were heard from that direction
, and Mayor Henneman went to
the house to find out the cause. He
arrested Williams and was trying to
prevent his escape until the police
came to his assistance. Williams succeeded
in push ng Henneman out of
the door and while he was falling shot
him in the back, killing him instantly.
Groups of excited men gathered all
over the city talking of nothing else.
The jail was surrounded py a howling
mob, and lacked only a leader to procure
the prisonor. There is no doubt
couth Carolina will add another iynch-
ing to her list to night.
Mayor Henneman some time ago
prevented a mob from lynching Murderer
Turner, an influential farmer
who killed his brother- in- law. Henne-
man on this occasion mounted a cannon
which the mob placed near the
jail and with a pistol in his hand
shouted that he would kill the first
person who approached jail. By
his coolness Turner was saved the.

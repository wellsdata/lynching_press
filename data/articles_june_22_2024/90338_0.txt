PIONEER'S STORY OF THE CAPTURE
KILLING OF BILLY THE KID
The story of the capture, and later
the killing of Billy the Kid, by Sheriff
Pat Garrett of Lincoln county, New
Mexico, which has been revived and
was printed in the Solomonville Bulletin
recently, and since has been copied
over the state by various papers, revives
in the minds of the old timers
of what was then the territories of
New Mexico and Arizona, many incidents
in regard to the farious outlaw
. The following account of the
capture of Billy the Kid, as he was
known, whose real name was William
H. Bonney, is related by a Cochise
county man who was with Pat Garrett
when he captured the Kid the first
time, and relates the facts of the adventure
without adornment:
The depredations of Billy the Kid
and his game in cattle stealing forced
the men in the Panhandle country to
organize and go on a search for their
cattle and incidentally to help get the
Kid. About the middle of November,
1880, a small party from the XL
ranch in the Panhandle country went
to Lincoln county, New Mexico, on a
search for stolen cattle. In the party
were Tom Emory, Louis Bausman,
Billy Williams, Lon Chambers and
James H. East, now a resident of Dou-
glas.
Following the Trail
On reaching Lincoln they found that
the cattle had been taken to Ft. Summer
. They followed the trail, only to
learn the cattle had been sold by the
Kid and his gang to a man who furnished
the Mescalero Apaches and
soldiers with meat. They returned to
Lincoln and put themselves at the
service of Sheriff Pat Garrett to help
capture the Kid. News was received
that the Kid was near Ft. Summer,
which was then a deserted army post.
They proceeded to that place, reaching
there in the evening. They camped
in one of the adobe buildings.
The Kid and his gang, composed of
Tom Pickett, Billy Wilson, Dave Rude-
baugh and Tom O'Folliard, did not
wait for Garrett and his posse to hunt
them. They made a raid on them that
night and tried to drive off the horses
of Garrett and his men. A fight ensued
in which the Kid and his men
were routed. Tom O'Folliard, one of
the Kid's men, was mortally wounded
and after Kid and his gang fled, O'-
Folliard was cared for by Garrett and
his men, but died in a short time.
Hide at Ranch
The next day the posse took the
trail and was told by a man named
Willcox that the Kid and his men
were at Tivan, an old ranch, The
word Tivan is an Indian word meaning
" stinking waters," because springs
near there when riled had a disagreeable
odor, Garrett and his men arrived
at the Tivan ranch in the early
morning and ambushed themselves
near the house. One of the outlaws
came out to feed a horse. He heard
the ambushed men and raised his six-
shooter to fire, when one of Garrett's
men fired and wounded him. He went
in the house. Kid said to him," You
are shot anyway, go out and parley
with Garrett." The man staggered
out, but fell dead before he had said
anything. His body fell across one of
Garrett's men.
All Day Siege
Garrett was desirous of taking the
Kid alive, and the siege lasted all day.
The Kid would josh Garrett and ask
him if he was not hungry, that they
had plenty of hot biscuits and coffee
in the house. At last the outlaws
surrendered, as two of their men were
killed, and they were cut off from
their horses.
The prisoners, the Kid, Wilson,
Rudebaugh and Pickett, were taken
overland to Las Vegas, where Rude-
baugh was wanted for a killing. There
Garrett and his men had to stand off
a mob who wanted to lynch the outlaws
. They were then taken by rail
to Santa Fe. When Garrett and his
men took the outlaws to the train they
told the passengers that it was Kid
and his gang they were taking and
there might be trouble en route. All
the passengers decided to lay over in
Las Vegas, except two old prospectors
who were going to Socorro. They
stayed with the train.
Gov. Lew Wallace
At Santa Fe the Kid was turned
over to Governor Lew Wallace, then
governor of the territory of New
Mexico. Later the Kid was taken to
Lincoln, where he was wanted for the
wanton shooting of Sheriff Brady,
former sheriff of Lincoln county, New
Mexico. He was convicted and in
May, 1881, when only 23 years old,
was sentenced to be hung. He had up
io that time killed 25 men.
Lodged in jail there, with two dep-
uties of sheriff Garrett, named Bob
Ollinger and John Bell, to guard him,
he was awaiting his execution. He
was kept handcuffed and shackled.
One day he was alone with Bell, whom
he engaged in conversation. The Kid
had a very pleasing personality and
he had Bell so engrossed with his
narrative that he succeeded in getting
near, grabbing Bell's six- shooter,
and with him a dexterity that was amaz-
ing, with his hands shackled, shot
Bell. The Kid went to the outer room
and got a Winchester. Ollinger heard
the shot and started up the steps. The
Kid heard him, went to the stairs, he
called," Hello Bob." Ollinger looked
up. The Kid shot him with the Win-
chester he had secured.
Kid's Escape
The Kid left the jail, went across
to a blacksmith shop and forced the
blacksmith, at the point of a gun, to
cut his handcuffs and shackles. He
took a horse tied on the street and
made his escape. From May until
July, the Kid was at large, hiding in
the vicinity of Ft. Summer and the
Maxwell ranch; at which place he had
a sweetheart, which fact proved his
undoing. He came to the ranch to
visit the girl and in this way Sheriff
Garrett got news of his whereabouts.
Garrett went to the ranch, entered
the house in which the Kid was, and
waited in the living room for the Kid,
who had been to another part of the
house. The Kid was armed and on
the alert. He sensed a strange presence
and asked in Spanish," Who is
there?" Garrett fired, killing the Kid
instantly.
Garrett Criticized
Garrett has been criticized by some
for his act, but in the face of the life
of the Kid and the 27 men he had
slain, his last victims, Ollinger and
Bell, it was necessary, for had the
Kid seen Garrett, he would have shot
him on sight. Garrett was a brave
man and a fearless officer.
An incident of the trip made to Las
Vegas with the prisoners was the fact
that the man who drove the wagon
that carried the Kid and his companions
was the father of the man who
afterwards killed sheriff Garrett.
Garrett and his men received a reward
of$ 500 from the territory of
New Mexico, a present of$ 100 from
a Dr. Nauer in Santa Fe, and$
from the town of Las Vegas. 1,500
This Chick Scratched Too Long
The following notice appeared in
last week's Jerome News:
To the Shareholders of the Oak
Creek Telephone Company:
Having served you for some five
years past as Manager, Treasurer and
Bookkeeper, without compensation or
thanks.
Having asked repeatedly for some
means of raising funds for repairs
and current expenditures on line,
which has been refused.
Having had for months at a time
to pay for the upkeep of the line, as
well as for the monthly exchange
service at Jerome, from my private
funds.
The expenditures being so great at
the present time, I feel that I am not
able longer to keep them up from my
private account.
Therefore, I hereby tender my resignation
as Manager and Treasurer
of the Oak Creek Telephone Company,
take effect September 1, 1915.
to C. S. CHICK

Georgia Sheriff and
Posse Lynch Oneand
DARIEN,
Ga., Sept. 12.-
One man is dead and an-
other lies dying from wounds
in his bullet-riddled body here
after being chased and trapped
by a large mob. George Grant
was lynched in his cell Monday
after being captured in a near-
by swamp.
His companion, Fred â€œBubber"
Bryant, after evading the mob was
seized Monday night and left for dead
after volleys of shots had been fired
into his body. The dying man was
discovered on the edge of the swamp
early Tuesday morning by deputy
sheriffs.
The deputies returned here and
announced they found Bryant lying
tiend. Coroner Crumley went to get
the body and discovered that the
man was still alive. lle was brought
here and placed in a hospital. State
and county officers are standing
guard to prevent further violence in
the event that the man's condition.
improves.
Trouble began when Grant and
Bryant were stopped and questioned
by a night watchman while they wers
passing a bank, The watchman is
alleged to have attempted to pince
the men under arrest when they re-
fused to answer his questions. He
was shot during the altercation.
Fearing for their lives, Grant and
Bryant sought safety in the swamp.
They were closely pursued by law
officers.
The officers were met with gunfire
when they approached the swamp
and Robert L. Freeman, Darien police
chie. fell dead from a bullet woun 1.
In the encounter R. J. Anderson,
deputy marshal: John Fisher, police-
man, and J. 11. Collins, McIntosh
county deputy sheriff, were wounded
by the concealed men.
Grant was captured by a mob, but
Bryant made his escape. The mob.
driven to fury by the getaway of
Bryant, returned to Darien with
Grant to make arrangements for the
lynching and to permit more detach-
ments of the mob to return for the
Dixie ritual.
After Grant had been placed in his
"death cell" the mob leaders entered
the jail and seized the prisoner with-
out any resistance from police or
deputy sheriffs. Volley after volley
of shots were poured into the man's
yodx.
The volleys brought to an abrupt
end Grant's screams for inercy.
The
mob would not heed the urging of
ol. Roy Neal, in command of the
Savannah guardsmen, to "let this
Negro live until we catch the other
one."
Machine guns were mounted
on the streets and Joe Wages, half-
brother of Freeman, surrounded by
members of the mob, took his stand
in front of the jail to prevent offi-
cers from spiriting Grant away.
The mob then set out with blood-
hounds to seize Bryant, who was still
in the swamp.
"I was lured
by a ruse that
away from the jail
Deputy Collins had
just died. When I learned of the
plan to lynch Grant it was too late
to act. The mob acted before the
national guardsmen could interfere,
as they had gone away after placing
Grant inside the jail." the sheriff is
reported to have said in attempting
to explain why Grant was turned
over to the mob.
More than 200 Georgia guardsmen
were sent here from Savannah short-
ly after the encounter between the
hunted pair and the mob at the edge
of the swamp in which the police
chief was slain and three law officers
wounded. Although Darien

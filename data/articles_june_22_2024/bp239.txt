Retired British Navy Officer
Tells of South African Racism
By D. A. S. Chari D. A. S. Chari
NEW DELHI, India —(ANP)—- Racism has gone crazy in South Africa. Mass lynchi-
ings of Negroes and violent, illegal picketings of shops owned by Indians are being openly
aided and abetted by the Union's white government. Here is what not a biased native
or a prejudiced Indian, but a white citizen of Great Britain has to say about the intoler-
able racial oppression in South Africa.
"A visitor to South Africa." said,
Lt. J. R. B. Towner, a retired royal
navy officer, who is now serving in
the British merchant navy, “is im-
mediately struck by the arrogance
of the European population and the
state of poverty and suppression the
Negro and Indian peoples live in.
Everywhere there are reminders of
the despicable color bar.
DENIED SHORE LEAVE
"The Indian crew 'in my last ship
was not permitted the elementary
privilege of going ashore in Durban.
The crew was also deprived of per-
sonal contacts with their compat-
riots in the port simply becaus
they were non-Europeans.
"The conditions existing there
at present are just those which we
fought the
the war to destroy-a
handful of wealthy people being
able, by brute force, to suppress a
vast majority to their will. Mil-
llons have lost their lives to pre-
vent the perpetuation
abominable
mentality,
of this
and
and we
must see that their sacrifice was
not in vain."
The pity is that there are not
nore such noble-minded white citi-
ens at Lt. Towner.

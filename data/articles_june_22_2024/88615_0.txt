COURTLAND
Negro Constable Allowed Bail on a
Charge of Murder.
Courtland, May 12 .-( Special) -Horace
Jackson, charged with the murder of Doc
Herman, was tried Saturday by Probate
Judge Keempe under a writ of habeas
corpus and admitted to bail in the sum of
$ 1500. Bond has not yet been given but
it is thought the same will be made in
a few days.
Last fall, Alex, alias Doc Herman, was
arrested, charged with the murder of a
negro woman. The crime was particularly
revolting. The woman, who was a
widow, was killed and her body thrown
into a corn crib, which was set on fire,
the crib and contents being consumed.
Herman was arrested and on preliminary
examination, the evidence was so overwhelming
that the defendant was remanded
to jail without bail. All of the
partles were negroes and the prisoner
was placed in charge of a negro constable
, who attempted to carry his prisoner
to the Tuscumbia jail for safe- keeping.
The town was alive with armed negroes
who swore that the murderer should not
be carried away. The constable summoned
a negro, Horace Jackson, to assist
him in putting the prisoner in the train.
The mob rushed on the train and despite
the efforts of the constable and his
posse took the accused, and carrying
him a mile from town hung him. It
was charged that the negro Jackson, instead
of doing his duty as a posseman,
assisted the mob in hanging the prisoner
and he was indicted by the grand jury,
in connection with other members of the
mob. Jackson was the only one of the
indicted men arrested, the others having
left the, and his conviction is
very doubtful country.

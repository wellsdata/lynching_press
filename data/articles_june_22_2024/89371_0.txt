Union Springs, April 2 .-( Special.)- The
negro, Aberdeen Johnson, alias Jack Wal-
ter, who assaulted Mrs. J. J. Butts near
Goshen about three weeks ago, was
lynched near here this afternoon shortly
after 2 o'clock. The deed was done
by a mob of about 35 men from the neighborhood
of Goshen. After Deputy Ritch
had gone to dinner the men covered
Sheriff Jinright with guns and handcuffed
him. They then searched him for
the jail keys. Failing to find these on
his person three of their number went
to W. E. Eatman, a blacksmith, near- by,
and demanded of him the proper tools
for opening the jail doors. Having gotten
these they then marched on the jail and
succeeded in entering ..
After gaining entrance to the cell one
man of the crowd was knocked down by
the prisoner in the scuffle before he was
overpowered. The negro was carried out
the Aberfoll road, south of town, and
strung to a tree about a mile from the
limits of the city. Both ears were cut off
and other mutilations of the body were
made before the crowd began to fire upon
him. The negro was literally riddled.
The negro was caught this morning
about 9 o'clock and lodged in jail. Sheriff
Jinright had hopes of turning him over
to the sheriff of Pike county, but the
mob from Goshen were afraid the gov-
ernor would send out troops on the afternoon
train to convey the man to Mont-
gomery and they did not want to run
any risk of letting him get away from
them.
They stated that they would have preferred
carry him to the scene of his
crime for to the execution.

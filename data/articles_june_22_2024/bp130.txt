Rap Powell
guest speaker in the forum spon-
sored at the church by Congress-
man Powell, titled "Which Way
The Negro?
Mr. X repeatedly emphasized
that Muslims reject integration
into the white American society
because America is doomed,
"plus, we don't think it is within
the nature of the white man to
change in his attitude toward
the black man."
Warning
NEW YORK
"Congressman
Powell should come back from
Puerto Rico and gets the other
three Negro congressmen togeth-
er and demand that the president
launch an immediate `investiga-
tion into the lynching of a uni-
formed Negro soldier in Missis-

He warned the packed church);
not to mistake the political in-|
activity of the Muslims for politi-
-cal ignorance nor lethargy. “The
Muslims and Nationalists are the
balance of power everywhere,]
and are watching and waiting.
"Because a man doesn't throw
a punch, doesn't mean he can't
do so whenever he gets ready.
Don't play the Muslims and
Nationalists cheap; we are for
any black man who wants free-
dom, justice and equality for
black people
but we are
against those Negro leaders who
are afraid to come away from
the white man's plantation."
"Adam Clayton Powell is the
only black politician who has
been able to come off the white
man's plantation, buck the white
political machine downtown, and
still hold his seat in Congress,"
he said.
"But Dr. Powell should always
remember," warned Mr. X, "that
it is the black people of Harlem
who gave him his victories over
the plantation political bosses.
He must always remember that
the black people of Harlem didn't
send him to Congress because
he is an American, but because
he is a black man.
"As long as Dr. Powell speaks
as a black man for the benefit
of black people, the black people
will always send him to Congress
but when he ceases to speak
as a black man for the benefit of
black people, and begins to com-
promise and sympathize with
white people, then the black peo-
ple of Harlem will cease to send
him to Congress," he concluded.

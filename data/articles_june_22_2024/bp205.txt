JUSTICE
The speedy acquittal

strates the ridiculousness of the claims of
Dixie demagogs that the South is capable
of cleaning its own sordid and prejudice-
ridden house without Federal assistance.
Compare the South's action in this
case with the conviction of Mrs. Rosa
Lee Ingram in the self-defense slaying
of a white neighbor, and even the most
hidebound statesrighter must admit that
they refute any possible argument for
leaving the question of Negroes' rights to
"Georgia justice." If one is still doubtful,

Here was a deliberate, cold-blooded slay-
ing of a law abiding Negro. Here again
was the device (which has become popu-
lar in the South of late) of indicting
white criminals and mobsters, then con-
ducting a farcical trial for the purpose
of bolstering the fallacious argument that
the South is solving its own problems.
Despite the increase in the number of
liberal whites in the South, the prevailing
sentiment of that section of the nation is
that the Negro should accupy a position
of inferiority and that he is entitled to no
right that "a white man is bound to re-
spect."
A Southland that, despite its obvious
collective poverty, has been able to afford
the luxury of separate schools, separate
waiting rooms in public places, separate
toilets in parks and roadside inns, should
encourage little sympathy when forced by
the federal government to pay through
its nose the stiff money damages that
should be a part of any forthright federal
anti-lynching bill.
It is obvious that it will be several
generations before the Negro in the South
can expect even-handed justice. Let's in-
sist that the type of Georgia justice meted
out in the Mallard case be as expensive as
possible.
Let's keep pounding upon the doors of
our Congressmen for real action on a
tough anti-lynching bill; CHL.Geeorgia

LYNCH'S LAMP- POST.
A Murderer Taken from Jail and
Hanged by an Iowa Mob.
CHICAGO, Dec. 15.- A special from Des-
Moines, Iowa, says: This morning, about
2:30 o'clock, a body of 150 men, disguised,
entered the jail, knocked down the jailer,
bound him hand foot, took the keys to the
cells from his pocket, overpowered the
guards, and entered the cell where
Charles Howard, a murderer, who was
yesterday, sentenced to imprisonment for
life, was confined. His wife, who was
sleeping with him, uttered horrible shrieks,
and it was only with the force of half a
dozen men that Howard was dragged from
his bed. A rope was placed about his
neck, and he was dragged through the halls
and the court- house yard to a lamp post
and hurg.,

The mob had with this exception undisputed
possession of the city, and commenced
an attack first upon Bates' Ex
change Bank, and after that upon Lou
gee's Exchange Office, both of which
they destroyed, making havoc of every
thing which was at all destructible.
The city council met at 12 o'clock.
But they were unabie, as we learn, to
pass an ordinance for the preservation of
the public peace, eleven votes being ne-
cessaty for this purpose, in consequence
of only eleven members being present,
and one of that number voting against it.
All that could be done was then done,
viz: to pass an order appropriating five
dollars to defray expenses in em-
hundred ploying an extra police.

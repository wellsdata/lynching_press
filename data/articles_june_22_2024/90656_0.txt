Iynching Innocent Men.
The confession of a prisoner shows
that when two lynched
negroes were
recently in West Virginia two innocent
men were put to death. But what do
mobs of lynchers really care whether
or not their victims have been guilty
of any grave offense? The frenzied
passion for murder takes hold of such
rioters as if they were possessed of
devils, and they act as if they were
insane for the glutting of the mad
fury, no matter how free from blame
the objects of their lawless violerte
may be.
Every lyncher in this era of enlight-
enment and progress and in present
conditions in the United States should
be looked upon as a cowardly assassin,
the sort of scoundrel who would lie in
ambush for arty person whom he dis ..
liked and would shoot his enemy in the
back from a secure hiding place without
a sign or a word of warning. Such
dastards never engage in a fair fight.
Anything like an equal contest in any
cricumstances or conditions has no attraction
for them. In fact, such fellows
always run at top speed if they meet
an adversary who desires nothing but
an even chance with them.- New

By ANDREW D. WHITE, Former Ambassador to Germany
HE number of HOMICIDES that are PUNISHED BY
C LYNCHING EXCEEDS THOSE PUNISHED BY due
process of LAW. When we consider that out of every forty-
six homicides committed in the United States ONLY ONE
IN FORTY- FIVE IS LEGALLY PUNISHED, it is no wonder
that people look somewhere else for the solution.
There is nothing more nonsensical or ridiculous than the GOODY-
GOODY TALK ABOUT LYNCHING. Much may be said in favor
of the quotation of the famous Englishman, Goldwin Smith," There
are some communities in the United States in which their lynch law is
better than any other." I HAVE NO SYMPATHY FOR THE
CRIMINAL. My sympathy is for those who will be murdered, for
their families and for their children.
Simply as a matter of fact THE UNITED STATES IS, among
all civilized nations of the world, THE COUNTRY IN WHICH
the crime of MURDER IS MOST FREQUENTLY COMMITTED
AND LEAST FREQUENTLY PUNISHED.
Deaths by violence are INCREASING RAPIDLY. Our record
is now LARGER THAN that of ANY OTHER COUNTRY in
the world.
There is too much OVERWROUGHT SENTIMENTALITY
in favor of the criminal.
IN THE NEXT YEAR 9,000 PEOPLE WILL BE MURDERED. AS
1 @TAND HERE TODAY I TELL YOU THAT 9,000 ARE DOOMED TO
DEATH, WITH ALL THE CRUELTY OF THE CRIMINAL HEART AND
WITH NO REGARD FOR HOME AND FAMILIES, AND TWO- THIRDS
WILL BE DUE TO THE MAUDLIN SENTIMENT SOMETIMES
MERCY. CALLED

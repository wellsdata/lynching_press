FOR BLACKS ARE LYNCHED
Four negroes- Virgil, Tom and Rob-
ert Jones and Joe Ripley- were taken
from jail early in the day and hanged
from a tree on the edge of town. About
fifty men composed the mob and the
people of the town knew nothing of
the lynching before daylight revealed
the bodies. The following note was
pinned on one of the bodies:
" Let this be a warning to you niggers
to let white people alone or you
will go the same way. Hugh
better shut up or quit." Rogers
The negroes who were lynched were
members of a lodge, and at a meeting
recently it is said they approved the
murder of James Cunningham, a white
farmer, by his negro tenant, Rufus
Browder. This murder occurred in the
southern part of Logan county, and it
is supposed here that the mob was
made up of from that part of
the county. men

Lynch Law,
The Sacramento Transcript gives the following
illustration of the operation of Lynch Law
in the New State:
" It seems that a man by the name of De-
vine, residing at Georgetown, had taken to
gambling, and as he was in the habit of losing
his money, his wife hid all that came in her
possession. On Sunday, he got' broke,' he demanded
the money which she had hid. She
refused to deliver it if he intended to use it
in gambling, whereupon Devine threatened to
kill her. As he seized his gun, she blew out
the candle and fled into another room; he how-
discharged it at her. The contents pass-
ever ed through the door and killed her. An en-
raged crowd, several hundred strong, assembled
forthwith, set Devine on a horse and rode
him off to a tree. Here they made him kneel
upon the horse's back, put the rope around
his neck, and drove the horse off, leaving
hanging from the branch of the tree." him

SHORT SHRIFT, LOTS OF LEAD
The Murderer of Mr. Gilchrist Lynched Near
Fort Deposit- The Clever Manner of
His Capture.
Montgomery, June 24 .-( Special.)- Bill
Westmoreland, the negro who murdered
Mr. James Gilchrist near Fort Deposit,
was forcibly taken from a strong guard
at that place last night by a mob of 200
heavily armed men, who rode into town
from Lowndes and Butler counties, and
hanged to a big elm tree in the Gilmer
woods near the cemetery. His body was
riddled with 500 bullets.
This murder was one of peculiar atrocity
, Gilchrist having been murdered because
he refused Westmoreland's wife
unlimited credit at his store. During the
hunt after Gilchrist's slayer every business
man in Fort Deposit closed his
store and joined in the pursuit.
The manner in which Westmoreland
was captured reflects credit upon another
negro as a citizen who wanted crime
punished, no matter by whom committed.
The one- legged negro engineer of the
water pumping station at McGee's
switch effected his capture in the following
manner: He knew that a posse was
in pursuit of Gilchrist's murderer and
seeing a negro coming up the railroad
track with a musket on his shoulder he
accosted him and said:" If you go to
town with that ragged shirt on the police
will arrest you as a tramp; come in
here and let me give you a decent shirt."
The fugitive consented and as he was in
the act of taking the shirt Green knocked
his gun out of his hand and covered him
with it. The murderer then said," I ain't
stole nothing."
" But you have killed somebody," said
Green.
" For God's sake don't let the white
folks know you've caught me I am your
color- turn me loose," said Westmore-
land.
But Green kept him, as a law- abiding
citizen should, until an officer and posse
from McGee's Switch arrived and carried
him to Fort Deposit on a hand car. He
confessed his to them and afterwards
to the guard crime at Fort Deposit.

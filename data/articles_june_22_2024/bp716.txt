Valentine, Neb.-Eunice Murphy, of
this place, the girl accused of having
incited a mob to hang her fiance in
order that she might inherit his life
insurance, has been held for the dis-
trict court. The presiding judge de-
clared that Miss Murphy is just as
guilty as the men who took her sweet-
heart to a tree and hanged him..
Silent to all but her attorneys, de-
spondent, but dry-eyed. Miss Eunice
Murphy is composedly waiting in her
jail cell the day when she shall be
called to trial as accessory to the
atrocious murder of Charles Sellers,
her suitor.
To all appearances an unsophisticat-
ed country girl, the young woman is.
intelligent enough to keep quiet about
her affairs. She is charged with incit-
ing her fiance, George Weed, his.
brother Alma, her cousin and former
fiance, arry Heatb, and her brother,
Kenneth Murphy, to their cruel at-
tack upon a man who had for three
years sought her hand in marriage.
Avarice is alleged as the motive.
Thus are all the elements of a n
drama present in her case.
Tal dg
advantage of them, she might, wk 3.
newspaper interview, clothe herself
with all that morbid glamor so dear to
a sensation-loving public. Yet she
prefers to keep her own counsel, re
fusing to make the simplest state
ments about the affairs and referring!
all questioners to her lawyers.
The hanging of Sellers, June 18, by
some of his neighboring ranchmen
near Cody, Neb., created a sensation
for a time, but when four men charg.
ed with the crime were put in jail and
bound over to the district court, the
excitement subsided. Now it
charged by John M. Tucker, county
attorney, that Miss Murphy incited
and procured the murder of Sellers,
her alleged motive being to get pos-
session of $7,000 of insurance policies
and considerable personal property
which she is said to have believed
would be bequeathed to her upon the
death of Sellers.
At the time of the killing of Sellers,
it was rumored that one man in the
party that hanged him to a telegraph
pole was inspired by jealousy, he be
ing a suitor of the girl.
Hutch Jack and Sellers, who lived
together, were awakened one night by
a knock on the door by George B.
Weed. Jack knew Weed and invited
him into the house. Weed had said
he was making a social call. Weed
asked Sellers, who was in bed in an
adjoining room, to get up and come
into the room where Jack and Weed
were, but Sellers excused himself by
saying he was not feeling well. Fif-
teen minutes later, Jack says, a party.
of men, composed of Kenneth Murphy,
Harry Heath and Alma Weed, came to
the Jack home. They were armed'
and they covered Jack and command-
ed him to remain in the room where
he was. George Weed told Sellers to
get up.
"We are after you," he said, ac
cording to the affidavit of the county Â·
attorney. Sellers arose and
Harry
Heath is alleged to have thrown
rope around his neck and pulled it
tight, and George Weed, Heath, Mur
phy and Alma Weed are charged with
having dragged Sellers out of the
house to a nearby telephone pole and,
hanged him.

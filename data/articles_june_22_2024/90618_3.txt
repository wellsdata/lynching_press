that" thousands of negroes' who tried
to vote in the South just disappeared
from the polls and were never heard of
again and that many were lynched also
because of their desire to vote. Of
course there was not a word of truth in
this statement but it has served one
purpose- it has served to prepare a
very cold reception for candidate
Harding when he invades Dixie
his vote- getting crusade. on

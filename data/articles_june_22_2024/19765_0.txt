Lynch law is dangerous always, and
occasionally, as in Illinois recently, the
wrong man may be tackled by the vigilantes
. A man confined
in jail on
charge of murder was lynched, and it a
now turns out that he was innocent and
the husband of the murdered woman
was the guilty party. The law's delays
are very exasperating at times, but in
end it is safest to let justice take its
the regular course.

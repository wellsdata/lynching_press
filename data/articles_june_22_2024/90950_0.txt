THE WHITE MAN BUTTING IN.
With one white man lynched, his
son in the penitentiary for 21 years,
another to hang in Morrillton, one
bound over for trial at Little Rock,
all for criminal assault, shows that
so far as Arkansas is concerned the
Negro hasn't a monopoly of this diabolical
crime.- Ft. Smith

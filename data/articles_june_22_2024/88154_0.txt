" Nothing but Fun," is the
queer
heading under which a great newspaper
describes a" jubilee day," when
thirty thousand school children of a
Pennsylvania city attended a" Wild
West" show. One of the features of
this performance was a" realistic
lynching." A colored fellow pretended
to steal a horse, was lassoed, dragged
a quarter of a mile over the ground,
and hanged on the gallows; and then
" the cowboys amused themselves firing
at the struggling body, while the
band played' Nearer, My God, to
Thee." It is to be regretted, but hardly
to be wondered at, that the press
generally has refrained from commenting
on this brutal travesty of law
and religion. Journalists probably
feel that words are powerless to characterize
the persons who would put before
children such a degrading
bition. exhi

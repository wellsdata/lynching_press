Southern Journal Standing Straight
Courier Journal Shows Courage of Convictions.
The mob that lynched a[
Negro and his wife near By-
halia. Miss., on suspicion of
burning a planter's barn, was
actuated, we are quite sure,
solely by a desire to protect
the honor of Southern women.
Northern people may wonder
what barnburning has to do
with criminal assaults, but it
is none the less' the usual
crime' where a Negro is concerned
, just as insulting a
white man or striking a policeman
or any offense perpetrated
by a Negro is the' usual
crime' for purposes of immediate
and condign punishment
at the hands of the mob.
" In saying this the World is
well aware that it will be reminded
by forty or more
Southern newspapers that it
is slandering the South and
that it is utterly ignorant of
the conditions of racial relationship
which necessitate the
use of the rope or burning at
the stake to safeguard womanhood
."( New York World.)
The plain truth is, as the
Courier- Journal has often explained
for the benefit of foolish
persons who see in lynching
a serious effort to prevent
crime, that in all mob murders
the element of excitement
- the pursuit of entertainment
- is dominant. Mobs
are not composed of men who
are concerned about the solu-
tlon of the problem of lawless
ness. They are not composed
of men who are habitually
concerned about the protection
of women. Drunken riff-
raff, rallying to indulge in a
lynching, represent nothing
more than the desire for
amusement promotes
fox hunting, cock which fighting and
racing- sports differing, of
course, one from another and
akin to man hunting only in
that they offer excitement.
The fatuous fellow who
spouts about lynch law
criminal assault is dangerous for
to the peace of the community
because his indorsement
of mob murders e..courages
the ruffians who make up
lynching parties. The man
who is willing to join the mob
is merely a cowardly brute
who likes the excitement of
man- baiting where there is
little prospect of interference
at the scene of the contemplated
crime or indictment
afterward for participation.
One determined officer who is
willing to shoot to kill can
turn back a mob of 100" determined
citizens." That is
because lynching is merely a
country frolic, enjoyable only
so long as there is no danger
that anyone save the prisoner
will be hurt.
The Courier- Journal agrees
with the World as to lynching
being always indefensible, but
does not believe that there
are forty Southern newspaper
of any importances in
whose opinion lynching is a
Southern institution worthy
of defense. There may be
forty, or more, ready to point
out that in proportion to the
opportunity provided by the
presence of a mixed population
lynching occurs as often
in the North as in the South,
and that it is punished no
more readily in Pennslvania
than in Mississippi. But credit
should be given to several
States which have taken preventive
measures by enacting
" automatic removal laws" under
which an officer who yields
to a mob loses his office with
out being allowed to raise the
question of whether he was at
fault. Automatic rem oval
laws are in force in only a
few States. Every State should
have such a law, and because
the Southern States, with
their greater Negro population
, stand more in need of
them and have exhibited little
interest in adopting them
they can be justly blamed for
not having exhibited the right
degree of militancy against
mob murder. Kentucky is
among the States that have
neglected to enact the automatic
removal law. Its enactment
is regularly recommend-
ed by the Courier- Journal
when Legislatures convene.
Possibly persisttency may
time be rewarded. in

Shooting Between Whites and

Castleberry, Town Marshal of Pelham, a
village near Thomasville, was fatally
shot last night while trying to arrest a
negro for inciting riot. After Castle-
berry was shot he returned the negro's
fire, and a general shooting began be-
tween whites and blacks, in which a
negro was fatally wounded. Race
trouble seemed imminent for a time
but was averted.,

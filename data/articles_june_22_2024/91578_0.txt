WINONA, MINN., Oct. 28.- A rumor has
.reached here that Palmer, the North Bend
murderer, has been lynched. It is stated
that the officers started with the man
from North Bend for Black River Falls,
but that they were overtaken by a mob of
twenty determined men, who tied a rope
about the murderer's neck and hanged
him from a railway bridge.
Palmer, a young tellow of 18 years,
lived, with a farmer named Marshall, a
-mile and a half from North Bend. He
quarreled with his employer and squared
accounts in a manner most diabolical.
Early in the afternoon he took little Oscar
Marshall, a bright and pretty child of 3
years, out to the barn, where he deliberately
took an ax and brutally pounded in the
child's skull.
Dr. Rhodes was summoned from Gales-
ville, but when he came the child was beyond
human aid and soon died. Upon a
careful search of the premises Palmer was
found in an icebox. He had smeared his
face and lips with carbolic acid and made
them a horrible sight. His eyes were
.shut and he was pretending to have committed
suicide.
His pulse was felt and found to be
normal. He was stood on his feet and
" made to walk. For some time he kept
up his pretended stupor, but finding it
would not work with his enraged captors,
broke down, opened his eyes and confessed
. He admitted that his motive for
killing the child was to get even with
:. Marshall.

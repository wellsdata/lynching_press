Two Cases of Lynch Law.
About a month ago Charley Davis
was lynched at Smithville, Tenn. He
was charged with the customary offense
and it is believed he was guilty
,
of the crime. The girl's father appealed
to his neighbors and relatives
to avenge the crime, and they did it.
Six of the avengers are now in jail
in Nashville charged with the crime
of murder.
They are described as typical farmers
. All are church members, and
some of the six are school directors.
One says he did not take" a prominent
part" in the lynching. One of
the number is the paternal grand
father of the girl on whose account
the lynching took place. He was a
Confederate soldier. The maternal
grandfather is also present, and he,
too, was a soldier of the Confederacy.
He admits that he assisted at the
preparations for the hanging. An uncle
is in jail, too, and he says he was
led into mob violence by the talk of
the father of the girl.
Smithville is in DeKalb County, not
far from Nashville. The doomed man
was taken from the court house. He
was a white man, and he had many
friends, and these friends tried to
lynch the lynchers. This division of
opinion in the county has led to the
arrest of six of the lynchers, and Ten
nessee may also furnish an instance
of the trial and conviction of lynchers
. They will certainly be tried, and
the chances are very good that they
will be convicted. In one respect the
case is not as notable as the one in
Elmore County in this State, because
the lynched man in Tennessee was
white man. But his crime was hein a
ous and diabolical, whereas the
lynched negro in Elmore had injured
no, but had been engaged in a
squabble one over some chickens.

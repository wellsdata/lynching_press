Negroes Press for Convic-
tion of Twelve Lynch-
ing Suspects
OKLAHOMA CITY, Okla., June 16
(ANP. Telegraphic Service).-Twelve
white men have been identified as
members of the mob who recently
lynched Henry Argo, a half-wit youth,
in Chickasha, and Negroes here and
throughout the State are going to see
that every effort is made to convict
them.
This fact became known Sunday
night when a large group of citizens
headed by Dr. W. A. J. Bullock, pres-
ident of the local chapter of the N.
A. A. C. P., assembled in the office of
the Black Dispatch, Roscoe C. Dun-
gee. editor, to formulate definite
plans to aid in the prosecution. This
conference was devoid of oratory

composed of At-
torneys J. Q. A. Harrod and Laynie
Harrod. both veteran criminal law-
yers, will be employed, and the gover-
nor of the State will be petitioned to
change venue as it is not believed
that a conviction can be effected in
Chickasha.
Attorneys here have stated that all
of the rioters are guilty of murder
under the Oklahoma Conspiracy
Statutes and the citizens are deter-
mined that those men whose savagery
caused them to lynch an innocen
youth and cast a blot upon this whol
State be tried and convicted o
murder.
Another important development in
the case centers around the propose
suit by the relatives of the slain bo
for damages against Sheriff Ma
Sankey, white, which will be filed u
the Federal Court. Sankey is charger
with being drunk at the time the bo:
was killed, thereby violating his oath
of office.

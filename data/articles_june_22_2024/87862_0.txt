COLORED PEOPLE
Hold an Interesting Debate at St.
Paul's Church.
Tuesday evening quite a lively
and interesting debate was had by
the colored people at St. Paul's
church in this city. The subject
was:" Resolved, that in order to
annihilate the mob or lynch law the
negro should split his yote or vote
with the white people of the South."
The affirmative side was represented
by W. H. Hall and J. U. Wilson, and
the negative side by --- Billingsley
and Dr. Reed. The debate was a
heated one and much feeling was
manifested on both sides. The negative
side wor. The affirmative side,
however, made a strong and creditable
effort. The nature of the subject
afforded the negative the ad
vantage. The colored people are
naturally Republicans, and the
question whether they shall vote
with the white people of the South
-the Democratic ticket- is zot one
calculated to meet with their approval
. Hall and Wilson, however,
are said to have put up a strong argument
in favor of this move. They
said they lived here in the South,
their interests were identified with
the interests of the white people of
the South, and why should they
vote with the Republicans of the
North, who had no interest in
whatever. them

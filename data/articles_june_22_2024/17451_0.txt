HUGHES ACQUITTED.
LYNCHING TRIAL
VERSAILLES IS ENDED.
The Attorney General's View- Says
That From all the Evidence Obtalin
able the Victims Must Have Broken
Jail and Hanged Themselves- Per
jury Charges Are Threatened.
CROSS PLAINS, Ind., March 2.- The
trial of Hez. Hughes, superintendent
of the reform school at Plainfield, on
the charge of being implicated in the
lynching at Versailles, has ended in a
verdict by Justice Craig acquitting Mr.
Hughes from any participation in the
affair. The courtroom was crowded
during the proceedings. The defendant's
attorneys were Rebuck, Cravens and
Thompson. The state's attorneys were
Attorney General Ketcham and H. D.
McMullen.
The state harped a great deal on the
testimony of Charles Kelly, whom they
had brought from the reform school at
Plainfield. The past character of Kelly
it was laid before
defend
as
went decidedly in favor of the
ant.
While the arguments of Messrs.
Cravens and Rebuck were strong and
impressing, that of Marion Thompson
was most effective.
Probably the most sensational part
of the argument was Mr. Thompson accusing
Governor Mount and Attorney
General Ketcham of bringing Kelly here
to testify against Hughes on the promise
of giving him his liberty from the
reform school. Mr. Ketcham denied
this.
Squire Cralg said in his decision in
the case of the state of Indiana against
Hezekiah Hughes for murdering Henry
Schuter in the Versailles jail on the
night of Sept. 14, 1897:" I was in
the late war, saw men wounded, bleed
and fall dead upon the battlefield, but
this is the hardest task that has ever
befallen me. While I believe that 200
men in the mob are guilty of lynching
the five men in the Versailles jail, I
must and do declare, according to testimony
given in this case, that Heze
kiah Hughes is not guilty."
Attorney General Ketcham, after the
decision, was at once driven to Dills
boro to catch a train to Indianapolis,
where he will report to the governor.
In an interview while en route he said:
" It is evident from all the evidence obtainable
that the five men broke jail
and hung themselves."
The militia has been called in, and
their presence in Versailles has never
been needed. Hughes is receiving congratulations
from his friends from all
quarters. It is not known what the
next move of the governor will be, but
it is supposed he will not do anything
for awhile at least. Rumors that the
governor would prosecute witnesses
perjury have not been verified. for

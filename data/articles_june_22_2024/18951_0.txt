Atrocities in Mississippi.
The following is a copy of a part of a private letter
written from a colored resident in the northern
part of Jefferson county, Miss., to a friend in this
city, dated December 11, 1879:
MY DEAR FRIEND: Having heard nothing from
you for a long time, I have concluded to drop you
a line. How long I will be permitted to do so God
only knows, Poor John Graham was taken from
the county jail, and by a mob. Graham( colored)
had some trouble with Jack Coob( white), and Coob
beat Graham with sticks as long as he wanted to;
then went after his gun, swearing he would kill
him, so Graham caught up a spade lying in the
gin- yard and run after Coob, caught him and killed
film with the spade and fled for his life, but was
soon captured and taken to jail. The next night a
mob of about 100 armed men called on the sheriff
of the
county, who gave up the keys to
the mob. He was taken out and hanged
that night. This was done in the face of the
Circuit court, as the court was in session at the
time. A few days since the bulldozers of Copiah
county killed Henry Blackburn former postmaster
of Brookhaven, Miss. He was charged
,
with advising
his colored friends to go to Kanans after seeing
that they would come out as usual, after working
hard all the year and would get no pay from this
righteous people, who boast much about the great
love and interest they feel for the wellfare of the
negro, work him hard all the year, and if he calls
for his pay or tells his friends to let us go to Kan-
sas he is killed, and yet negroes are advised to stay.
" How long, oh Lord, how long" wilt Thou let the
blood of those poor defenseless people cry to
Heaven to avenge the terrible outrages inflicted
fenseless and dependent and despised God
only knows. race

GEORGIA NEGROES IN
MOB LYNCHES THREE
ATLANTA, Ga., Feb. 11.- A telephone
message at midnight from Losburg, in
the southern part of the State, says a mob
took Cupid Redding and two unknown
negroes from the jail there to- night and
lynched them. The prisoners were delivered
after a short parley with the Sheriff
and the mob at the jail. The prisoners
were secured and, according to the telephone
advices, the mob started for the
woods with them.
Governor Candler to- night- ordered a
company of State militia from Albany
to Losburg to prevent, if possible, the
lynching of a negro at the latter place.
It was reported to the Governor by the
Sheriff of Lee County that a party of
lynchers would take the late night train
at Smithville and come to Losburg for
the purpose of lynching the negroes.
Governor was not informed of the ne-
groes' names, but was told that they had
been arrested and jailed at Losburg during
the afternoon.
The black men lynched are believed to
have been concerned in the assault upon
Mrs. Roney, which was one of the most
atrocious crimes of the century. In De-
cember the house of John Roney, a school
teacher, was entered by Cupid Redding
and two companions. The leader of the
black trio ordered Roney to hold out his
hands and, he tied them behind his back,
after which they bound him to a box. The
negroes then ransacked the house, and,
having completed this part of their work,
Redding attacked Mrs. Roney in sight
her helpless and infuriated husband. of

DUG THEIR OWN GRAVES.
Two Negroes Lynched in Mississippi,
After Excavating Sepulchres.
Memphis, Feb. 17.- A report reached
here today of the lynching of two ne-
groes, near Webb City, a remote village,
near Greenville, Miss., a week ago. The
negroes attacked the house of a white
man and burned it to the ground. The
inmates of the house escaped the flames,
and carried with them a trunk containing
$ 800. The negroes seized the trunk
and made way with it. They were captured
soon afterward by a posse, and ordered
to dig their own graves. After
completing the gruesome work the ne-
has
groes were lynched. The matter
been kept very quiet, and details
meagre, no names being obtainable. are

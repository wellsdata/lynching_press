Arrested by Mayor.
Slater was arrested at Wilmar this
morning by Mayor L. E. Dunlap and
former City Marshal Frank Owens of
Wilmar. He was placed in jail with
three other negroes. The woman who
was attacked pointed out Slater as her
assailant when the four were brought
before her.
A short time later Sheriff H. C.
Burks and two deputies left Monticello
in an automobile with the prisoner.
They had planned to take him to Pine
Bluff for safe- keeping. However ..
about two miles out of town they were
met by about 50 armed men who announced
their intention of lynching
Slater. The officers decided to return
the prisoner to Monticello and to summon
extra guards to protect him.
Reaching the jail the officers found
a large crowd had gathered. They
locked the prisoner in a cell and Sheriff
Burks started to leave town, carrying
the keys with him. He was stopped
of the mob however and
by members,
,
informed that if he refused to turn
over the keys the jail doors would be
battered down. He surrendered the
, but pleaded with leaders of the
keys mob not to lynch the negro.

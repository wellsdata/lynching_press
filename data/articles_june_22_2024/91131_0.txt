of the guilty parties and laws to
prevent the recurrence of mob

" GEORGIA'S SHAME."
Atlanta" Constitution" Says State
In Disgraced.
ATLANTA. Aug. 17.- Under the title
Georgia's Shame" the Atlanta Consti-
fution will say to- morrow in part:
The sovereignty of the State of Geor-
has been assaulted and desecrated.
No word in the language is too strong
to apply to the deliberate and carefully
conspired deed of the mob.
" Every man. woman and child in
Georgia will feel the ultimate effect of
that act of law- defying mob, which went
to Milledgeville and lynched not Leo
Frank, who is only a detail in the awful
story, but the State itself. It is
Georgia. Georgia law and justice, that
was hanged upon that Cobb county tree.
" Those State authorities responsible
for prison safety should have known
the attempt would probably be made.
It was their sworn duty to go to every
necessary extent to prevent that act of
violence in which Georgia's shame is
now indelibly written.
" Georgia owes it to herself and to
her future to go to the bottom of this
tragedy and not to rest until she erases
that stain in so far as it is possible for
official effort to wipe it out."
EDITORS BLAMED.
Macon" Telegraph" Doubts
Lynchers Will Be Apprehended.
MACON, Ga., Aug. 17.- The Frank case
has come to an end, olimactic, catas-
trophical, stunning." says the Macon
Daily Telegraph in its final editorial on
that case, which will appear to- morrow
morning. It says in part:
" The shocking ease with which a score
of men raped the State penitentiary, the
warden of which has boasted that' only
Von Kluck and his forty- two centimeters
could ever take that bastile,' demands instant
and vigorous attention.
" It is said every effort will be made
to apprehend these men. Doubtless they|
can be apprehended- doubtful they will.
" Four publications in particular, several
Governors, not a few Northern delegations
invading Georgia, many editorials
in prominent publications outside
the State by editors who were not informed
initiated the feeling of resentment
in Georgia.
" Thomas E. Watson, through the medium
of his monthly and weekly publications
, widely read in Georgia, vigorously
contended that the jury was right and
that Frank was guilty- that he should
hang. He made out an infinitely more
impressive case for the State than Dor-
sey ever did. Attacks were made on
him by the outside press, notably by
Puck, and because the New York Times
and the New York World, Jewish owned,
also made such a tremendous fight for
Frank, aided by Collier's Weekly, attacking
the State and declaring Frank was
convicted because of anti- Semitic feeling
rather than the evidence, Watson accepted
the Semitic challenge thus tarown
down and in a very few weeks the State
was seething.
" That Frank's commutation was secured
by the use of money, and money
alone, the majority of the people of
Georgia believe.
" These things in their minds, the
thirty- five Cobb county men who lynched
Leo Frank went ahead with their work
with clear consciences.
They really believed
they were avenging angels."
" LAW OR ANARCHY?"
Augusta" Chronicle" Editor Wires
His Indignation From New York.
AUGUSTA, Aug. 17.- Thomas W. Loy-
less, editor of the Chronicle, wired the
following editorial from New York tonight
on the Frank lynching:" Law or
Anarchy- Which?
There can be but one answer to this
latest assault on the authority and integrity
of Georgia.
The decency and elvilization of our
State must at last assert itself or else
pull up stakes and quit. It is a straight
out issue between law and anarchy; let
Georgians choose for themselves.
" This climax was inevitable as long
as we permitted incendiary publications
to set Georgia aflame. Tom Watson has
cost Georgia more than 10,000 good and
true men can rebuild in twenty years.
" Those who are disposed to temporize
with this situation further will be as
guilty of Georgia's disgrace and retrogression
as the mob itself."

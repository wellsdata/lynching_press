NEGRO IS LYNCHED.
Who Killed Thurston McGee Is
Man Taken By South Carolina Mob.
Charleston, S. C., June 30.- Cairo
Williams, the negro who killed Thurs-
ton O. McGee, white, at Scranton, in
Williamsburg county, last February,
was taken from the Atlantic Coast
Line train at Scranton this evening
and lynched. Williams narrowly escaped
lynching immediately after the
killing, and was spirited off to the
penitentiary in Columbia for for safekeeping
, and the mob was greatly enraged
thereat.
Last Monday Williams was brought
from Columbia to Kingstree, the county
seat, for trial. The result was a
mistrial, and the sheriff thought it
best to send him back to Columbia for
safe- keeping. As the train approached
Scranton a mob of lynchers, with
blackened faces and wearing masks,
flagged it down with a red flag and
searcehd the train for the negro, to
the great terror of the passengers.
Finally they found Williams and ordered
the sheriff's deputies to deliver
him up. This was refused, and a
scuffle ensued in which the deputies
were much bruised. The mob then
took the negro away, saying that he
would be dead in five minutes, and
that was his, although the exact
particulars are fate not available.

NEW YORK, March 31.- The Italian
paper Il Progresso Italo Americano, referring
to the recall of Baron Favia,
says:" It is but the natural consequence
of the opprobrious manner in which
Louisiana answered Secretary Blaine;
of the weakness of the Supreme authority
in the face of the arrogant bearing
of Governor Nichols; of the infamous
action taken to prosecute the leaders of
the mob who lynched Italian citizens."
The editorial further declares that the
constitution of the United States is
ridiculous in according to the central
power at Washington authority to make
treaties, without, in case of violation by
any State, having force compel that
State to maintain its obligation. Thus
the constitution of the United States
sets a trap into which European Governments
inay fall, and promises what
it cannot fulfill
In conclusion. it says Italy has done
its duty.

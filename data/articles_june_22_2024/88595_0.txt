Supremacy of the Law.
Governor Jelks and Judge Pelham
were mistaken in their estimate of St.
Clair County. That county is not unanimously
made up of law- abiding people.
There are many good people in it, who,
like the heroic Mr. Garrett, believe that
law and order should be maintained at
all hazards and in all emergencies; but
there are also in the county many peo-
pie whose respect for law is not overwhelmingly
great. Many of the latter
gathered at Ashville on Thursday and
attempted to take the convicted prisoner
from' the hands of the sheriff under
the eyes of Judge Pelham in the
court house.
Sheriff North aid his duty, and the
State of Alabama stands today unsullied
by a crime committed against
law and order in a court house itself.
Whatever mistake had been made by
tue higher authorities, Sheriff North
made none. He saw his duty and did
it, and he was nobly backed by Judge
Pelham and Jy good citizens of St.
Clair County to whom the honor and
good name of the county were very
dear.
The best people of St. Clair County
have done the State a great service,
for they have shown that it is possible
to punish a criminal in a case of extreme
brutality by and through the
methods of law. They have shown
that law and order can be maintained
by the sheriff if he be a man of courage
, and that such a sheriff can command
the support of the best men in
a county.
No one deserves higher praise, not
even Sheriff Nora, than James L. Gar-
rett, the father of the unfortunate
young lady. His appeal to the people
should be taken home in every county
of this State. It was an appeal for the
supremacy of law from the heroic
neart of a sorely- stricken man. Even
the men who came for the purpose of
overriding the law were moved by it,
and they left the court house, but evil
spirits were at work, and the mob returned
, but they were met by Sheriff
North, and the prisoner was saved to
the course of the law, and
escaped another crime. Alabama

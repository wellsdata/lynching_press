YOUR SHOTGUN
SHOULD BE USED
ON LYNCHERS
Wewoka, Okla., Nov. 14.â€”John Cud-
jo, who killed Deputy Sheriff John
Dennis in this county last week, was
captured and brought here and a mob
hanged him to a telephone pole. His
body was afterwards riddled with shot
and dedicated to Governor Cruce.
Such a demoralizing effect has this
hanging had upon the Negroes here
that they are asking, "Are we human
beings? Shall we stand for men to
be hanged and shot down like dogs,
or shall we do like the Jones boys of
Mississippi?"
Race men of Oklahoma must no
longer stand for one of their number
to be riddled with shot. Such acts are
too barbarous to go on without a pro-
test-not of words, but of manly de-
fense. Not only was the race insult-
ed, humiliated and dishonored, but the
governor.
If the state does not protect its citi-
zens it is now time for them to pro-
tect themselves.
The rights of every people have been
secured only through bloodshed. Shall
the Afro-Americans of this state con.
tinue to be strung up in front of court-
houses and show no fight? For the
honor of the race and our family, the
future prosperity of our children, it
behooves us to remain silent no longer,
but to take to arms if necessary for
our own protection. Such nefarious
acts have gone on too frequently, and
the "law" has merely winked. We
have determined not to take it any
longer, and hereafter Negroes of this
section are going to fight or die.

DUTY P.'S NEGRO K.
( Washington, Bee.)
Late last Monday night S.
Supreme Grand
W. Green,
Chancellor of the Colored
Knights of Pythias for the
United States, was taken from
a Pullman car on which he
was riding through Florida,
by a mob bent on lynching him
for persisting in exercising his
rights under the law. And
but for the effective interference
of the sheriff he would
have been lynched. As it was
he was lodged in jail over
night and
"
for" safe keeping
,
the next morning heavily fined
for" violation" of the odious;
unjust jim- crow law. Supreme
Grand Chancellor Green was
heavily fined, but the white
law violators who forcibly took
him from the Pullman, and
who would have lynched him,
went free.
In Florida Justice is dead.
As unjust as the jim- crow
car laws are in the Southern
States they provide for" equal"
accomodations for the Negro
passenger. In absence of a
separate Pullman to accom-
odate Negro passengers any
fair man or court would interpret
the law sa to give them
the right to occupy the Pull-
man attached to the train, es-
pecially as inter- state passengers
, which Mr Green no
doubt wos. The law providing
for" equal" accomidations
is mandatory on the statute
books, but it seems it is option-
al with the Negro- hating administers
of the law.
The colored Knights is an
organization with secret signs
and pass word, and it is an or-
ganization with nearly three
hundred thousand members,
and with a plethotic purse. if
this great organization does
not exhaust every resource to
have punishment inflicted upon
the members of the mob
which so roughly and unjustly
treated their Supreme Grand
Chanceller then that organiz-
jation ought to abandon its
secret signs, grip and pass
word; consign its ritual to the
flames, and content itself with
being a benevolent organiza-
tion pure and simple, and not
pretend to be a" secret"
fraternity.
When Negroes of the standing
of Mr. Green cannot travel
unmolested by a mob, and are
fined because of having been
molested almost to the point
of being lynched by a mob, if
the officers of the law will not
the
pursue and prosecute
members of the mob, then it
is high time for a Negro
organization to act. secret

Swears in Special Deputies.
Sheriff Horner yesterday afternoon
swore in ten special deputies for use
during the lynching trial and said that
he is prepared to swear in twenty- five
or thirty more. It was announced by
the sheriff that there would probably
be special deputies on duty by
Monday 100, when the hearing is resumed.

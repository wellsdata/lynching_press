Arrested For Criminal Assault.
DELPHI, Aug. 16 .-[ Special.]- Perry L. Gil-
lam, a renter on a farm six miles north of this
place, was arrested yesterday on a charge of
criminal assault upon Mrs. Farmleman. He
waived examination and was bound over to the
next term of court, in default of which he was
returned to the jail. This man, a year and a
half ago, was arrested on charges similar, and
after three trials- the jury failing each time to
agree- was dischargod. The opinion then was
that he was guilty in the former case, and the
repetition of his act convinces everybody that
he is now guilty. The evidence is sufficient to
conviet. The of the people is intense
and lynching is feeling not an improbability.

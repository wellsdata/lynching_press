LYNCHING. AGAINST LAW
Illinois has a new law providing that
when a sheriff permits a prisoner to be
taken from him by a mob he shall be
immediately removed fdom office. It
under this law that Governor
was
Deener removed from his position the
sheriff of Alexandria county for permitting
the lynching of the negro and
white man in Cairo. It would seem in
this instance the sheriff did all that
laid in his power to protect his prisoner
, but he lost him to the mob and
the law is strict. He tried to take him
from the city, but found the railroad
stations in the hands of mobs; he tried
to take him across the country, but
found that the mobs were scouring the
woods. He found it impossible to purchase
food or to hire a rig, and finally
was come upon when he and his pris-
were fatigued with the hardships
oner they had undergone.

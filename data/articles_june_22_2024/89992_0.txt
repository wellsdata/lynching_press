Great Excitement in Deadwood.
DEADWOOD, Dak., August 28.- Great excitement
prevailed yesterday in Sturgis, the
scene of the lynching of Ross Hallis, the colored
soldier, assassin of Dr. Lynch. A number
of the colored soldiers of Fort Meade,
members of the Twenty- fifth United States
Infantry, armed themselves and proceeded
to the town of Sturgis, threatening to burn
the place. On being informed of the trouble
General Sturgis, commanding at Fort
Meade, detailed a patrol of the Seventh Cavalry
, which scoured the town, capturing and
returning the disaffectants the post immc-
diately after the burial of Dr. to Lynch.

badly as ever.
-Mr. Willard, an auctioneer of St. Joseph,
Missouri, was seized by a party of men, on the$
27th ult., who carried him to the woods, tied him
to a tree, and whipped him to death. The body
was discovered in the afternoon, and three men,
named Langton, Jones, and Anderson, found near
the spot, were arrested and lodged in jail. Mr.
Willard was accused contracted debts,
with the intention not of having to pay them. Great excitement
prevailed. The jail was guarded
to prevent the mob from lynching strongly the prisoners.

LAWLESSNESS, CALIFORNIA DEBATE
SAN FRANCISCO
- Central fig-
ures in the aftermath of th lynching
of Thomas Thurmond
and John
Holmes
Governor Rolph and
are
Former President Hoover. Following
the release of a statement in which
the former President and twenty-
five other prominent citizens deplored
the lynching and attacked
the Covernor's
approval. Rolph
replied" The criticism of the former
President recalls the shooting which
occurred near the White House at
the time of the Bonus March. I
have never forgotten that tragedy
with its mowing down of marchers
in the streets of Washington. That
was the thought uppermost in my
mind when I declined to order out
the National Guard at San Jose.
There was no shedding of innocent
blood in San Jose. Compare that
to the situation developed near Mr.
Hoover's White House". Hoover in
direct reply said" One trouble with
Governor Rolph's statement is his
gross ignorance of facts. Not a
single shot was fired. Not a single
person was injured by the troops
called out in Washington in response
to the appeal of local authorities
. The troops entered the blood
shed which was then in
progress
through the conflict between the
rioters and police. The issue here
is plain and not to be obscured by
such a misstatement. The Governor
has been advocating lynch law. It is
a subversion of the very spirit of
organized society. It is unamerican,
it is a reflection on the State of
California, it is not supported by
citizens." its

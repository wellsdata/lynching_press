KEY WEST. Fia., June 25.- This
city was virtually in the hands of a
negro mob mob last last night night,, and and a a white
citizen was killed by the mob. At 4
p. m. yesterday Silvanus Johnson,
with assault on a white
charged
woman, Mrs. Margaret Atwell, was
conducted to the court house for a
hearing. The courtroom was crowded
and C. B. Pendleton, a well known
citizen, rose and seked:" Are there
enough white men present to hang
the negro?"
There was a chorus of" Yes," and
the crowd closed in on the prisoner.
The sheriff and, his deputies drew
their revolvers and held the crowd at
bay, while Johnson was at once bur-
rled back to jail. A big mob gathered
in from of the building, and one of the
negroes cried out to lynch Pendleton,
a rush was made for bla.

Through the efforts of himself and
friende, Pendleton made his escape in
a carriage.
The negro mob then gathered about
the jail building to prevent the lynching
of Johnson, and open threats were
made by them to kill any white man
that might come to the jail. About 11
o'clock last night William Gardiner, a
white man, was sitting in front of the
courthouse, when several of the negro
mob approached him and ordered him
to move. He arose to obey, and as soon
as his back was turned there rang out
the crack of a number of rifles, and
Gardiner received a mortal wound,
from which he died two hours later.
The whites are inclined to avenge
Gardiner's deato, and another attempt
to lynch Johnson is expected to Le
maue tonight. A serious conflict between
the whites and the blacks is
leared.
The militia is in readiness for any
disturbance, having been ordered out
by the governor, and the United
troops are at' the orders of the
States sheriff.

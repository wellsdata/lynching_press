DETAILS OF THE AFFAIR.
JOHNSON CITY, Tenn., Jan. 4- The
facts which led up to the terrible lynching
affray in Bakersville, N. C., are as
follows: Aaron Wiseman and Calvin
Snipes were partners in an illicit distillery
in Mitchell county, N., and
told William Osborne and Isaac Osborne,
two brothers, where their distillery was
situated. William Osborne reported
officials and
helped
to the
them to destroy it. Wiseman
and Snipes suspected Isaac Osborne as
the reporter. On the night of August
27, 1892, armed with Winchesters, they
went to Isaac Osborne's house and,
calling him to the door, opened fire,
almost riddling him with bullets. Wise-
man and Snipes, were arrested, but sufficient
evidence could not be obtained
against Wiseman and he was released.
Snipes was bound over to the superior
court on purely circumstantial evidence.
He was placed in jail and after being
confined about two weeks confessed to
the killing in the manner above related.
When Wissman heard this he left the
country. Ever since the murder the
brothers of the dead man have been
untiring in their efforts to arouse the
public to vengeance. For several days
the sheriff was kept fully informed, and
he selected 20 of the most determined
guarding
men the county to assist him in
the prisoner in his charge. A
email party attempted to storm the jail
Monday night, but they were easily
beaten back by the sheriff and posse.
The Osbornes redoubled their effe in
Tuesday, and by couriers succeeded in
getting a mob of nearly 400 men together
near the little city. The sheriff,
knowing what was coming, doubled the
number of guards, saw that their arms
were in perfect order, and took every
precaution to beat off the attack.
It was after midnight when the mob
was ready to move upon the jail. Fir-
ing commenced soon after, and a pitched
battle followed immediately between
the mob and the deputies. Almost at
the first volley William Osborne, who
led the attack, was killed. In a few
moments John Osborne also fell dead.
The battle raged until 11 o'clock, nearly
half the number of deputies had fallen
dead and several others were badly
wounded. Then tho mob, with a yell of
triumph, entered the jail, battered down
the cell door and led the unhappy Snipes
his doom. 10
away
He was given no chance to say a word,
but was riddled with bullets from a hundred
weapons.
Members of the sheriff's posse were
killed as follows: J. N. Williams, E. N.
Jones, P. B. Sams, R. E. Johnson, Wm.
Reed, T. N. Becker, J. W. Laws, H. R.
Pannell, G. N. Hallifield, Tom Hall.
The names of those of the mob who
were killed are: John Work, William
Osborne, T. G. Bailiff, Will Perry, John
Osborne, Phil Crewer, Jim Nance, Will
Butler, X. Hagey Dird, Owen Thomas,
Jack Phillips and several others whose
names are not known at present.

At 30 others are
wounded, some of whom will the, but
is impossible to obtain the names tonight
.
The mob is still under arms, but in
spite of the intense excitement, it is
not believed there will be any more
bloodshed unless a call is made upon
the governor for troops. If troops are
summoned every mountain moonshiner
for miles around will assemble to repulse
them, as the people have little respect
for anything but local law, but
will resent outside attempts to force
them into submission. So far as they
are concerned the case is closed, as both
the sheriff's posse and the mob are regarded
as having done their duty
dying with their boots on. in

[Syracuse (N. Y.) Herald) Syracuse( N. Y.) Herald)
Canadian writers frequently criticize the
United States for its alleged attitude toward
the Negro. When some infuriated, lawless.
insane southern mob stages a lynching, out
come the fountain pens. By some of these
observers Americans seem to be regarded as
a people who do not resent these brutalities
quite as sincerely as others.
Today these writers who enjoy their play-
boy hours at our expense but who have no
conception of the thought that is being de-
voted in the United States to the Negro grob-
lem, have a little hometown material.
Recently announcement was made that a
Chicago organization . intended to build 2
home for aged and poor Negroes at Ancaster,
in the province of Ontario. As soon as that
fact was broadcast the Ancaster neighborhood
went into the same kind of a color fog that
is often encountered among the bogs and
bayous of poor white districts in the South.
A fiery cross was burned on a nearby hill
as warning that Ancaster citizenry would not
be imposed upon. Members of the township
council, meeting in the shadow of the smoke
that wreathed upward from the blazing cross,
voted unanimously for a new village by-law to
prohibit construction or maintenance of any
variety of private hospital in Ancaster.
Of course that bars the Chicago organiza-
tion's program. The home for aged Negroes
will have to be erected elsewhere. Where
that will be no one knows at present. Doubt-
less other Canadian townships will follow An-
caster's lead.
When the Canadian writers pen their next
story of the admittedly crude way in which
the people of many sections of the United
States deal with the Negro, they might also
make at least brief mention of the Ancaster
exclusion policy. with its fiery crosses and
special acts of the township council.

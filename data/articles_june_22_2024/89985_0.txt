TRAIN- WRECKERS LYNCHED,
Terrible Fate of Train- Wreckers at Purvis,
Mississippi.
CHATTANOOGA, Tenn., Dec. 28.- On the
night of the 22d inst. the fast passenger
train on the New Orleans and Northeastern
Railroad, between New Orleans and Atlanta,
while running at the rate of forty miles an
hour, was wrecked near Parvis, Miss., by an
obstruction placed on the track by wreckers.
Robert Turner, of Cincinnati, and his fireman
were crashed to death by being bruised
beneath the tender.
Tom Griff, detective for the road, was sent
to work up the case, and he soon had reasons
to suspect three men, and they were arrested
and placed in jail at Parvis. They were
charged with the crime and finally confessed,
stating that they thought it was a freight
train and desired to wreck it in order to
steal what they wanted for Christmas. They
did not intend to wreck the passenger train,
and were sorry it was done. They also expressed
contritlon at the death of Turner
and his fireman. They stated that they
wrecked a freight train at the same place for
the same purpose about a year ago. The news
of the arrest was kept very quiet, but soon
became common talk among railroad men.
About 12:30 o'clock yesterday morning
fifty railroad men, including conductors,
engineers, firemen, brakemen and section
men, boarded the South- bound train at
Meridian. The train stopped at Purvis, and
the crowd got off and proceeded at once to
the jail, where they battered down the door
with axes and sledge hammers. The prisoners
, amid piteous appeals for mercy, were
led out and ropes placed around their necks.
Their cries for mercy were to no purpose.
They were dragged to a point near the scene
of the wreck and swung up to trees, where
their dead bodies were found dangling in the
air this morning. It was about 2 o'clock
when the terrible work of the lynchers was
completed, and as the last man was
off the mob stole quietly away. swung

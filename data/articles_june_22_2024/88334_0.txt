Fort Smith, Ark. The mob that
lynched Bob Turner, the Eufaula,
Okla., negro, at Muldrow, Okla., after
he had killed George Cason, a white
farmer, and attacked his wife, will
not be punished. Both District Judge
John Pitchford of Tahlequar and
County Attorney J. E. Shackleford of
Sallisaw, declared they would take no
further cognizance of the affair, and
as far as they are concerned the matter
is closed.
Both declared emphatically that
they were in sympathy with the work
of the mob and that the lynching was
justifiable. The two officials also declared
if there were any prosecutions
as a result the lynching the prosecutions
would of be instigated by some
" Members of Mob May Rest in Peace
So Far as I am Concerned,"

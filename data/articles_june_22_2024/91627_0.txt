A Murderous Affray.
FRISCO( Utah), via Salt Lake, September
: 8th.- Henry Rice arrived here yesterday
a buckboard from Spring Valley,
on southeastern Nevada, bringing news of the
killing, at 11 o'clock on the night of the 4th
instant, of a man named Coffee by Lew Carpenter
at Panacea. The killing was the result
of a horserace dispute, and is considered a
willful murder. The altercation was over a
race proposed between Carpenter's Selkirk
and Dan Neiswanger's Desert colt, for$ 500
a side,$ 250 forfeit. Coffee, Desert's backer,
drew out and paid the forfeit promptly.
Carpenter wanted a race, and followed
Coffee all the abuse,
evening with
and at 11 o'clock began shooting. Coffee
returned the fire, each sending three shots,
all Coffee had in his pistol, which he then
threw at Carpenter. He ran, bleeding, to a
ballroom, where Carpenter overtook him and
knocked down and jumped upon the dying
man. The murderer narrowly escaped lynching
by the efforts his friends and the fleetness
of their horses of.

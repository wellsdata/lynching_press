APPEASED COURT IS THE
THE UNITED STATES Supreme Court has sent a Tennessee
sheriff and several other citizens to jail for three months for contempt
of court, for permitting the lynching of a Negro whom the court had
decided should have a new trial on a charge upon which he had been
unfairly convicted. The sheriff and his companions fought longer and
harder to save themselves from jail than they did to save the life of
the Negro. But when they found that a large and comfortable apart-
ment had been provided for them in the federal prison at Washington,
where they can loaf, read, smoke, eat and take things easy, they were
reconciled, and awaited with interest the issuance of the President's
Thanksgiving proclamation. The dignity of the court is thus appeased
The Negro is now out of its jurisdiction..

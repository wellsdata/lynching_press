DOROTHY CANFIELD FISHER
SAYS LYNCHINGS DISCREDIT
UNITED STATES IN EUROPE
NEW YORK, Nov. 5.- The United
States is discredited and disgraced in
Europe by lynchings, according to a
letter written by Dorothy Canfield
Fisher, the novelist, and made publicate
today by the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People
Mrs. Fisher, writing to Senator Dil-
lingham in favor of a congressional
investigation of lynching, says that
in her three years in France she observed
" the astonished, amazed abhorrence
which American lynching causes
everywhere in Europe."
Her letter follows:
Arlington, Vt., Oct. 24.
My Dear Senator Dillingham:
I am writing you as a Vermonter
much interested in the Negro question
to beg you to use all your influence
for a favorable action on the
Curtis resolution calling for an investigation
of lynching and mob violence.
I have no need to say anything to you,
of course, about the horrible wrongs
involved in letting lynching go on, as
you must know more about that than
we do, and must feel quite as deeply
as all the rest of the Vermonters who
are looking anxiously for your action
in the matter. But as one just returned
from three years in France, I
can perhaps present to you from much
first- hand experience some idea of the
astonished, antazed abhorrence which
American lynching causes everywhere
in Europe. The whole nation is discredited
and disgraced and every word
we say about human rights and civilization
is laughed at by Europeans
who know of the lynching evil in our
country.
It would to some extent redeem our
national honor- even before the federal
investigation could actually accomplish
anything, to have it known
that we took the disgrace seriously
enough to take national action
about it.
With the keenest hope that you may
be instrumental and Vermont through
you, in helping put an end to this national
horror, I am,
*
Sincerely yours,
( Signed)
CANFIELD FISHER.

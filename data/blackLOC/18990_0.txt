Due Partly To
Lynching- Tobias
New York, Jan. 4.- That the

States which caused Colonel
Charles Lindbergh and his family
to flee from the United States
for safety is caused in part by

America has accepted the brutal
lynchings of scores of Negroes annually

sent copies of the leaflet recently
published by the NAACP
containing a photograph of the
lynching of Rubin Stacy at Fort
Lauderdale Florida in which well

lynching bill was proposed for
passage," is responsible for the
growing indifference to human
life which is becoming so acute
problem in the United States. a

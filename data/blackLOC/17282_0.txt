THE DETROIT NEWS
Anyone who assumes that our war aims are
clear and that they have widespread support may
be guilty of a very rash assumption if the national
state of mind squares with the views expressed in
the lead editorial of last Sunday's Detroit News.
The editorial states:
" The more we are obliged to look into the nature
of the Jap as revealed in this war, the more we
incline to wonder what is the highest common divi
sor of the races of mankind, to what degree we are
really brothers under the skin."
Outraged by Jap atrocities, the News writer
goes on to question the doctrine that claims all men
are pretty much alike when you peel away their
cultural differences. The writer adds that:" At
times, as when we attempt to fathom the psychology
of a race that blows up hospital ships and slaughters
the innocents by tens of thousands on suspicion of
.harboring a fugitive flier, it is like studying characters
from another world." We might add here
that the Germans and Italians have done some fancy
butchering of innocents also.
It is a great pity that the News writer permits
Jap atrocities to blind him to some very fundamental
truths. In the first place a good case can be made
for the savagery of Americans when you consider
the lynching of five thousand Negroes without the
stimulus of organized warfare and the popular indifference
of the majority of the people to inhuman
practices perpetrated against us every day. We
have not heard any stories yet of the Japanese collecting
fingers and toes of their victims for souvenirs
as has been true in this country. Thus on the point
of savagery, we suggest that if the Americans and
Japs were not brothers under skin, they are awfully
close cousins. the

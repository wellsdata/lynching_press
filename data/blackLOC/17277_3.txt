HEARTS MUST CHANGE
COURAGEOUS STATEMENTS
concerning our failings as a nation
will do much to help bring about
an America fit for all Americans.
White America is not so much wick
ed toward Negro America as it is
ignorant of Negro America. Ideas,
opinion, and
at the very foundation of this
American race problem. When,
therefore, we change these feel
ings, ideas, and attitudes into what
they sh ld be, the problem will
be solved. As in religion so in" ace
relations- there must be a heart
change, a conversion. You can't
change the heart of a people by
law. And as long as segregation and
lynch law are written in the
hearts of a people, this attitude will
make itself manifest in spite of law.
For men to act differently they
must see, think and feel differently.
Let those who have the foresight
to see, the wisdom to understand
and the courage to speak, against
monsters, prejudice, race- hate
the and lynch- law, continue to speak.

HARD ON RICHARDSON.
The Lynchers in Tennessee Will Be Run
to Cover and Prosecuted,
MEMPHIS, Sept. 5.- The five men ar
rested on suspicion of being concerned
in Friday night's lynching are out on
bail. They are W. S. Richardson, the
officer who had the six negroes in
charge; E. T. Atkinson, the driver of
of the wagon; J. W. Walker, W. S.
Thompson and J. D. Laxton. The last
three are farmers living near Kerrville,
where the negroes lynched are alleged
to have done the greater part of the
barn burning.
Judge Cooper, of the criminal court,
at first fixed the bail at$ 10,000 each,
but later reduced it$ 5,000 upon their
showing that they were poor men and
unable to furnish the large amount.
The grand jury is in session and has
summoned a large number of witnesses
in connection with the lynching.
When Richardson appeared on the
streets he was soon made to feel that it
would have been much pleasanter for
him to remain in jail. The most that
charity can say for him is that his con
duct was blameworthy foolhardiness,
and there is seemingly a larger as well
as an unkinder multitude who believe
that he knew an attempt would be made
to lynch his prisoners, and that he led
them into the hands of the mob by
bringing them over a previously declared
route.
The wife of one of the victims stated
that Atchison, the driver of the wagon,
told her the morning after the lynching
that Richardson held the ligt while his
prisoners were shot to death. But
Atchison denied that he had made such
a statement, and he insisted that Rich-
ardson held his hands above his head
while the shooting was in progress.
It was discovered, when the warrants
of arrest were examined, that they were
drawn up by Richardson, sworn to by
Laxton and signed by the magistrate
without question. Warrants are us
nally written out by magistrates them
selves.
A new set of officials were sworn in,
and the papers and people of Memphis
are demanding an enforcement of
law. the

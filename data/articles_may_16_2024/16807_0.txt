CINCINNATI IN MOB
The Cincinnati Gazette gives the following
account of the Riot that occurred
in that city last week. We are no advocate
of mob or Lynch law; but if its ex-
ercise is ever justifiable, it is when en-
forced against the corporations that have
for years been acting in violation and de.
fiance of express legal enactments. As a
natural consequence, they are at length
made to feel the dire effects of their
own example of disregard of law. The
occurrence at Cincinnatti will be a warn.
to other swindling shops, as well as
to ing those who confide too much in them.

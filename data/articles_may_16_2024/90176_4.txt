Favia has been really recalled, it is
likely he has done something to displease
his Government, and that he has
simply been relieved. This is indicated

the legation It is absurd said Mr.
.,
Bayard, to regard the recall of the Min-
, or suspension of diplomatic relations
ister, as an evidence of war.

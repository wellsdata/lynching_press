A MURDERER LYNCHED.
Free Fight Among Whites and
Blacks in Florida.
MICANOPY, Fla., Jan. 12.- Last night in
250 whites and blacks gathered in the pub-
lic square here to witness a tight_rope
performance. A negro rowdy, Henry
Hinson, used offensive language in the
presence of white ladies. W. Jefferson
Chitty, a prominent young white man, ordered
him away. Hinson went, but returned
with a pistol and shot and killed
Chitty. A free fight followed and twenty
pistol shots were exchanged. John Jones,
a negro friend of Hinson, was killed.
Hinson escaped, but a posse afterwards
captured him. He was jailed, but early
this morning& mob took him out and
hanged him. Both whites and negroes
justify the lynching. The excitement has
subsided though Hinson's body is still
swinging, from a tree in the public square.

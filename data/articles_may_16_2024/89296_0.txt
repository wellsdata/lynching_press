New Sharon Star: About a quarter
of a century ago New Sharon had an
experience. W. H. Middleham killed
his step- son, cut his throat in broad
daylight. There was talk of lynching,
but cooler heads counseled forbearance
, urged that it was a clear case
of murder and legal conviction could
not fail. He was hurried to jail. Rich
relatives put up the cash, a change
of venue was taken to Jasper county,
following indictment for murder in
the first degree, and the case was
fought through the for years,
from the lower to the courts higher courts

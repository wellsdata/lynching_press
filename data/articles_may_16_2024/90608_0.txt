mer: of courage,
The city of Chicago is the" garden spot" of America for
colored people. Great flocks of them are coming north in order
to get a breadth of freedom and liberty. It is well known
how the colored man is lynched, robbed and Jim Crowed in
the South. When he comes North he expects to find" the way,
the truth and the light" of a world worth living in. These people
look to the city officials, the guardians of the law and to their
own leaders and representatives for protection and information
concerning the methods of citizenship and right living.
Since Chicago has become good the great city of colored people

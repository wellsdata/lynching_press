Bloomington, Ind., Oct. 8.- Alfred
Stephens, proprietor of a street lunch
wagon, was shot and killed here by
Edward Jones, a negro. The negro
demanded a sandwich without paying
for it, and upon being refused shot
Stephens. After the shooting a large
crowd of excited people quickly gathered
and it was with much difficulty
that the negro was safely landed in
jail. No sooner had he been put behind
the bars, when another mob
formed around the jail with the intention
of taking the negro out and lynch-
ing him. The mob was stood off by a
show of force, and the negro was taken
quietly from the jail and
on the way to Indianapolis. started

Omaha is hanging its head in shame
because of the wild outbreak in which
a negro prisoner was lynched, Mayor
Ed Smith nearly murdered by the mob,
and the handsome new county building
set on fire. The local authorities
being helpless, federal troops were hurried
to the scene and quickly restored
order. Smith is in a way a" reform"
mayor, and decent Omaha people lay
the blame for the rioting to a bitter
newspaper campaign that has been
carried on against him and his police
force.
Still another race war broke out in
Elaine, Ark., in which five whites and
eleven negroes were killed. Troops
were sent there,. In Helena, near
by, the situation was too tense.

STRUNG UP.
A Negro Is Lynched at Asheville for Killing
a White Man.
A special to the State Chronicle from
Asheville says: Fred Tyler, white, an engineer
on the Western North Carolina
railroad, and Hezekiah Rankin, colored,
became involved in an altercation at the
round house here last night, during which
Tyler struck Rankin with a lump of coal.
Rankin ran off to secure a physician, and,
coming back, fired at Tyler, the bullet
striking him in the abdomen. A crowd
of railroad men caught Rankin, and, taking
him across the river, hung him to a
tree. His body was found morning.
Tyler will die. this

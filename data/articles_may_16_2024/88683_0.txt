Omaha, Neb., September 28.- A lynching, which developed
many characteristics of a race riot, held this city terrorized for
nine hours today.
Mayor Edward P. Smith was himself saved from lynching by
a policeman, who, it was reported, cut the rope from about the
mayor's neck while his comrades clubbed off the mob. At
midnight it was said that the mayor was unconscious in
hospital. a
The riot centered about the new
county courthouse building, which
was set on fire in the efforts to
reach William Brown, a
negro,
charged with attacking a white
girl a few days ago.
With e fianies
mounting
steadily from floor to floor, Sheriff
Mike Clark and
deputies
fought a grim battle of hours to
save Brown from those who clamored
for his life, but at 11 o'clock,
with the cries of the 100 or more
prisoners on the top floor- the jail
floor- ringing in his ears he was
compelled to surrender the negro,
who was hustled to an electrice
light pole and hanged.
GUN STORE LOOTED
The mob spirit began to manifest
itself during the afternoon,
but it was not until a gun store
had been looted that the sheriff
considered the situation serious.
He swore in extra deputies and
also brought in some police in uniform
, determined that the Taw
should take its course despite the
atrocity of the crime charged
against the negro.
By dark the streets in the vicinity
of the courthouse were blocked
for several squares. Chief of Police
Eberstein mounted a box and
attempted to address the crowd.
but was unable to make himself
heard, and only with difficulty
made his own escape. It was at
this time that the mob began
breaking windows in the courthouse
and shortly afterwards the
cry of" Fire" was heard,
Firemen were already on the
ground, but members of the mob,
upon whom they had turned
streams of water, had eut the
hose and it was useless. Other
fire companies brought more hose.
but it was similarly rendered useless
.
POLICE HELPLESS
Meanwhile the progress of the
flames could to extent be
an
judged by the smoke curling
from windows. Every available
policeman was on the scene by 7
o'clock, but they were impotent in
the bands of the thousands arrayed
against them, and troops at
Fort Omaha and Fort Crook were
appealed for. At 11 o'clock, however
, the lynching was over and
the crowd beginning to disperse
before the soldiers entrained for
the city. For hours it was not
known whether Sheriff Clarke and.
the prisoners were alive or dead.
' There was no way to get word in
or out of the building. Some
faces, supposed to be those of deputies
, could occasionally be discerned
through the obseuring
smoke at the windows and from
time to time the cries of the jail
prisoners, now imprisoned as well
by flame and smoke. could be
heard above the shouts and cries
of the mob.
Sheriff Clark is believed to have
surrendered Brown only when the
threat of death to his deputies became
too menacing. With the dispersal
of the mob after the lynching
firemen were able to get water
on the flames, which, it was reported
, were checked at the fourth
floor, one story below the jail.
The original members of the niob
were augmented by hundreds of others,
apparently equally determined to
lynch Brown They yelled for their
prisoners and attempted to get into
the courthouse. The few police officers
who had arrived were able to
keep them from breaking in the doors
for only a short while. A negro officer
was among those to report for
duty at the courthouse, but his presence
cnly angered the crowd. He was
the first victim of violence, being
badly beaten
The sheriff. then coupled up three
lines of interior fire hose and with
his deputies and some police officers
attemtped to disperse the crowd by
turning the water on them. Instead
of having a quieting effect it brought
a hail of stones and bricks. In 10
minutes 50 windows had been broken
on the south side of the courthouse and
much other damage done. From that
time on until the negro was strung up
to the pole the vicinity for
many
blocks around was a pedlam.
A small crowd of young men, none
of whom appeared over 20 years old,
then secured a rope, which they threw
over the ledge of a second- story window
. One of their number mounted
the rope to the window. From there
he pulled up a ladder that had been
provided and a score or more of his
companions followed. Once inside the
building, they were followed by many
more, who began working their way
shots were fired.
The sheriff's office is on the fourth.
floor, facing north on Farnam street.
and from the rear of his office is a
stairway and elevator to the jail
Nearly all of the men who got inside
were apparently armed, as numerous
shots were fire.
That occurred about 4 o'clock, after
the mob had been n the scene for
two hours. From that time on panie
reigned with the crowds on the streets.
Thousands of shots were fired. The
mob surged around the block on which
the courthouse stands. Finally, about
7 o'clock in the evening, after securing
fuel of kerosene and tar, they
started a fire the office of the
county treasurer in.

have no jurisdiction over the offense
of murder except under well de
fined conditions, he admonished the
jurors:
"If the grand jury in its inves-
tigation of any matter should dis-
cover there has been a violation
of law which does not fall within
the jurisdiction of the federal
court.....this grand jury and the
omicers of this court would be
well withing the bounds of pro-
priety to furnish state authorities
concerned with this information."

"Your function" the jurist
summed up. "is to ascertain
whether the criminal laws of the
United States have been violated.
The federal courts and the state
courts are moving toward
same great end-the sound. Arm
administration of the law under
which we live. State and federa
courts function within their pre-
scribed judsdictions. If there is no
jurisdiction, that is the end of my
inquiry."
The jury retired immediately af-
ter the charge to take dispose of
routine matters in order to go into
the lynching case Tuesday.

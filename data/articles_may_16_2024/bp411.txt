The Governor Acts Governor Acts
T
HE promptness with which Gov-
ernor Gordon H. Browning of
Tennessee acted to speed apprehen-
sion of members of the mob who
lynched Albert Gooden in Tipton
County on August 17, by setting
aside an award of $5,000 for this
purpose, coupled with his executive
indictment of their conduct, is in-
deed heartening to those who believe
in law and order.
No governor who takes seriously
his oath of office, and his moral re-
sponsibility to the citizens of his
state to preserve the majesty of the
law, could ignore such a challenge as
that the Tennessee mob hurled at
state and federal law enforcement
agencies when it cried aloud, "To hell
with the law."
Coming as it does after the gover-
nors of Florida and Mississippi fail-
ed objectively to bring the perpetra-
tors of recent lynchings in their
states to justice, Governor Brown-
ing's action is indicative of the kind
of leadership so sadly lacking in mob-
imbued states before public opinion
lost faith in 'states rights' in its ap-
plication to the lynching evil.
It is fair to assume that, had the
Tennessee governor's conception of
law and citizenship rights been the
code of the South ere this, effective
statutes to make lynching a major
crime might have been the rule rather
than the exception, and the univer-
sal demand for a federal law to curb
lynching might not have been so pro-
found.

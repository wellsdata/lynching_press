A Rapist Lynched.
William R. Long, charged with outraging
the three- year- old daughter of Edward Pritch
ard, at Kokomo, Indiana, was taken from jail
by a mob and lynched. Long had been arrested
for stealing a watch and horse, and the outraging
of the child occurring at about the same
time, he was examined by physicians, who declared
that he bore evidence of having committed
the fiendish crime. The mob took the
prisoner to the Main- street bridge, where
thousands had gathered. Rev. McCune was
present, and offered a prayer, and asked Long
if he was guilty of stealing the horse and the
watch. He replied that he was, but was not
guilty of raping the little child. He was placed
on a box and his hands and legs tied. The
mob then asked him if he had anything to say.
He commenced singing," See that my grave's
kept green." The prisoner gave his name as
Richard Long, and said he resided in Franklin.
The mob was well organized, and had their
coats turned inside out. The culprit's last
wish was," Hang me decent.". The lynching
was done in a quiet and determined manner
and the mob retired quietly.,

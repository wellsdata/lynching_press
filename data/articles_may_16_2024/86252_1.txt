Mob Batters Jall Door
To Lyncu nidnappers
A mob alleged to have been recruited
from San Jose speakeasies
aiter being held at bay for hours
by the sheriff of San Jose county
and his deputies, finally succeeded
in battering down the doors of the
jail which held Thomas Thurmond
and John Holmes, self confessed
slayers of Brooke Hart, and hung
them to trees in St. James Park last
Sunday night. Both men, were bad-
ly beaten before they were hanged.
Governor James Rolph, who refused
to send militia the
to protect
prisoners, on hearing of the lynch-
ing remarked" This is the best lesson
California has given the country
."
A throng of about 6000 persons,
composed of men, women and chil-

the lynching. Two shots fired
by men in the crowd was used as
a signal for the first attack on the
Jail. Immediately the officers inside
tossed tear gas bombs at the as-
sallants and they fell back blinded
and weeping. A hurried call for
more bombs was sent out, and the
nights in the building
ex-
tinguished, were
A second attack soon followed,
the mob using an 8- inch steel pipe
from the new post office building
for a battering ram. Officers releas-
ed more tear gas, momentarily halt-
ing the assault. A third advance,
covered by a barrage of water from
a fire hose, enabled the battering
squad to break in the door.
Sheriff Emig was knocked unconscious
and several of his deputies
received rough handling. The mob
first got hold of Antone Serpa, recently
convicted of manslaughter,
but one of the jail guards persuaded
them that they had the wrong man.
They pressed on until Thurmond
was found, and dragged him whimpering
and crying into the street. His
companion in crime, Holmes, strug-
gled with his captors to the end.
Thurmond WAS unaonaniona whan
he was hanged, but Holmes
hoisted into the air still kicking. was

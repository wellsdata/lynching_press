able Him- Both Men
Within Two Hours Dead.
That the negro was not lynched
when citizens of the town learned
Thompson was dead was due to
quick thinking on the part of Mayor
Beach, who mounted a box in front
of a grocery store and counseled an
angry crowd of men to refrain from
violence. They had been searching
for the negro, who ran from the scene
of the shooting, and fell in a patch
of weeds, and would have killed him
at once.
The negro first attempted to kill
Ralph Jones, foreman for the Bash&
Gray Construction Company, follow-
ing a quarrel over his pay. He left
his work on the sewer construction
superintended by Janes, announcing
he going to get a shotgun and
kill was the foreman.

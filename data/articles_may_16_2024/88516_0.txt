Maysville, Ky., Dec. 11.- Rumors that a
mob was coming to Cattletsburg to lynch
John Gibson, who is in jail here, charged
with torturing his stepdaughter to death,
led the authorities to drive him in a close
carriage to Germantown, twelve miles away,
late last night. A big crowd gathered at
Germantown upon the prisoner's arrival,
but no violence was offered. The prisoner
was on the verge of collapse from fright
over the report that he was to be burned
the stake. He was returned here this
at morning.

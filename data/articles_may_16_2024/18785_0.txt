.
MOB OF THIRTY MEN TAKE
PRISONERS FROM OFFICER
AND HANG THEM.
Mobile, Ala., March 11.- Dave
Poe, Tim Ransom and the two Jen
kinses, all negroes, were lynched at
Van Cleve, Miss., twenty miles north
of Biloxi, by a mob of thirty men
Monday night. The negroes were in
the custody of Deputy Sheriff Evans
of Jackson, en route to jail, when
the mob overtook them. A series of
incendiary fires of warehouses, causing
losses in feedstuffs and other
supplies, incensed the people of the
vicinity. The four negroes confessed
their guilt when the mob took them
from the sheriff, and all four were
hanged to limbs of trees by the side
of the road where their bodies were
found this, morning.

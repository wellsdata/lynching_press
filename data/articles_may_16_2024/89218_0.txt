These are days of great and multiplied
honors for Iowa; but of all the good
things recently said about the Hawkeye
State, nothing reflects higher credit upon
the commonwealth than the proud boast
in Gov. Shaw's biennial message that
there has not been a lynching in Iowa
during the past ten years. These years
have developed a carnival of lynchings
in other States, their atrocity ranging
from brutal to fiendish. The entire absence
of lynchings in this State during
the same period emphasizes with great
force the law- abiding character of our
people. Gov. Cummins in his inaugural
address dwelt with especial pride on this
Iowa trait. The good citizens of lowa
should guard with a noble zeal these laurels
of the State. They should resolve
that, no matter what provocation may
occur, they will extend this decade of
honor to a century. Justice is done in
the courts of Iowa, and it is rare, indeed,
that a guilty man escapes. An occasional
miscarriage of justice, however, is no
sufficient reason for mob violence. Lynch
law injures a State infinitely more than
an occasional failure to punish a
criminal. guilty

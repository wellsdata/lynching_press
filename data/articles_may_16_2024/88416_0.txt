The Fiend Was Lynched.
Chattanooga, Tenn., Oct. 5 .-- As predicted
, the lynching of Smith, the negro
convict who assaulted Maggie Hender-
son at Cole City, took place at 8 o'clock
last night. Two hundred and fifty armed
and disguised men went to the stockade
and demanded him. The guards refused
. The mob covered them with Win-
chesters. Resistance was useless and
they gave him up. The mob took him to
the place of his crime and shot him to
death with fifty- two bullets. The crowd
quickly dispersed. The girl, who is
highly connected is still unconscious.
There is no hope, for her recovery.

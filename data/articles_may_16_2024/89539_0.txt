A Murderer Lynched in Virginia.
LYNCHBURG, Va., May 18.- The excitement
eaused by the unprovoked murder of T. A. Jeter
by H. W. Terry, at Liberty, on Saturday, received
a fresh impulse at the funeral of Jeter,
at his home in another part of the county, and
at 2 o'clock this morning a party of twenty disguised
men gained possession of the jail by force
and hanged the murderer. Jeter was the most
popular man in the county, and his funeral yes-
lerday was very largely attended. Terry was a
son of W. R. Terry, a prominent man in the
State. The murderer is said to have been in-
Bane, but other cases recently tried in the State,
in which were cleared on claims of
insanity, murderers made the lynchers more determined.

"South Wind Blows" Blows" Wind South
THIS
HIS new novel about the
South by Clark Porteous re-
volves around the lynching of a
Negro by a white mob. Mr. Por-
teous approaches the lynching
tragedy from many points of
view, that of a reporter, a pho-
tographer, the minister, school
principal, the widow and father
of the victim, the wife of the
man killed by the victim and
several others. On the whole
this presentation of his story has
weakened rather than strength-
ened its effect. Since each ac-
count is very short and since
there is a certain amount of re-
petition the result is not as strik-
ing as it might have been had
the story been handled from only
a few point of view. The same
general method might have been
employed but the continuity
would have been greater.
Mr. Porteous does succeed in
laying bare the hypocrisy and
vicious cruelty of the white
South. Even those who would
have liked to have protested the
lynching or to have done what
was in their power to prevent it,
did not. Fear of being stamped
as a "nigger lover" stopped any
good impulses on the part of
those who liked Ab Lacey and
knew that the man he killed
was a drunken bully who had
provoked Lacey beyond the limit
of his endurance.
The scene of "South Wind
Blows" is Kilton, Miss., a town
which the publisher's blurb
states is much like Laurel, Miss.,
where the author attended
high school. Mr. Porteous is a
Southerner by birth and educa-
tion and is at present on the
staff of the Memphis Press-Scimi-
tar. He wrote the first 'draft of
his novel while at Harvard Uni-`
versity on a Nieman Fellowship
in 1946. His book is a sincere
condemnation of the South's
treatment of the Negro. The com-
munity which emerges through
the eyes of those who tell the
story is one where the dignity
of man has little meaning if that
man is black.
"South Wind Blows" is nei-
ther a pleasant nor a hopeful
book but it is an honest one
written by a Southerner about
the South..

"Son of the Moon"
"Son of the Moon" is the 1948
Harper Prize Novel. It is a well
written story of India and more
particularly of one Hindu family.
The author, Joseph George Hit-
rec, has brought to life a family
whose son, Vijay Ramsingh, re-
turns to his native land as the
book opens. He has spent two
years in England where he has.
gradually altered his outlook on
that country. His adjustment to
the more traditional life of his
family and caste is slow and he
at times rebels against them and
their customs. Before the close
of the book, however, he has
come to recognize the good in
both modes of life and to find
happiness in his family and
friends.
Although
his book begins
slowly, Mr. Hitrec is a writer
who combines good story-telling
and an understanding of charac-
ter. "Son of the Moon" is not
only an exciting romance it is
also an excellent account of the
customs and everyday life of
India. It is a colorful book but
it removes India from the realm
of the exotic to the more com-
prehensible level of day to day
living.

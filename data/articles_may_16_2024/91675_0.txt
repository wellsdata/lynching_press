OKLAHOMA MOB
Ada Jail Stormed and Prisoners
Accused of Murder

Slayer of Rich Cattleman and
Given Short
Accomplices Shrift
ADA, Okla., April 19.- At 3 o'clock
this morning a mob of 200 men stormed
the county jail here and after overpowering
the sheriff lynched four white
men. The men lynched were J. B. Miller
of Fort Worth, Tex., charged with
the murder of A. A. Bobbitt, a wealthy
cattleman of this section, and D. B. Bur-
rell, Jesse West and Joseph Allen, alleged
accomplices.
The mob worked rapidly and quietly,
nothing being known of the lynching
until daylight. The victims of the mob
were taken, to a barn within a short
distance of the jail.
" Bring a rope," the leader shouted,
and one by one the men were hanged.
The mob efected an entrance to the
jail by tearing down a high fence which
inclosed it. As soon as all the members
of the vigilance party were inside
the inclosure the leader pounded on the
jait door.
Four sturdy members of the mob fell
against the jail door, breaking it. Inside
one of the party dealt the sheriff
a blow with his revolver, felling him.
The mob then completed its work.
Walter Peeler, aged 17, a nephew of
Miller, confined in the jail for complicity
in the murder, was not molested
by the lynchers. He turned state's evidence
a week ago and was being heid
as a witness.
The electric wires were cut by the
mob prior to the hanging and the city
thrown into complete darkness.

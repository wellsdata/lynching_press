OF $5,000 SUITS
IN GREENBRIER
CO. TRAGEDY
CHARLESTON, W. Va., Mar. 10
president of
T. G. Nutter,
the !
Charleston, W. Va. branch of the Na-
tional Association for the Advance-
ment of Colored People, today stated
that sults to recover $5,000 from the
County Court of Greenbrier for the
lynching of two colored men in Dec.,
1931. was being vigorously pressed.
Mr. Nutter said:
"The suit was filed by the admin-
istrators of the estates of Jackson
and Banks (the two mob victims)
for $5.000 each in the circult court:
of Kanawha County, W. Va., against
the county court of Greenbrier Coun-
ty. It was brought under the Cape-
hart Anti-Lynching Law, which pro-:
vides that a county in which a lynch-:
ing occurs shall forfelt $5,000 and
the same may be recovered by the
administrator of the estate of the de-
ceased in any circuit court.
"The county court refused to pay
the amount provided by law, al-
though it did admit that the law
provided that payment should be
made in each case to the amount of
$5.000. They informed us when we
presented the bill that the Taxpayers
Association had requested them not
to pay it. The prosecuting attorney
of Greenbrier County instructed the
county court not to pay the bill on
the ground that the law was uncon-
stitutional.
"There are five attorneys working
on the case. D. L Saulsbury, J. M.
Ellis, Sam Lopinsky, Mr. Austin of
Greenbrier County and myself. I
think the cases will come up at the
next term of the circuit court, which
will be the second Monday in May.
We are still pushing the criminal
side of the matter and are hoping
to have the cases re-submitted at the
hext term of the Greenbrier criminal
court."
No use to rant over four per cent
beer. A keg wouldn't
make a runt
tipsy.

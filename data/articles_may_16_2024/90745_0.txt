Another Indiana Lynching.
,
A mob composed of many of the same
men who lynched Murderer Turrel at Bed-
ford, Ind., Monday morning, left Seymour
,
Tuesday night for Brownstown for a little
more work in the same line. They pursued
the same tactics of capturing an engine
and two cabcoses, on the O.& M. road, and
mustered about 100 men. They were after
Lou Trenck, who murdered Henry Faedler
one recent Sunday, and they got him. At
1:20 a. m., Tuesday, Treack was strung up.
and the mob quietly dispersed. The Sheriff
was not present at the jail to offer resistance,
and the guard had no keys; so the mob
stormed the jail
GEARY. LAW IS UPHELD.

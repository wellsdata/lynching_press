LYNCHING OF TWO
MEN MAY COST W.
VA. COUNTY $5,000
CHARLESTON, W. Va.-It may
cost Greenbrier County several thou-
sand dollars, for permitting a mob
to lynch two colored men several
months ago, since the state Supreme
Court last week decided that suit
may be brought in any state court
having jurisdiction over the subject
matter in the case.
The men lynched were taken from
the Greenbrier County jail where
they were being held charged with
the murder of a woman. The anti-
lynching statute of West Virginia
provides, however, that any county
in which a prisoner is lynched shall
pay to the relatives of the victim the
sum of five thousand dollars, recov-
erable by action in any court of the
state.
Suit was accordingly instituted in
the Kanawha county Court by Mrs.
Thelma Mullens, administratrix of
George Banks, one of the mob vic-
tims, against Greenbrier County.
The court ruled against the estate
on the grounds of lack of jurisdic-
tion, holding that action should be
brought in the county in which the
crime was perpetrated..
Upon appeal to the Supreme Court
the case was reversed and remanded,
sustaining the contention of counsel
that under the act, action may be
brought in any Court of jurisdiction
in the state. Judge Litz, handing
down the opinion, ruled that:
"As action against a county, un-
der Chapter 61, article 6, section 12,
Code, to recover the forfeiture of
any person charged with crime, who
has been taken from a state, county
or municipal officer in said county
and put to death, may be brought
in any state court having jurisdic-
tion of the subject matter."
Lawyer T. Gillis Nutter repre-
sented the plaintiff in the case and
added to the cause of justice for Ne-
gro citizenship rights in West Vir-
ginin another victory. Mr. Nutter
won the Negro's property rights in
the state in the Huntington case
when a colored citizen was prohi-
bited by the local courts from oc-
cupying property purchased by him
in a white locality, and also the
Charleston library case in which the
Negro's citizenship rights were es-
tablished in West Virginia for all
time.

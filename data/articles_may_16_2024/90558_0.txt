ABDUCTED SIX- YEAR- OLD CHILD.
When Antonio Scoladino Was Arrested
a Mob Wanted to Lynch Him.
Belleville, N. J., Jan. 14. Antonio
Scoladino was arrested here today for
attempting to abduct six- year- old Ser-
apina Curizzo, while her mother was
away from her home. Mrs. Curizzo
had been gone only a few minutes, but
when she returned she saw Scoladino
running off with the little one. The
child was recovered and the would- be
kidnaper was captured by Constable
Fisher in a barn. He pulled a revolver
but subsided when the chief of police
hit him on the head. When taken to
court Scoladino has followed by a mob
who talked of lynching. They were
kept back by the officers who fired
their revolvers into the air. The pris-
oner committed to the county jail
without was bail.

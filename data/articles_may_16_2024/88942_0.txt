Mood However Are in Ugly People,,

As Well as the Negroes and Drive

Deplore the Lynching.
Springfield, Mo., April 16. Quiet
prevailed here today, and indications
are that the race trouble is over. The
presence of troops has had the effect
of bringing the people to a full realization
of the situation. Six companies
patrol the streets.[ Details of the
now lynching are given on page 5.]
With the first appearance of the soldiers
last evening there came a revulsion
of sentiment. Before midnight, a
decided reaction had set in, and the
people began to condemn the action
of the mob that lynched the three ne-
groes and burned their bodies. Today
,
this feeling has gained strength, especially
when it became thoroughly appreciated
that Mabel Edmondson, a
white domestic, had declared positively
that Duncan and Copeland, the negroes
lynched, were not her assailants. This
feeling also was heightened by the arrival
from Jefferson City of the assistant
attorney general, sent by Gov-
ernor Folk to aid the county officials in
ferreting out and prosecuting the members
of the mob the names of many of
whom are known,.
Judge Lincoln, of the criminal court,
today ordered the special grand jury
convened Tuesday. The jury will be
instructed to make a thorough investigation
of the lynching and other acts
of the mob, and to indict all the leaders
apprehended. The better class of
citizens were strong today in their de-
mands that the rioters be punished to
the full extent of the law, and every
effort will be to secure their convictions

mark the condition of much of the
African native population, of whom
50,000,000 are under British rule.
Gardiner made a plea for United
Nations action in their behalf.
Richard H. S. Crossman, member
of the parliament and assistant ed-
itor of "The New Statesman and
Nation," speaking on British Colo-
nial Policy, urged upon the de-
mocracies the need of providing
mass literacy and economic de-
velopment for the "backward" peo-
ples, now confronted with the
promises of Communism.
Crossman warned that Commu-
nism offers to the dependent peo-
ples mass literacy, economic de-
velopment and the end of white
supremacy.
He held that the
Socialistic program of state own-
ership of basic industries, such as
had been applied in Britain and
will be put forth in the British
zone in Germany, would supply
the basis for democracy among
backward nations.

YORK — Atty. Gen.
would institute a strong anti-lynch institute a strong anti- lynch
program in accord with the Chi-
cago Defender's vigorous crusade
against the lynch evil.
In an address at the fifteenth an-
nual New York Herald Tribune
forum on Current Problems, Clark
said:
"Today and I reveal it for the
first time tonight-I have directed
that the entire matter be presented
to a Federal grand jury. I am
hopeful it will be able to put the
finger on those dastardly conspi-
rators who committed this brutal
act." Clark said that more than 2.-
500 persons had been questioned
in the case by Federal Bureau of
Investigation.
Democrats Plan Battle
Clark's announcement that the
lynchers would be prosecuted in
a federal court backed widespread
belief here that the Democratic
administration had fully prepared
and was ready to launch an all-out
fight against the American lynch
evil. Action on this No. 1 problem
has for years been sought by the
Chicag Defender which opened a
renewed campaign against this evil
earlier this year.
The disclosure of a scheduled
Federal grand jury trial followed
remarks by Oliver Harrington,
NAACP public relations officer,
who had charged on the forum
that when most Americans say
"justice" they "mean justice for
whites only."
"An agency committed to de-
fending the lives of its citizens
should spend less time finding le-
gal reasons for not acting on behalf
of human justice," he declared. “At
this point Clark revealed that he
had ordered Federal jury action
on the evidence gathered by FBI
agents in the Monroe lynching.
Arnall Praises Move
In the meantime, Gov. Ellis Ar-
nall, in Milwaukee to address a
forum when Clark's announcement
came through, said he was "de
lighted that positive action is about
to develop in the courts," adding
that "the people of Georgia are
most anxious that the lynchers be
apprehended and be given the full
penalty of the law-each member
of the mob deserves the electric
chair. As governor of the state I
express appreciation to Atty. Gen.
Tom Clark and the Federal au-
thorities."
Vincent Sheean, who won na-
tion-wide acclaim for his coverage
of the Lawrenceburg trials, said at
the Herald-Tribune forum that he
hoped that "cases of violence aris-
ing from interracial relationship
could henceforth be tried in an at-
mosphere of impartial law." He
appealed for Federal aid for Negro
education and for law enforcement
with a Federal anti-lynch law as
"things possible here and now."
Following Associate Supreme
Court Justice William O. Douglas,
who asserted that American ideals
can be the foundation of a great
commonwealth, Robert Kweku
Atta Gardiner, vice principal and
economics professor at Fourah Bay
college, West Africa, described the
low wages and exploitation which

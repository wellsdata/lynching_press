time afterward their feet were in the
water of the creek.
Jailer Waddell and Guard Hopps
were so much excited over their experience
that they could give little de-
scription of the mob, saying that they
were big men and all wore black
masks. They managed to get word to
the sheriff soon after the prisoners
were carried away, and when the
sheriff and posse found the bodies at
the bridge they were still warm, but
both were dead.
The best people of Glencoe and this
county are loud in their denunciation
of the lynching and propose to see
what can be done to discover who constitute
the mob.
Sheriff Rogers was killed by Mus-
grove and Cinqmars five miles south of
here, June 13. They were tramping
through this region. They quarreled
with a farmer and pounded him. A
warrant was issued for their arrest
and Sheriff Rogers went after them in
person. He found them just at dusk,
and ordered them to throw up their
hands.
Musgrove exclaimed," We don't have
to," and began firing on the sheriff.
Before the latter could draw his revolver
he had been shot five times.
The murderers were captured next
day in a swamp by a posse of 500 men.
An attempt was made at the time to
lynch them, but a company of the
state militia arrived at Glencoe from
St. Paul in the morning of June 15 and
prevented it. The prisoners were kept
in the St. Paul jail until the trial was
called the past week.
The men claimed to have come to
the northwest from Missouri and said
they were on their way to the
fields of North Dakota. harvest

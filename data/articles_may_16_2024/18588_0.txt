unholy a cause. Running saloons in
South Dakota is lawlessness, say the
best for it you may, and whether the
law be right or wrong, popular or unpopular
, it is not to the present credit or
future good of any community to mani-
fest openly such a brazen defiance of the
law the state. Such acts are closely
akin to mob violence, lynch law, looting
and similar acts destructive of
banks public and individual safety.

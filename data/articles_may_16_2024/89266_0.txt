Another misfortune is the fact that
we find in this country a disposition on
the part of the public press to magnify
the lynching of negroes in the south.
That such disgraceful disregard of law
is too common in the south is deplored
by every honorable man, but is it not
a reliable fact that for the same
causes the same effact would be found
in the north? We must admit that
the general crim" is the abuse of the
wives, sisters, or daughters of the
respectable white men y negroes, and
the fact that so large class in the
south are of the colored race who
violate both the law of God and man
which accounts largely for the number
of lynching in the sonth. We must
not forget that the wife, sister, daughter
or mother of the southern man is
as dear to them as they are to the
northera man, that the same noble
aspiration of the human heart for
kindred and friends is not confined
to sections or climate but, is universal;
,
and further, that degronation and disregard
of christain training is the misfortune
of circumstances, which accounts
largely for the preponderance
of the crimnal over the intellectual
in the negro in the south, which accounts
largely for the violation of law
in acts of awful the honor
import to
and safety to the female portion of
that section, and would be the same
the north under like circumstances. in

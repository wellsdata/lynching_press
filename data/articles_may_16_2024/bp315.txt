Governor Disputes Dictionary
On Definition Of Lynching
TALLAHASSEE, Fla.-(ANP)—
Gov. Millard Caldwell challenged
Webster's dictionary on the defini-
tion of "lynching" here last week
in denying that Jesse James
Fayne, a Negro farmhand, was
lynched last year.
Asked by R. B. Eleazer of the
Board
about
Methodist Church General
of Education, Nashville,
Payne's murder, Caldwell said.
"Whether or not the killing of
Jesse James Payne was a lynching
must depend upon one's definition
of that term. My personal opinion
is that the crime did not come
within any recognized definition of
lynching."
Eleazer explained to the gov-
ernor that he made the inquiry be-
cause he had been asked to pre-
pare a 1945 report for the Encyclo-
paedia year book. According to
Webster's New International dic-.
Etionary, the verb "lynch" means,
"to inflict punishment, especially
death, upon, without the forms of
law, as when a mob captures and
hangs a suspected person."
LYNCHED BY MOB
1
Payne was removed from his
jail cell by a mob and shot to death;
after being charged with raping a
five-year-old white girl. He was
not convicted of any crime.
Gov. Caldwell explained that he
did not take action to suspend
Sheriff Lonnie T. Davis, charged
with leaving the jail unguarded,
because "he was nevertheless the
choice of the people. Stupidity
and ineptitude are not sufficient
grounds for removal of an elected
official by the governor." he said.
Here is how Gov. Caldwell feels
about such cases:
"The ordeal of bringing a young
and innocent victim of rape into
open court and subjecting her to
detailed cross-examination by de-
ſense counsel could easily be as
great an injury as the original," he.
told Eleazer.
"This fact probably accounts for
a number of killings or lynchings
which might otherwise be avoid-
ed," the governor continued. "So-
ciety has not found a solution to
this problem.
"My comment on the case in
which you are interested is in line
with my policy of holding the citi-
zens of a county responsible for
the officials they elect to office.
"It is my inention to awaken a
sense of civic responsibility in our
citizens. To that end, I have re-
fused to do their work for them
on the theory that, when they have
found they must act or take the
consequences, they will act."
He claimed that he wants the
people "to awaken to a sense of
civil responsibility" in order to
stimulate them "to action and
make democracy work."

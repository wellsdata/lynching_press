MEET AT MEMPHIS
DOCTORS REFUSE TO
Memphis, Tenn.- The meeting
of the National Medical Association
, which was to have been
held in this city August 28 to 30,
has been changed and the session
will probably be held in
Philadelphia or Atlantic City on
the same dates. The immediate
reason for this change of place
of meeting is the savage and
barbarous acts perpetrated in
connection with the lynching
and burning of the Negro, Persons
, in the vicinity of Mem-
phis. To cap the climax of this
barbarity, the recent meeting of
the Tri- State Medical Association
was interrupted by members
of the mob of lynchers,
bringing the head of the burned
man and throwing it into the
midst of the delegates while in
session, The local committee
therefore requested that the
has meeting place be changed.

GEORGIA'S DISGRACE
That Georgia mob which lynched Leo Frank yesterday
disgraced not only the State of Georgia but the
United States. We are prone to boast of the superior-
ity of American civilization over that of warring Eur-
ope. The lynchers who took a man, for whose life the
sovereign people of Georgia were responsible, and killed
him did their worst to prove our boast unwarranted.
They advertised to the world that there is in the United
States the same barbaric sentiment that animates
sections of the world that are now at war.
It is refreshing to known that Gov. Slaton has
contended that the sentiment which would crucify
those who attempted to save the reputation of the State
of Georgia from the stain of causing the loss of the
life of a man on very weak circumstantial evidence
is not the real sentiment of the State, but that it was
prevalent only among a few of the misdirected of the
people. Let us hope that he is right, and let us hope
that Georgia will demonstrate that the lynching of
Frank has not the approval of the best people of the
State

Colored People today wired Postmas-i
ter General A. S. Burleson requesting
that he order an investigation into
the facts of the lynching of James
Spencer, a colored postal clerk at En-
terprise. Miss., on July 5, reminding
him of the fact that the federal gov-
ernment has the power of police pro-
tection over those in its service. AU
the same time the Association wired
Governor W. P. Hobby, of Texas, i
asking that he bring to justice the
members of the mob which on July 6,
at Paris, Texas, took from the county
Jail Irving and Herman Arthur who
were being held on a charge of having
killed their landlord and his son, and
burned them at the stake. The bar-
barity of this latter lynching is mag-
nified by dispatches in which the
sheriff at Paris, Texas, is quoted as
declaring that one of the two colored
men burned was not the right one
and that he doubted whether the
other was the right party, and in
which he is reported to have gone
into Arkansas on the trail of the men
believed to have killed the farmer
and his son,

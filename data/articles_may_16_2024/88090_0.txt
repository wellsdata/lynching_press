Omaha, Neb.- A lynching which developed
many characteristics of a race
riot held this city terrorized for nine
hours.
Mayor Smith is ill as a result of
abuse received at the hands of the
mob which lynched a negro and which
the mayor sought to dissuade from its
purpose.
The riot centered about the magnificent
new court house building, which
was set on fire in the efforts to reach
William Brown, a negro, charged with
criminally attacking Agnes Lobeck, a
white girl, a few days ago.
With the flames mounting steadily
from floor to floor, Sheriff Mike Clark
and his deputies fought a battle of
hours to save Brown, but with the cries
of 100 or more prisoners on the top
floor- the jail floor- ringing in his
ears, he was compelled to surrender
the prisoner.
The negro was hurried to an electric
light pole and hanged.
The negro was pulled out on the
south side of the court house, giving
the firemen an opportunity to work
on the north side, where the
fire
started,
The fire, however, had already destroyed
valuable records which can
never be replaced.
Firemen were already on the ground,
but members of the mob upon whom
they had turned streams of water had
cut the hose and it was useless. Other
fire companies brought more hose,
it was similarly rendered useless. but

Jail and Court House Partially

the recent inciting of racial hatred
by rabid elements are one of the
basic causes of the Walton County
massacre" and called for the death
penalty for "all the villains partici-
pating in the brutal murders."
Roger Malcolm, his wife, Mrs.
Dorothy Malcolin and Mrs. Mae
Dorsey and her husband, George

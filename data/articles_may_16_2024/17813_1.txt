Springfield Republican.
Well, anyhow, that innocent Missouri
negro who was hanged by a mob the
other day, because a white girl had
been found dead somewhere in his
vicinity," is said to have admitted just
before he was lynched that he had
served a term in the penitentiary for
criminal assault" upon some other wo
man. This important information
comes from the Pierce City correspondent
of the St. Louis Globe Democrat. So
what does it matter if he was innocent
of the particular crime for which he
was hanged? Mark Twain ought to
write a sequel to" Huckleberry Finn"
depict the Missouri attitude to
and ward the negro in a 50- year- after vein.

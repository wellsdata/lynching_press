Thwarted Legal Lynchings In Florida For 25 YearsMcGill
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., July 11.-When Florida opens its prison gates this month for the four defend-
ants in the "Little Scottsboro Case," that Southern state will pay unwilling tribute to a native son who has
been thwarting the legal lynching of Negroes here for more than a quarter century,

STORY OF SUCCESSFUL
DEFENSES
IS AMAZING
Although Attorney McGill's bril-
llant triumph in the "Little Scotts-
boro Case" was momentarily over-
shadowed by U. S. Supreme Court
Justice Black's unprecedented de-
nunciation of torture confessions,
the story of his many successful
jousts with Florida's State Attor-
neys is as mazing as th circum-
stances of the Pompano murder
case itself.
And his handling of this case
was typical of his practice of using
Florida's own laws to obtain justice
for Negroes.
A
The Jacksonville attorney, for
instance, only entered the "Little
Scottsboro Case" 48 hours before
the four terrorised youths were
scheduled to go to the electric
chair for the murder of Robert
Darcey, a white fish peddler.
Knowing that the boys had been
1orribly tortured in order to make
hem confess the crime, Attorney
McGill unearthed a 1,000-year-old
English common law which had
not been invoked in Florida for
salf a century-and halted the exe-
:ution.
This law, a Writ of Error, Coram
Vobis, (which means that a lower
court has passed on an Fissue of.
'act unadvisedly) has been invali-
lated in most states of the Union,
ut not in Florida, although not

The Florida Supreme Court hon-
red it, however, and 'seven long
years later, the Bupreme Court of

DEFENSE
SINGLETON JONES IN 2.
Less sensational but no. less ef-
fective was Mr. McGill's defenso
in 1922 of Thomas Singleton Jones,
an elderly Negro blacksmith, in
the alaying of Joe McGowan,
white prize fighter who threatened,
to kill the old man in a dispute
over a chisel.
Jones was indicted on the testi-
mony of two of the pugilist's white
companions. McGill began an im-
mediate investigation of the wit-
nesses' records, however, and both
of the white men fled the State.
The State's Attorney was forced to
drop the case in Duval Circuit
Court and Jones walked out a free!
At present, the lawyer, who has
had the same office and
samo
telephone
number in Jackson-
ville since 1908, is fighting a case
which may
rival
"Little
Boottsboro" one in national at-
tention.
This is the case of three Negro
youths under 15-Willie Clay, Ed-
ward Powell and Nathaniel Walk-
er-ho have been sentenced
feath in the alaying of Mary Louise
Curtis, a middle-aged white woman
n Jacksonville.
MAKES HIS USUAL
LAST MINUTE ENTRANCE
Making his usual last minute
antrance, Attorney McGill saved
the boys from the electric chair
ast Labor Day, after Governor
Fred R Cone had signed their
death warrants and left the State
to visit the New York World's
Fair.
In this writ, Attorney Magill
sharged that the boys' white lawyer
had improperty sworn out his or-
der for a writ of error and the
Florida Supreme Court reversed it-
self and halted the executions.

limuel Decatur McGill, successful; civil lawyer
whose altruism and brilliant, legal mind have led him
to defend successfully some of the most sensational
cases of "legal lynching" in Florida, is the dread
nemesis of the State's prosecuting attorneys. Through
his efforts, the defendants in the "Little Scottsboro
Case" will go free this month. Above is Magill in char-

case which attracted almost as
much attention as the Pompano

Abe Washington, a one-legged
Negro, was convicted in January,
1923 of the axe-slaying of a white
man and sentenced to be hanged.
A few months later, the Florida
legislature abolished hanging as a
means of execution and substituted
electrocution.
:
;
In June, a few hours before
Washington was scheduled to be
led to the electric chair, the sheriff
was served with a writ. Simuel D.
McGill had entered the case.
In an unprecedented action, the
Negro lawyer calmly charged that
hanging was illegal in Florida. On
the other hand, the writ held
Washington had been sentenced to
hang and therefore could not be
electrocuted: The legislature had
forgotten to provide for his case
in abolishing hanging, Magill ob-
served.
The State Attorney was furious,
but McGill carried the case to the
Florida Supreme Court. Losing
there, he.threatened to take it to
the U. 8. Supreme Court. The
State attempted to compromise.
MCGILL SCORNS
"COMPROMISE” OFFER
"Washington's got to die,", the
officials told McGill, "But we wil
let you choose how he dies. We
will either hang him or electrocute
him. You can name the means."
McGill scorned the 'compromise"
and began the long fight which
ended before the U. 8. Supreme
Court five years later. The highest
tribunal refused to hear the
because no Federal, question
involved, but when McGil asked
for time to search the Federal
pects of the case, Florida gave up
the fight.

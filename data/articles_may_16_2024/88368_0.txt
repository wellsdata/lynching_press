BELIEVED TO BE INNOCENT OF CRIME
GEORGIA MOB LYNCHES TWO NEGROES
Macon, Ga., July 6.- A posse of
nearly 100 farmers is searching for
John Richey and Thomas Brooks,
accused of killing Silas
negroes,
Turner, a white planter, at Gray,
Ga., Sunday night.
According to information received
here, two negroes, Will Green
and his son, were lynched during
an outbreak of race feeling after
the killing of Thomas.
The authorities believe the
Greens had no connection with the
murder
Will. Gordon, one of the three
negroes brought here for safekeeping
, is said to have accused Brooks
and Richey.
Green and his son were shot to
death.
Telephone wires leading to Gray
were cut and news of the lynchings
did not become known here
until yesterday, when sheriff's deputies
arrived with the three ne-
groes who are being held in connection
with the killing of Turner.
Turner went to the home of W.
H. King, a negro near Round Oak,
to collect bill and a dispute
arose, during a which he was shot.

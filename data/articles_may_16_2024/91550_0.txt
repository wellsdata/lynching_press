by Citizens. Hanged
SEATTLE, Wash., May 5.- Among the passengers from Latuya Bay to
Juneau on the Bertha, which arrived to- day, were a man named Nelson and
his wife, who reported to the authorities at Juneau a sensational case of
murder and lynching which occurred at Latuya Bay last November.
According to their story they and two others- white men- were at dinner
one day, when Steve Severts, one of the men, arose, walked out and returned
with a revolver, shot and killed the other white man and wounded
the woman, but before he could do further damage was disarmed by Nelson.
The latter and another white man, aided by an Indian, kept Severts a
prisoner for a month, meanwhile trying to communicate with the authorities
at Juneau. Finally, fearing Severts would escape or murder them all, he was
hanged by those at Latuya Bay. and wife then came to Juneau by
the first steamer and gave themselves Nelson up.

DANVILLE, KY., April 18.- A very dis-
astrous fire occurred ed her here Saturday
night. The jail and a number of adjoining
buildings were destroyed. The
sparks were blown three- quarters of a
mile and set fire to the Caldwell Institute
, which is a total loss. The building
cost$ 100,000; insurance only$ 25,000.
The fire is supposed to be the work of
incendiaries, who are supposed to be
the friends of a colored boy who was
taken out of jail by a mob and hanged
on Saturday morning raping a little
white girl seven years for old.

Waco, Tex .-" Curly" Hackney, thirty
, white, arrested for attacking an
eight- year- old girl, was taken from jail
here by a mob of 300 and hanged.
Hackney was crippled in the right
leg from a recent gunshot wound. He
was utterly imperturbed. His last
words were:" No use to argue with a
mob, Buddy; they hold aces and I
hold deuces. I'll say only one thing-
they're making it out worse than it
really was."
Hackney arrived at the scene of the
hanging in the first car, which was followed
by 50 others. Hackney coolly
leaned against the side of the car and
smoked a cigarette. A shout was put
up immediately for a rope.
A voice cried:" Hang him with
some skid chains!"
" Aw, get a rope," replied Hackney.
" Do it up right."
The sound was then heard of some
one tearing up a heavy cloth preparing
a crude rope. Hackney, hearing it,
said:
" Well, boys, there is one consolation
, anyway, I'll get to shake hands
with several of you in hell. I did it
and I guess I'll pay."
The rope was placed about his neck.
He was asked if he wished to make a
statement.
Objects to Shooting.
" I would like one thing fellows. If
there is a six- shooter in the crowd
please don't use it on my body. Here,
tie my hands behind me so that I won't
fight May God
the rope bless
. you
all."
He was then led limping along behind
several of the leaders to a tree.
While the rope was being drawn up,
Hackney said:
" Here, boys, let's do the thing right;
put the jolly old noose under my left
ear."
This was done, and one of the bystanders
remarked to him:
" You certainly are the gamest condemned
man I ever heard of."
" Sure I am," replied Hackney.
" There never was a gamer sucker than
I. I'm not afraid to die. I've faced it
before too many times."
He was then placed on a high
and with several men pulling on gate the

crowd turned to leave, some one fired
a shot at the body- hanging in the
moonlight and instantly a fusillade
fired. The body was riddled.

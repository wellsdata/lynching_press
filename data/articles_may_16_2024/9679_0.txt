The brutal beating of City Editor Cowen,
of The Leadville Herald, by Alderman Joy of
that city, has united the press in favor of
lynch law. The Tribune of Denver says the
fact that Joy is out on bail will facilitate the job
and save the trouble of breaking jail doors.
The Tribune continues:" Joy is an over- grown
loafer who has no business in decent company
at any time. It is the disgrace of a city like
Leadville that he should be a member of its
municipal body. A low, illiterate creature,
with nothing but brute strength and a bad
record to stand on, his elevation to a position
of responsibility is more of a reflection on the
city which chooses him than upon the scoundrel
himself. If the city editor of the Herald
dies the nasty cur ought to be hung. If he
the
lives dirty jail bird ought to be sent to
Canon City until he- loses some of his flesh."

Lacon Lynchers May Escape.
Peoria, Ill., Nov. 10.- The body of
George Stewart, the negro lynched near.
Lacon for an assault upon Mary
O'Brien of Toluca, was buried on a
farm near Lacon at the expense of the
county. Up to the present time the
authorities of Marshall county have
taken no steps to apprehend the lynchers
. Advices from Toluca are to the
effect that Miss O'Brien is rallying from
terrible experience and that she
is her likely to recover.

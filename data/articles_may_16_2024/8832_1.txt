WHAT WAS JOE.
interview In at Kansas an
Col. John C. days ago City a few
one of Orleans, New Wickliffe of,
lynched the eleven Italians, sta-
the leaders of the mob which
ted to a reporter that Joe
Macheca, who was considered
the chief of the offenders, probably
had not a drop of Italian
blood in his veins." His father,"
said Colonel Wickliffe," was an
Irishman, his mother an Ameri-
can- possibly of Italian descent.
When the father died his mother
married an Italian and Joe took
his stepfather's name, Macheca.

papers and registration
have been
certificates of eight
found. One of the others was
known to have frequently voted.

Hennessy. The Italian consul,
Nasquale Corte, says Monestario
was a fugitive from Italian justice
- an outlaw. That is Italy's
case against America." In addition
to this it is stated that Joe,
at the time of his sudden demise,
was consul for Bolivia at New
Orleans, The more Italy's case
is sifted, the worse it gets for
her. If Colonel Wickiffe is right,
Italy, instead of claiming indemnity
, ought to pay us a good
round sum for having punished
for her one of her escaped

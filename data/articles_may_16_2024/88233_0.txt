MOB BATTERS JAIL DOORS
Lynching of Six Negroes Who Shot
Wealthy Planter Appears
to Be Certainty.
Drew Miss., April 4 .-- With six ne
groes in jail, guarded by deputy sher
its, and an armed posse scouring the
hills near here for another party of
blacks, a mob is forming to batter
down the doors of the jail and lynch
the prisoners. The arrests followed
the shooting and wounding of C. E.
orman a wealthy planter. He was at
,
tacked by ten drunken a
negroes on
railroad track at midnight.
The black swarmed about him curs
,
ing, and Orman fired his revolver
twice. The blacks returned the fire
and wounded him six times. It is admitted
nothing can save the negroes
in jail if they proved to have been
with the party are.

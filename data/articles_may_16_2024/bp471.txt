Stop Lynching,
Chairman
Urges
of NAACP
To the Editor of the Tribunę; the Editor of the Tribunę;
The shocking lynching of Claude
Neal, and the even more distressing
act of the mob in advertising the
in
lynching many hours
supply final proof, if
advance,
such proof
were needed, that lynching can be
stopped only if federal aid is given
to the states as the Castigan-Wagner
Bi'l provides. This bill was not act-
ed upon in the last Senate despite
an overwhelming majority in both
houses of Congress which favored the
mease, because a small number of
senators who come from states with
the worst lynching records, blocked
action under the unanimous conseat
rule of the Senate.
.
The National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People for
25 years has worked incessantly to
arouse public opinion against lynch-
ing and to secure affective legisla-
tion backed by that public opinion.
The Association and other organiza-
tions, with a total membership of
40,000,00 Americans, of both races,
who labored to secure action during
the last session of Congress, were
sorely handicapped because of in-
sufficient funds for the printing of
enough literature, for telegrams, pos-
tage and travelling expenses of wit-
nesses at Washington and other nec-
essary costs.
Supported as it is, wholly by mem-
bhips and voluntary contributions,
the N.A.A.C.P. appeals to all Ameri-
cars who want to see our country's
rame cleared of the disgrace c.t
lynching, to help us by sending con-
tributions, of whatever amount, large
or small, the individual donor can
glve to help finance this important
campaign of public education.
Checks may be payable to Mary
White Ovington, Treasurer, at 69
Fifth Avenue, New York.

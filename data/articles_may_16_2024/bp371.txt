The lynching of a Negro soldier
In uniform, Pvt. Felix Hall of Ft.
Benning, Ga., "is the logical con-
sequence of your official endorse-
ment of the Jim Crow policy in
the Armed forces,' 'declared Dr.
James E. Jackson, vice-president
of the Southern Negro Youth Con-
letter

President

The letter called for the imme-
diate enactment of the Federal
Anti Lynching Bill, cash indemnity
to the lynched soldiers family and
the death penalty for the lynchers.
The president was also called upon
to banish Jim Crowism in the
Armed forces.
The full text of the letter fol-
lows;
Honorable Franklin D. Roosevelt
President of the United States
White House
Washington, D. C.
Dear Mr. President:
The conscience of the Nation
has been shocked by the lynch-
ing of a young Negro volunteer
on the Army reservation of Fort
Benning, Ga. After being missed
for several weeks the decomposed.
body of Private Felix Hall, 19 year
old Negro volunteer from Mill-
brook, Ala., was discovered swing-
ing from a tree with his arms
tied behinds him and his legs
bound together, The most recent
statement issued by Provost Mar-
shall Herbert B. Laux, in which he
states that "death might have re-
sulted from hanging or suicide"
indicates a bland attempt on the
part of Army authorities to close
the case by shifting the blame
for the crime onto the corpse of
the victim.
We demand a full investigation
of this crime with the immediate
i Court Martial of those officers
directly responsible for the pro-
tection and safety of the soldiers
of Fort Benning.
We demand the immediate ar-
rest of those responsible for the
death of Pvt. Hall and call for the
death penalty to be leveled against
the lynchers of this Negro volun-
teer. The family of young Felix
Hall, consisting of two brothers, a
grandmother and unemployed fa-
ther are in a destitute condition.
We demand that an indemnity of
$20,000 be paid to the family of
the deceased soldier.
We hold, Mr. President, that the
policy of Jim Crowism which with
your official endorsement prevails
in all branches of the armed
forces operates to invite violence
on the part of white soldiers and
the general populace against the
Negro soldier. The lynching of
this young Negro while in the uni-
form of the U.S. Army is but the
logical consequence of this un-de-
mocratic policy. We demand, there-
fore, that you Mr. President, issue
a decree to banish Jim Crowism
in all of its forms from all
branches of the Armed forces and
the National Defense industries.
This most recent lynching out-
rage demands that you immediate-
ly bring your powers of office to
bear to have Federal Anti
Lynching Law enacted.*

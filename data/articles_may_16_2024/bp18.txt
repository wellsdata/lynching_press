10 COLORED MEN
KILLED IN VICKS-

MEN KILLED.

ored man in the South, no matter how
respectable or innocent, a coroner's in-
quest was held with the following
jury: Harry Edwards, George Groome,
John Thompson, Harry Lee, Robert
Arnold and Harry Zizzi, all white. The
verdict of the coroner's jury was that
the deceased was killed by a shot from
a pistol in the hands of an unknown
person. Mr. Warren was married and
had a family and was a member of the
church.
Life Cheap in South.
The atrocious deed has aroused the
sympathy of the fair minded white
people, but that's all. This is the way
reputable, law-abiding colored men are
treated here in the South among their
best friends. Human life to white
men is as cheap as common clay, yet
Negroes are told to remain here and
work out their own salvation. Had this
officer killed another respectable
white man of good habits and law-
abiding, there would have been riot
protesting that the murdered man's
slayer be revenged. Now that race
men do not get justice either by judge
or jury and shot down like dogs, a de-
termined effort will be made here-
after that when one of their race goes,
they will take a slayer with him. Too
long and too often are colored men
shot down and the white man to live.
News Suppressed.
This story was not given to the As.
sociated Press but had a mob lynched
him, it would have been heralded
over the world. This only goes to
prove, as the Defender says, that many
of the race in the South are killed and
a report of it is never seen in news
columns.

Vicksburg, Miss., Nov. 21.-Burke
Warren, a respectable race man, who
worked for the Y. hnd M. B. shops,
was shot down like a dog on Walnut
street by several police officers. The
Chief of Police Groome added to the
mystery of the killing by his indiffer-
ence. Anxious to take a human life
a colored man passing Walnut and
South streets at 10:30 o'clock at night.
The officers yelled for him to halt, the
man kept walking. A shot was fired
from the dark by this officer of the
law and supposed guardian of the
peace. The man was as innocent as a
new born babe. The shot pierced his
heart and he lay prostrate and died a
moment later. Chief Groome exhibit-
ed his gameness by going to the dead
man, kicking his body, it is said, by
onlookers, to see if he was dead, then
called an undertaker who arrived a
half hour after the bleeding body lay
in the streets looked upon by a mor-
bid crowd.

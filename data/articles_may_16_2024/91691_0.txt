DOWN ON LYNCHING.
Governor Hogg Wants to Put a stop to
Such Proceedings.
AUSTIN, Tex., Feb. 7.- In view of the
torture of the negro Smith at Paris a
few days ago, Governor Hogg today sent
a message to the legislature suggesting
a law to put a stop to such work in the
future. He suggests that where persons
are taken by a mob and lynched, the
county in which it occurs shall be liable
for heavy damages to the heirs of the
lynched person; also holding the county
responsible for damages in case of
lynching before the lynched party is
arrested, unless the lynchers are indict-
Ad within gnonified timen landing of
persons and corporations
abetting lynchings responsible for dam
ages.-

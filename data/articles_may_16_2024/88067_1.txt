The situation in Cairo at 2:45 a. m.
is very quiet in the downtown section
and no evidence that a mob has run
riot can be seen. The mob has dispersed
to a great extent but the
search for Alexander still goes on in
the upper party of the city, or negro
section, and his capture would be the
for an immediate mob alarm
cause and he would be lynched at once.
" When I first heard of the lynching
and rioting," said the governor," I
immediately called Cairo on the long
distance and could not get the sheriff.
I talked to a police sergeant, who told
me that everything was quiet
that the mob had dispersed. and

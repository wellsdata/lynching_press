NEWPORT LYNCHING.
Some few papers in this state,
and several in the state of Ar-
, are rearing up on their
hind kansas legs and, pawing the air
about the recent lynching at
Newport. We are not in sympathy
of lynch law law and and, ordinarily,
never will be, but we have nothing
but the highest regard for
the brave fathers, brothers and
husbands who, through the heat
of excitement incident to the terrible
crime which was committed
by the brute who was lynched
, went forth and revenged one
of the most brutal and dastardly
in the history of the state
of crimes Arkansas.

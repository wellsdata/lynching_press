THE lynching of the negro boy at
Tullahoma last Monday night was a
foul crime and the work of cowardly
assassins. The authorities should
leave no stone unturned to bring the
perpetrators to justice. No community
is safe where such outrages go unpunished
. The sooner the lawless
wretches who committed this deed
are sent to the mines at Briceville or
elsewhere, in stripes, the better it
will be for the peace and prosperity
not only of Tullahoma, but of
State at large. the

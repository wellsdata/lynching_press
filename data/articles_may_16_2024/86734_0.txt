INDIAN LYNCHED AT THE DALLES.- On Monday
evening, 1st March, an Indian named Giddon was
hung by the people of Dalles, for the violation of a
white woman named Pete, at that place two nights
before. He had been tried before a justice of the
peace and bound over. The Indian denied the
crime, but admitted he had been in Mr. Pete's house
at the time specified. The woman herself, and a
boy who was in the house at the time, proved the
commission of the offence. The crowd thought the
case sufficiently made out to dispense with further
ceremony, and hurrying the prisoner out of
town, summarily strung him up to a tree. the

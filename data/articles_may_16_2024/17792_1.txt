WORK OF LA MAFIA
BY ASSOCIATED PRESS.
New Orleans, Nov. 30.- Guisseppe Im
pozzato, a prominent Italian maccoroni
manufacturer, was killed yesterday. The
circumstances point to the work of the La
Mafia, as he was lured to a lonely neighborhood
on a friendly mission. During
the excitement over the assassination of
Chief of Police Hennessey he was held as
suspect, but was released before the trial
and a lynching.

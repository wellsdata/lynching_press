The White Man's Burden Burden Man's White

HE LATE MR. DOOLEY used to say that the trouble with the
Negro is that he is too easily lyrched. To paraphrase Mr. Doug-
lass' expression: "The race that is lynched easiest is lynched
u.terest" The Negro, being the most frequent victim of mob violence,
makes the greatest outcry against the barbarity and iniquity of it. The
man who feels the wound will utter the groan.
But on thoughtful analysis it readily appears that the white man is on thoughtful analysis it readily appears that the white man is
is the greater sufferer from the
mob malady, albeit the Negro bears
the heaviest brunt of affliction.
The reactionary effect of the rabies
of race hatred which prompts
nching is well described by the
post Goldsmith in his well known
nes on "A Mad Dog":

in charge of the machinery of gov-
ernment and is responsible to the
judgment and conscience of the
world for the maintenance of law
and order.
America is the most murderous
and bloodthirsty nation on the
face of the earth which lays claim
to civilization. Its reputation is
inished and its fair name stig-
imatized by the prevalence of these
barbarous and inhuman practices.
America at one time sought to pose
as the moral monitor over the con-
science and character of the con-
duct of cther nations, but her
hands, reddened by the blood of
thousands of helpless victims, who
have perished without the law.
estop her from such high presump-
tion.
Germany, which we would like to
law by reason of her barbarity
against the Jews. hurls back the
saist confounding rejoinder:
"There is no such thing as the
nching. mutilation and burning
of human beings in Germany such
as abound in your country." White
America can only hang her dis-
graced head in shame.
There have been fifteen hundred
white victims of the mob during
the past fifty years. White men-
even white
women-have been
burned at stake.
The recent
lynching and burning of two white
then at San Jose, California, was as
atrocious and horrible as any oc-
rurrence in the whole red record of
inching. If not a single Negro
had been lynched during the past
half century the white victims
alone would be sufficient to make
imperative drastic
provision. it is sometimes boasted
that this is a white man's civiliza-

barbarities.

Hitherto efforts to this effect
have been inspired mainly by the
Neroes and well-meaning whites
as if they are acting altruistically
in behalf of the suffering race. The
Dyer Anu-Lynching Bill was spon-
sored chiefly by Negroes and was
defended and defeated chiefly be-
cause it was looked upon as i Negro
ineasure. On the other hand, it
should be the highest concern of
American statesmanship to blot out
this stigma from the nation's
escutcheon and vindicate its fair
name in the eyes of the worid.
Material recovery upon which the
energies of the nation are now
focuLaing is certainly not of
Areater importance or consequence
than moral recovery, without which
material prosperity can be of no en-
during value. It is as reprehensible
to condone rape or kidnaping in or-
der in condemn lynciling sa it in te

MURDER. FOR LYNCHED
Mob Hangs a Colored Youth For Killing a
White Boy.
SALLISBURY, Md.( Special).- Garfield
King, colored, aged about eighteen years,
was taken from the jail at this place,
hanged to a tree and shot.
He was awalting trial on the charge of
having deliberately shot Herman Kenny, a
white boy about the same age as himself.
A number of men from the neighborhood
in which Kenny's parents live rode into
town and broke down the jail doors, forced
open the cell in which King was confined,
and dragged him out, the colorod man all
the while fighting desperately and pleading
for merey. A light clothesline was tied
about his neck, thrown over a limb and the
unfortunate boy was strung up. The rope
broke and he fell, seemingly unconscious.
After lying in this condition for a few
minutes he regained his feet and made an
effort to escape. His captors shot him
through the body and beat and kicked him
without mercy, then placed the rope around
his neck and strung him up a second time.
As he dangled in the air at least fifty pistol
bullets were fired into his body, which was
left hanging while the lynchers dispersed.

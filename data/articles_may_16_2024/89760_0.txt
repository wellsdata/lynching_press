NEGRO DESPERADO LYNCHED.
Shot a Man on the Street and Assaulted
a Macon Girl.
MACON, Ga., Sept. 12.- A murder was
committed in this city this morning, and
this afternoon the slayer was lynched, not
for murder, however, but for the crime of
rape. This morning about 8 o'clock Charley
Gibson and Jim Smith, both colored, engaged
in a quarrel about the latter accusing
the former with stealing 30 cents. Smith,
not inclined to fight, turned to go away,
whereupon Gibson drew a pistol and shot
him in the back and head, killing him instantly
. Gibson then fled. The sheriff and
posse were soon in pursuit and kept up the
chase until 4 p. m., ocasionally exchanging
shots with the fugitive. At 5 p. m. the murderer
was run to cover and surrounded by
the deputies. The negro being well armed,
gave shot for shot until brought down by
three bullets from Winchester rifles.
The negro had been suspected of having
outraged a Miss Chapman a few nights ago,
and this suspicion was confirmed by his confession
. A large crowd soon gathered at
the scene of the shooting, but there were no
threats of violence or intimidation. The
sheriff and deputies returned to the city to
get a vehicle to convey the wounded man
to the city, and while they were absent the
negro again confessed to having raped Miss
Chapman and committing thefts and
burglaries. The crowd at once secured a
rope and swung the negro from a limb. Gib-
son was an ex- convict, having served several
years in the chain gang. In his house
were found innumerable articles stolen from
residences in this city, many of which have
been identified by owners. In the room were
shoes and stolen from the house
where he had clothes outraged Miss Chapman.

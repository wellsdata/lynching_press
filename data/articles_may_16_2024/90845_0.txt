LYNCH A WOMAN.
Mrs. W. E. Holton the Victim of a Barbarous
Crime in Nebraska.
Some time Friday Mrs. W. E. Holton.
a respectable woman living alone on a
ranch in an isolated part of Keyapaha
County, Nebraska, was lynched. The
crime is credited to the vigilantes of the
district, who believed her in league with
cattle rustlers. Some think the rustlers
committed the crime in revenge for evidence
against them furnished by the
woman, The coroner found$ 60 on the
woman's person, which is regarded as
certain evidence the crime was not committed
by tramps, as was at first supposed
. Her struggle for life had been a
hard one. The bedding and clothing of
the woman were torn and scattered about
the building. Her shoes had evidently
been removed, probably by herself, preparatory
to going to bed, when surprised
by the lynchers. The woman had evidently
been assaulted before she was
hanged, and everything points to a preplan
for the perpetration of the
meditated dastardly deed.

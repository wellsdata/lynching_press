FROM THE RIO GRANDE.- Murder
and Lynch Law .-- By the arrival
of the steamship Yacht we have
received the American Flag of the
17th inst. There were reports of
Indian depredations between Browns-
ville and Point Isabel. The house
of Mr. G. L. Stillwater, near the Sal
Colerado, was attacked by eleven
Indians, who, however, were repulsed
. It is supposed that a Mr. Hol-
brook was killed by them. The Flag
relates that a young Mexican who
shot and killed another Mexican, at
Monte Bank, and attempted to escape
by swimming the river, was
captured, brought back, and hung
twenty minutes from the time
the murder was committed. Another
occurrence of the same kind took
place on the 11th inst. The night
before, at a fandango, or rather after
having left it, Capt. John Brannen
was followed, stabbed, and killed by
a notorious ruffian, named Bill Har-
dv. He was arrested next morning
about daylight, ironed and taken to
jail. The only cause assigned for
the brutal outrage was the refusal
of Brennan to let Hardy have money
while at Brazos. On learning
the character of the man, and the
insecureness of the jail, the citizens
of Brownsville determined, as the
prisoner had confessed his guilt, to
cut short his murderous career at
once. A meeting assembled, and it
was voted that the culprit should be
hung forthwith. The Flag describes
the rest of the proceedings as follows:
" The crowd then proceeded to the
jail and demanded the culprit. The
prisoner was unfettered and brought
forth, and in that condition permit-
led to walk to the place of his execution
. He evinced the most perfect
indifference as to his fate, not suffering
a muscle of his face or limb to
betray the least emotion, and even
took the rope that was to hang him
and tied the hangman's knot to show
how it was done, without the
est perceptible tremor of the nerve slight-.

Two Negroes Hanged by Mob.
Memphis, October 12.- A special from
Lula, Miss., says: Jim and Frank Davis,
negroes, charged with having shot and
probably fatally wounded John C. Ken-
dall, a conductor of the Illinois Central
railroad, were taken from jail here last
night by a mob and hanged. The shooting
of Kendall occurred aboard a passenger
train near here late today when the
conductor endeavored to quiet the negroes,
who, it is said, had been drinking and
creating a disturbance. Another negro
who participated the shooting escaped
but is being pursued in by a posse.

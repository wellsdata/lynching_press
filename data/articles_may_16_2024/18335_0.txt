The original trouble arose over an at
tempted assault upon a white woman by a
negro, who escaped capture by rapid flight,

stones and driven away.
Both whites and blacks then armed them
selves and threats were freely made. Thers
was no clash until last Saturday, when Marshal
Lockhart attempted to disarm" Cap
tain" Greathouse, who is a leader of his
people. Greathouse resisted and shot the
marshal. He avoided lynching by flight,
but on Saturday night surrendered and was
placed in at The of
the negro from Grandview will
probably allay population the excitement.

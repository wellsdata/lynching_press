down here.
We don't approve of lynching
anywhere. But there's one main
difference between the lynching of
negroes in that section of the north
and the lynching of them here.
Criminals, the unmistakably guilty,
are often lynched here; and then generally
for one particular, heinous
HUNcrime. There, any excuse that offers
seems to the
the lynchers; and, having gone after
the guilty negro, the communities
, there seems to become blinded with
- a species of race hatred hard to understand
, and go in for the indiscriminate
slaughter of every negro
. who is so unfortunate as to cross the
path of the mob. Here lynchings
,
partake of the nature of executions;
. they are punishments for the guilty.
There, they seem to spring from a
kind of blind, unreasoning mania
against a race of docile people. There
is a vast difference.
We can only hope that the men of
those sections will learn more about
the negroes- and that the bitter
blood- lust which galls their
will pass away. hearts

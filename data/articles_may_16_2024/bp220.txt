resolution, prepared
in the form of an amendment, was
submitted to the subcommission
which was drafting a bill of hu-
man rights to be acted upon by the
full commission.
Walter White. despite plans to
the contrary, did not attend the
Geneva meeting due to the press
of the NAACP affairs, it was re-

It was also learned. however.
that Edward Lawson, Social Af-
fairs officer of the Human Rights
Division of the UN is now present
at the meeting. Mr. Lawson is the
only Negro there officially.
As a member of the Secretariat.
Mr. Lawson is assisting in the

tional conference. Thirty-four
years old. Mr. Lawson is a long-
time U. S.-government employee
and prior to joining the UN in
1916. served as New York regional
director for the FEPC. His work at
the UN has been devoted to the
human rights phase of that body's
total activity.
Ore reason Mr. White's office ad-
vaneed for his sudden decision not
to go to Geneva, was that the sub-
commission will work out the final
draft of an International Bill of
Rights on which they are now
working, in New York later this
year.
Presents Proposals
Reports reaching New York
from Geneva revealed meanwhile

while the other three were pro-
cedural.
Mr. Daniels also included this
comment: "There is a time of hope
in the United States following the
report of the President's Commit-
tee on Civil Rights. But I think
we ought to recognize that in the
world there is a good deal of
skepticism about this subcommis-
sion's ability to do anything about
these problems."

Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt pro-
posed this week before the United
Nations Subcommittee on Human
Rights a world bill of rights en-

the United States is the most
horrible crime of civiliza-
tion," Russia told the United
Nations Subcommission on Human
Rights last Friday.
A. P. Borisov, the Russian dele-
gate, charged that 40 lynchings

Daniels Is Present
The United States delegate. Jon-
athan Daniels, of Raleigh, N. C.,

The full Commission on Human
Rights, under the chairmanship of
Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt. opened a
three-week conference last Mon-
day to draw up an international
bill of human rights. Eighteen
countries are represented at the
conference.
Borisov said Daniels "only

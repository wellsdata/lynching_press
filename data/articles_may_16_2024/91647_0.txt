Assailant Lad's the Save Police
From Telegraph Pole
SEATTLE, March 27.- The timely arrival
of the police saved Basqualla
Mariella, a laborer, from being lynched
by a mob of 200 angry residents of
the Beacon hill district this alternoon
after the man had shot and dangerously
wounded Early Young, a 19 year
old boy, who had been playing ball
the alley back of his home. in
The trouble started when Mariella,
who, it is said, had been drinking, attacked
the boys, attempting to take
the ball away from Young. A fight
ensued, during which the man drew a
revolver and shot the boy in the side,
the ball piercing his left lung.
Pass-
ersby rushed to the boy's aid and Ma-
riella started to run down the hill,
closely followed by a crowd of men and
boys, which grew in numbers as
chase proceeded. the
Mariella fired several shots at his
pursuers, but none of them took effect,
and he was finally cornered in the hall
of a tenement, in which he sought
shelter. Several men jumped upon
him
and gave him a severe beating.
Dragging
him out of the building they began
to call for a rope and threatened to
hang the man when a squad of police-
arrived in an automobile and res-
men cued the prisoner.
Young was hurried to the city emergency
hospital, his injuries are
said to be serious where.

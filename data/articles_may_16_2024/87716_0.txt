NEGRO LYNCHED.
+
Bidney Randolph Taken from a Mary-
Jand Jail and Hanged.
Sydney Randolph( colored) who was
confined in the Montgomery County Jail
at Rockville, Md., for a brutal assault
upon the Buxton family of Gaithersburg,
Md., at their home, May 25 last, as a result
of which Sadie Buxtn, a 9- year- old
daughter, died, was taken from the jail by
a mob of twenty or thirty people and
hanged. The mob experienced but little
difficulty in entering the jail, but the appearance
of the cell occupied by Randolph
suggests that a terrific struggle had taken
place between the prisoner, who was a
powerful; six- footer, and the band of
avengers. Randolph protested his innocence
and begged for his life, but his
pleas were unavailing. The mob was
apparently well organized and
evi-
dently knew their business, as the knot
was tied in hangman's style and the entire
affair was conducted quietly and quickly.
The motive for Randolph's assault on
Buxtons has never been learned. the

LOUISVILLE, Miss. (ANP}—|
With the indictment of 17 white
men for the lynching of a 85-year-
old colored man last April, a mild
sensation was created
last week.
The case is attracting statewide in-
terest because all of
whites are prominent
known throughout the state.
Reuben Micou was their victim. It
is alleged that Micou had a fight
with Lee McDowell of Choctaw
County on April 1. The next day he
was taken from his home by the
mob. His whipped and bullet-ridden
body was found several miles away.
The Winston County grand jury
is conducting the investigation
which started Monday, July 10. Ac-
cording to county officers, five of
the men have confessed to their
part in the lynching. Fifteen of the
indicted men are of Choctaw Coun-

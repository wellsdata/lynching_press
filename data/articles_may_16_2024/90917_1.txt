The Grand Jury of St. Clair county,
III., have indicted fourteen of the
leading citizens of Belleville for as-
sisting to lynch David Wyatt, the colored
school teacher last June, and
when they have their trial the first
of January it looks as though some
of the good. Christians in that locality
will have a chance to break into jail
or into the Pen at Joliet.,

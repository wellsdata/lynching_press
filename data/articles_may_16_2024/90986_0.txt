The Rev. J. E. Ford, pastor of Zion
Baptist Church of Denver, and C. W.
Buford had a conference with Governor
Orman recently in regard to matters
concerning the negro population of the
state. One subject they brought up
was as to the means that should be
adopted to bring to justice the members
of the mob that lynched Washing-
ton Wallace. They thought the governor
should do something but his excellency
said the matter was in the province
of the grand jury of Huerfano
county. Another matter that was
brought up was the enactment of an
anti- lynching law in the state. Mr.
Buford and the Rev. Mr. Ford told the
governor that such a law was necessary
in the state as lynching was becoming
so prevalent that the negroes,
they said, would support any party
Gov-
that declared against lynching.
ernor Orman did not express himself
definitely, but he said he would do
what he could further anti- lync ... ng
legislation. to

IN WYOMING
NEGRO LYNCHED
Laramie, Wyo., Aug. 30.- Joe
Martin, colored, was lynched by
a mob of 300 men in front of
Judge Carpenter's house last
night. Martin was a trusty in the
county jail. He attacked a white
girl, Della Rouse, in the jail
kitchen, and slashed her face
and arms with a knife. One man
was injured when entering the
jail to drag out the prisoner.
After assaulting Miss Krause
with a razor Martin was placed
in a cell in the county jail. Last
night a mob of several hundred
men formed outside the jail. The
first intimation that Sheriff Cook
had of the contemplated lynching
was when two masked men appeared
in the kitchen of the jail
house and with guns leveled at
him, told him that there were 200
men waiting outside for the negro
and that he would better not
attempt to make any trouble for
them. In the meantime another
masked man took the keys of the
jail from the Sheriff's pockets and
then the three started for the ne-
gro's cell. On the way they met
Dr. Miller, who had been summoned
dress two wounds on
Martin, to self- inflicted with the
same razor with which he had assaulted
the girl and Turnkey
Jones. The doctor and the turnkey
were compelled to stand
against the cage of the cells with
their faces turned away from the
mob. The negro was then taken
from his cell and hurriedly marched
through the court house into
the street. Arriving at a lamp
post a short distance from the jail
the negro was quickly strung up
the post. During the entire proceeding
the negro did not speak
or attempt to resist the mob.
Within an hour after the lynching
the streets were deserted.
Acting Coroner Grant turned
the body of the negro over to an
undertaker.
Miss Krause would have been
killed by Martin had not the wife
of Sheriff Coo held Martin until
his rage had cooled and until he
could be taken from the kitchen
.
On the way out he slashed
Frank Fraser, a bystander, with a
butcher knife, which he had grab
bed from a table. Fraser's wound
is not serious. Miss Krause, who
from Chillicothe, Mo., is not
seriously comes hurt.

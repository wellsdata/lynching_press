Champ Clark and his son joined a posse the
other day which subdued a mob of lynchers and
saved their would- be victim.
The governor of Mis-
souri recently declared officially that Champ Clark
was the first citizen of that state, and the Hart-
ford Courant, in commenting on Clark's work in
stopping the lynching proceedings, says it is inclined
to agree with the governor, but adds:" Champ
Clark is not perfect, as a matter of course. For one
that, he is. a democrat; and for another thing, he
is a free- trade democrat. But his envinronment accounts
for these defects and in
way excuses
them." a

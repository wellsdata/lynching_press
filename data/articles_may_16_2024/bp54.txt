BUSINESS LEADERS
RESENT LYNCHING
Mob Victim Was A
"Good" Citizen
PELEHATCHOE, Miss.-Believe, Miss.- Believe
or not Mississippi has has a con-
science, for a group of her citizens
here became highly indignant over
the lynching of Henry
seventy-year-old
Bedford,
man, who
was
brutally whipped to death by a mob
of white men on July 30. Public
feeling reached such a high pitch
that Sheriff Therill was compelled
to arrest four of the lynchers.
There is fear less the four men
held for the lynching be harmed
themselves. By a curious irony of
fate the very group of white men
or the business men and planta-
tion owners who are responsible for
the lynch terror are the most indig-
nant over the lynching of the Ne-
gro.
Henry Allen, the mob victim won
the respect of all the white during
slavery by being a quiet docile
slave without any semblance of re-
volutionary spirit. One press re-
lease says "he continued to be the
ideal slave and had won the 're-
spect' and 'admiration' of the lynch
rulers."
Because this man had always
remained in this place" the white
business men of the city and those
in nearby communities objected to
the mob's action and there is still
some fear that those who are re-
sponsible for his death may them-
selves get a dose of their own medi-
cine.
Reemployment Drive
On In Washington
WASHINGTON, D. C., ANP)
-A city-wide reemployment cam-
paign was initiated here with the
hope of taking as many persons
as possible off local relief rolls.
The directors of the campaign
hope to stimulate employment by
encouraging residents to renovate
their property, by starting a mild
building boom, and by asking all
those who can afford it to en-
ploy domestices and other persons
in personal service.
It is hoped that many of the
20,000 families on District relief.
rolls will be materially assisted
through this drive.

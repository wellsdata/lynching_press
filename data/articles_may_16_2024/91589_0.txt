NEW RICHMOND, KY., Aug. 21.- Immediately
after Anderson, a negro, who
choked Franklin Friedman to death last
night, was captured and taken to the city
jail this morning, shouts of" hang him,"
aroused the community. By 3 o'clock the
mob had quieted down and the marshal
tried to take the prisoner to the county jail
at Batavia. A deputy sheriff arrived and
an attempt was made to remove Anderson
before daylight. At 4 A. M. he was quietly
taken from jail.
The mob wrested Anderson from the
officers, dragging him a square away and
hanged him to a tree. The officers made
all possible resistance, but were overpowered
, as they thought the
had partly died out. excitement

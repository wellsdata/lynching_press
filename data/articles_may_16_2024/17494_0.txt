The professed friends of the independence of fest
nations and popular rights, they have not only
overthrown the Constitution of the United States
but the constitutions of the" Confederate States"
chemselves, refusing in every case to refer their poor
new usurpations to the votes of the people, thus
making themselves doubly traitors to both the ever
States and the nation. The despotic rulers over area
4,000,000 of enslaved Africans, they presume to the
extend over us, the white races of all nations, the has
sa.ne despotism, by ignoring the political rights
of all but their own class, by restrictions upon and
the popular franchise, by the suppression of the tion
freedom of speech and of the press, by the terrorism
of" Lynch law," or tyrannical enactments era
backed by standing armies, to crush cut the in- ent
dependence of thought, the ineradicable instiucts is
of our world- wide humanity, with the atrocious
dogma that negro slavery is the only basis of
real conservatism and progressive civilization, is
and that the true solution of the contest of all
time between labor and capital is that capital
should own the laborer, whether white or black.
The success of such demands would send the
tide of barbarism not only over the millions of
the New World and the isles of the western
oceans, but roll it back over England and emanci-
, pated Europe, and out from history this, the
greatest glory of our blot times.

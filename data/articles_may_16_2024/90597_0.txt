We ask and beseech the Savior of civilization, the Savior of
American institutions to take up his mantle and heed the Macedonian
cry: Come over and help us. The pregnant weeks of murder and
lynchings are fresh in our minds. The newspapers, the voices of
humanity pierce our ears and harrow up our souls with the fearful
crimes of, American democracy.

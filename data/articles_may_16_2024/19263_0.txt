parish.
Watkins Lewis was the fifth negro
put to death by a mob in this parish
within ten days, and the eighth in a
year. Two were lynched last week
for alleged implication in the killing
of Hicks and the robbery of his store,
and early last night two others were
taken from a deputy sheriff near
Shreveport after they are said to have
confessed to the killing of Cyrus Hotch-
kin, on old field worker, and hanged.
District Judge Bell today ordered the
grand jury to meet in special session
next Wednesday to investigate
lynchings. the

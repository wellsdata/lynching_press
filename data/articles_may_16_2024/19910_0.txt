JACKSON, Miss., August 13.- Saturday
night between the hours of 11 and 12 o'clock
,,
John Pesson was assassinated by some unknown
person. He lived about four miles
east of here. When the fatal shot was fired
he was going from his store to his residence
and was within seventy- five yards of it. The
coward that did the shooting waited until he
had gained the inclosure, and when his back
was turned fired a lead into his head from a
shotgun, which produced instant death. His
body was not discovered or the shooting
known until the next morning. He was a
respected and honored citizen of the county;
no man stood higher and had more friends or
fewer enemies than he. There is no clew to
the perpetrator. Great indignation prevails
in the community, and no stone will be
left unturned to ferret out the guilty party;
if found lynch law will undoubtedly be resorted
to. Tae returned a verdict in accordance
with the jury above.

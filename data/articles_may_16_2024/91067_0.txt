MOB BENT ON A LYNCHING KILLS
-
Alabama Negro Hackman Slain by
Crowd in Search of a Slayer.
Montgeomery, Ala., Octt. 7.- Sitting
upright in his hack, but dead from a
bullet wound in his heart, John Dell, a
Negro hackman of this city, was discovered
at 5 o'clock this morning. His
death at the hands of the- mob which
last night surrounded the county jail
and police headquarters is the only
tangible sign of the fury of the white
men who paraded the streets in thirst
for blood.
The mob, made up of 100 men, divid
into four parties at 1 o'clock this
morning and made a rush for the county
jail from four directions, with a view to
overpowering the jailer and taking John
Adams, the Negro, who killed Patrolman
W. T. Berry yesterday, and lynch-
him.
Sheriff Hood, with seven deputies
armed with shotguns, turned them
back. A call for all the police in town
to hurry to the jail was sent out and
they gathered there. The mob has dispersed
as the sheriff told it he would
,
kill the first man that approached the
jail.
Sheriff Hood deserves a golden medal
, for displyaing so much bravery,
and if all Sheriffs and other officers
suit it would be the end of
followed mob and lynch law.

the colored man.
Moore was shot and killed early on
the morning of May 23rd while out
autoing with Pearl Clark, white, of
Chicago. Feeling ran so high at the
time of the killing that it was feared
that Turner would be lynched, and
extraordinary precautions were taken
to prevent his in sight of
the National Capitol lynching.

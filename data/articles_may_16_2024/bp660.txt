Sheriff Robinson fired and killed
Mrs. Annie Lowman. Bertha Low-
man was shot twice in the left
breast just above the heart and
once through the abdomen. Clar-
ence Lowman was also severely in-
jured while Demon Lowman was
shot but not wounded seriously.
Sheriff Howard was killed by gun-
shot wounds and, in the first trial
three state's witnesses testified
that a pistol bullet went through
his head. The Sheriffs had pistols.
Clarence Lowman had a shotgun
while Demoh Lowman had a pistol
but at no time was anywhere near
Sheriff Howard or at a point where
he could have shot the Sheriff. In
the trial it was brought out that
the white men did not in any
manner indicate they were officers
of the law.
Hasty Trial Amid High Tension
"Five of the Lowmans were ar-
rested and moved hastily to the
penitentiary at Columbia to avoid
a lynching. According to the rec-
ord of the South Carolina State
Supreme Court, the shooting took
place on April 25, Howard's funer-
al on the 26th (at which were pres-
ent more than 200 Klansmen in
full regalia), inquest was held on
the 27th, the court convened on
May 4, the indictment of the Low-
mans was had the same day, the
defendants were arraigned on the
9th and placed on trial May 12
Feeling was so high in Aiken, ac-
cording to the defense brief in the
Supreme Court. it was published
to the world that it would be diffi-
cult to obtain lawyers for the Low-
mans in Aiken. Attorneys were
appointed by the court, who merely
went through the gestures of de-
fending them. in his charge to
the jury. Judge II. F. Rice, know-
ing of the danger to the lawyers,
even though appointed, by, the
court, apologized for the formal
defense made by them and im-
pressed upon the jury the fact that
'none of them wanted to do it.'
"Bertha, Demon and Clarence
were found guilty of murder with
a recommendation of mercy in the
case of Bertha. Demon and Clar-
ence were sentenced to die on Junc
12, 1925. and Bertha to life im-
prisonment. It is worthy of note
that Bertha and Clarence Low-
man's lives were hanging in the
balance from their wounds at the
time they were placed on trial and
they were taken from the hospital
to the court room.
"The caso was so outrageous
that N. J. Frederick, a colored at-
torney of Columbia, on his own
initiative, entered the case and filed
an excellent appeal to the State
Supreme Court for a review of
the cases, resulting in a reversal
of the convictions and the remand-
ing of the defendants for a new
trial.
"The
three defendants
were
again placed on trial October 5 at
Aiken, Judge Lanham presiding.
Mr. Frederick retained L. G. South-
ard, a white sttorney of Spartan-
burg, paying him $125 out of his
own pocket. Messrs. Frederick and
Southard put up a magnificent de-

motion was made for a direct ver-
brother and cousin, at
dict of not guilty in the case of
Demon Lowman. It was generally
conceded in Aiken that Clarence
and Bertha would be freed by the
jury the next day. At 5 in the
afternoon Judge Lanham granted
the motion for the dismissal of the
case against Demon. He was how-
ever immediately rearrested on a
charge of assault and battery and
recommitted to jail.
The Lynching Planned By
Ku Klux Klan
"Within one hour after the
Judge's decision, news had been
sent to as distant a point as Co-
lumbia that the 3 Lowmans were
to be lynched that night. : Within
the same hour, the Ku Klux Klan
held a meeting in the office of a
prominent white attorney of Aiken
who had been recently elected to
the State Legislature. At this
meeting plans were perfected for
the lynching and also plans were
discussed, but abandoned, to tar
and feather Mr. Fréderick and to
castrate Mr. Southard, the white
attorney. A prominent and re-
spectable white lawyer of Spartan-
burg warned Judged Lanham and
Solicitor Bert Carter that a lynch-
ing was in the air. Despite this
the Lowmans were committed to
ail with only one guard whereas
plans had been made to remove the
defendants should they be con-
victed,
"Shortly after midnight a police
officer of Aiken forced automo-
bilists to remove cars from around
the jail so that the lynchers would
have a place to park their cars.
According to reliable informants
Sheriff Robinson, Deputy Sheriffs
McElhaney and A. D. Sheppard,
and Traffic Policeman Salley
dragged Bertha Lowman from her
zell, got the other 2 defendants
and handed them over to the mob.
After the mob had secured the
prisoners 2 shots were fired inside
the jail and not, as Sheriff Robin-
son claimed, when he was trying
to prevent entry of the mob into
the jail.
"The mob numbering between 30
and 40 started out York Street on
che Dixie Highway to a tourist
camp about 2 miles from Ajken.
On the way Clarence Lowman
jumped from the car in which he
was held. He was shot down and
recaptured. In order to prevent
telltale blood marks, a rope was
tied to the back of the car and
the other end of it around Clar-
ence's body. In this manner he
was dragged about a mile to the
place of execution. The members
of the mob stated that Bertha
was the hardest one to kill. She
was shot but not killed instantly.
She dragged herself over
ground, and as one member of the
mob put it,' 'bleated like a goat.",
Another member of the
slightly more decent, said that she
begged so pitcously for her life
and squirmed about so that a num-
ber of shots had to be fired before
one found a vital spot and ended
her agony.

Facts Given to South Carolina's
Governor
have
"I have furnished Thomas G. Me-
Leod, Governor of South Carolina
in a 6-page letter, every detail re-
garding the lynching. I
given him the name of the member
of the mob who was accorded the
honor of being executioner but
whose nerve failed him. I have
furnished him with the names of
the three men who did act as exc-
cutioners and of their 2 assistants.
I have furnished him with the
names and addresses and occupa-
tions of 22 members of the mob
telling the Governor in detail of
the part played by each one of
them at the lynching. I have fur-
nshed him with the names of all
persons who were very close to the
lynching as spectators but who did
not actively participate in it.
"This list includes besides the
Sheriff and his deputies other-so-
called law-enforcement officers,
prominent business men and three
men related to the Governor and
the name of at least one member
of the Grand Jury investigating
the lynching. I also furnished the
Governor with the names of four
white men and one colored man
incarcerated in the Aiken jail on
the night of the lynching, and who
saw the Sheriff and his deputies
drag Bertha Lowman from her cell
and turn her over to the mob. I
have also stated to the Governor
that I can furnish him with the
names and addresse of most influ-
ential and respectable white citi--
zens of the community who will
testify to the correctness of the
facts set forth, if the Governor
protection
will guarantee them
from the vengeance of the Klan
and the lynchers.
Attempt To Stage Race Riot
"Following the lynching an at-
tempt was made to stage a race
riot to cover the guilt of the mur-
ders. Agents of the Klan went
around Aiken saying the Negroes
were armed and were going to
'rise in the night and kill all the
white people. The same tactics
were used as in the famous Phil-
lips County, Arkansas, riots of
1919, which the N. A. A. C. P. ex-
posed. Fortunately this dastardly
attempt did not succeed,
"I learned that the inevitable af-
termath of Klan activities is now
being seen in South Carolina. The
element of membership which acted
as a restraining influence in the
Klan and which entered the move-
ment believing it to be a law-
enforcement body as it claimed,
has largely resigned. The locai
Klans are now in the hands of
murderers, bootleggers, operators
of stills and other criminals.
As
I have said the law-abiding cle-
ment of whites are living in a state
of constant terror and indeed are
nore afraid of the Klan and of the
lower order of whites

White Men Armed For Defense
Against Klan
"In the home of one white man,
formerly a high officer in the Klan
and who resigned when he found
out the nature of the movement,
he showed me an automatic pistol
which he carried in his trousers
pocket and a 28 calibre reyolver in
a holster. He told me that if he
went only across the road in front
of his house after nightfall, a dis-
tance of some 75 feet, he strapped
on his person, in addition, a cart-
ridge belt and two 45 calibre army
revolvers.
"This man showed me a collee-
tion of 30 guns including rifles,
shotguns and revolvers which he
had in his home for self-protection.
For 4 years the members of the
Klan from which he has resigned
have been attempting to kill him.
The late Sheriff Howard, the pres-
ent Sheriff Robinson and the pres-
ent deputy sheriffs were all ex-
pelled from the Klan some years
ago for conduct unbecoming a
Klansman.' But they were later
readmitted. On the anniversary
of Sheriff Howard's death, the
Klan held a celebration at his
grave in the Graniteville Cemetery
at which, according to the Colum-
bia State, more than 1,500 persons,
many of them clad in Klan robes,
were furnished with free lunches
and lemonade and listened to culo-
gies of the late Sheriff. This cele-
bration took place while the State
Supreme Court was deliberating
on the appeal for a new trial for
the Lowmans.
"This makes the 41st lynching
I have investigated, besides 8 race
riots. In none of them have I
seen the depravity, barbarity, and
terrorism which exists in and near
Aiken. One of the white men with
whom I talked and who gave me
much valuable information, put his
hand on my shoulder as I was
leaving and said: 'Mr. White, work-
into your story the fact that you
were sent by God. For 7 weeks a
group of white people has met
here in my house every night and
prayed that some man from out of
the State be sent to open up this
mass of corruption and to publish
to the world the terrible state of
affairs prevailing here. You are
the answer to that prayer.'

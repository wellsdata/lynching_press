MOB SPIRIT UNIVERSAL.
An Ohio mob started to hang a sheriff for re-
disclose the hidden place of confine
,
fusing to
ment of a negro wanted for lynching purposes.
No better example could be asked of the great
truth that all blood looks equally acceptable to
bent murder. If these
mob collective
a on
estimable citizens of Ohio, the native state of
six presidents, the home of a culture, industry
and respectability second only to those of the
original thirteen states, could let loose to the
extent of all but murdering an officer of their
the
own election in duty he was sworn to perform
, what is to be said of the spirit of lynching
mobs in more primitive of the
country? parts
The plain truth of the matter is that a crowd
can seldom resist the chance to commit an en-
joyable murder and acquire merit in its own
eyes thereby. The lyncher operating on a
southern negro or an Ohio sheriff is in exactly
the same boat, one with the other.
The germs
of lynching are in Ohio as in Georgia
Florida or anywhere else. and
The explosive mixture in the human breast
Is that of blood lust with moral self- delusion.
The self- delusion is rarer in Ohio than in some
places, yet even there a mob of ordinarily re-
spectable persons can persuade itself of its duty
to slack the red thirst that wells up in its
throat. It proves the menace of the
brutal, degrading lynch doctrine. whole

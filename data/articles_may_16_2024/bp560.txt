been called upon to see that the
guilty are brought to justice."

ernor was very severe in his con-
demnation of the lynching and stat-
ed that he would leave no stone un-
turned in prosecuting every parti-
cipant in the crime no matter who
he might be." Mr. Nutter has com-

shall run the thing down and will
stay behind the officers and see
that they prosecute the case with,
vigor."

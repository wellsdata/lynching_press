Stevenson.
Negro Saved from a Lynching.
Moss Million, a negro, who cut and
perhaps fatally wounded Ray Sailors,
white, at Excelsior Springs, was taken
to Liberty, Mo., for safekeeping. After
Million's arrest street lamps were put out
and the officers, fearing an attempt to
lynch the negro, slipped him out of town.
Sailors cut on the neck and face and
will likely was die.

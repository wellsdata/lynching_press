AFTER FIASCO NEGRO. LYNCHED
Five White Men and Two Blacks Wounded
Before Louisiana Mob Meets Success.
Eola, La., April 16.- The sequel to the shooting
of five white, men and two negroes at Bunkie.
La., on Sunday, was the lynching of the negro
Charles Strauss near here to- day. Masked men
took him away from deputies who had arrested
him, and it is said the deputies offered no resistance
. The negro was hanged to a tree, after
which many shots were fired into his body. He
was charged with assault upon a white woman.
This was the second attempt in two days to
lynch Strauss, the first one on Sunday night
having resulted in the serious wounding of five
white men. Strauss had been taken from the
Bunkie jail and escaped in the darkness while
his captors were shooting at random. It is also
that negroes fired into the lynching
party alleged.

Earlier in Washington,
President Eisenhower refused
to support claims by some
congressmen that a federal
anti-lynching law is needed.

The murder can carry the
death sentence in Mississippi
and the President told
news conference that "I don't
know how you can make a law
stronger." The President did
not point out, however, that
no white man has ever been
given a death penalty for mur-
dering a colored man in Mis-
sissippi, the state that holds
the all-time record for lynch-
ings.
A CORONER'S jury ruled
Tuesday that Parker, who was
being held for trial on charges
that he criminally assaulted a
white woman, was "executed"
by two gunshots. Two bullets
in the chest killed him, said
Dr. W. H. Stringer, who per-
fornied the autopsy.
The coroner's jury report in-
ferred that Parker's killers
might have, after all, had
some mercy and compass i on
in their hearts. The man prob-
ably died instantly, it was
pointed out.
He was not
tortured or mutilated before
they killed him, the jury re
ported.

WHY WAS HIS head and
face so badly mutilated? It
could have been caused by de-
bris in the Pearl River brush-
ing against the body, they ex-
plained.
Prisoners in the jail from
which Parker was taken have
already told officers that the
white men brutally assaulted
Parker in his jail cell. Then,
as their helpless victim
screamed in pain, they drag-
ged him by the heels down
three flights of stairs, his
bleeding head bumping against
the steel stair treads all the
way. Waiting cars sped away
in the eerie night and Park-
er was never again seen alive.
Meanwhile, the FBI and
Mississippi authorities, sp u r-
red by world indignation over
the crime, "intensified their
efforts to learn the identity
of the members of the lynch
mob. There were some new
leads, it was stated. But FBI
agents declined to comment.

In a copyrighted story in the
Chicago Defender, Norman
James Malachi, 36, Lumberton
Miss., suid fellow townsm e n
told him of rumors that the
abductors "sure did a good
job," and "they outht to get
the other four next."
MALACHI WAS the second
witness to arrive in Chica g o
from Mississippi. Par ker's
brother in
law, Lee C.Un-
derwood, also of Lumberton,
earlier told newsmen that au-
thorities had tried to extort
a confession from him.
The newspaper said Satur-
day that Malachi, nicknamed
"Rainbow." traveled to Chi-
cago on bus money from his
sister, who lives there. He told
the Defender he last remem-
bered Parker's stopping at a
filling station the night of the
alleged rape, and then passed
out from heavy drinking and
recalled nothing until he ar-
rived home about midnight.
HIS COMPANIONS verified
his story, the newspaper said,
but authorities refused to be-
lieve Malachi, allegedly inti-
midating and beating him in
an effort to have him change
his story.

PARKER'S mother was not

body was discovered floating
in the Pearl River on Monday.

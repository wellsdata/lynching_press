On our first page, to- day will be
found an account of a horrible crime
committed in Hodgeman county,
Kansas, a week ago yesterday. The
writer giving the account, who is a
brother of the two ladies shot, will
be remembered as the young man
who assisted in arranging our office
and getting out the first issue of the
REGISTER. Mr. Lauber has many
old acquaintances in Lamar who will
regret to learn of the sorrow that
has invaded his family. A dispatch
received later, states that the blood
thirsty murderer was taken out by a
infuriated mob and hanged without
any seremonies, on Wednesday last
Nov. 10.,

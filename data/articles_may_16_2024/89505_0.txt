MORTON SPIRITED
AWAY FROM MOB
Negro Who Shot Virginia
Hurried to
Policeman Richmond
Richmond, Va., December 8.- Eli Mor-
ton, arrested today near Charlotte courthouse
and charged with the shooting of a
policeman of that place, was rushed here
tonight to prevent a possible lynching.
Monroe Dickerson, town sergeant of Charlotte
courthouse, was badly wounded by
the negro last Tuesday when the officer
attempted to arrest Morton.
The negro was captured today after a
pursuit with bloodhounds. He was lodged
in the county jail at Charlotte, but when
a crowd began to assemble officers
deemed it best to rush the negro to this
city.
When advised of the situation Gover-
nor Mann telegraphed Commonwealth Attorney
Atkins of Charlotte courthouse
that the prisoner must be protected from
mob law at all hazards. Governor Mann
took an active part in the condemnation
of the lynch law during the governors'
conference last week and offered the
resolution of censure directed against
the atitude of Governor Blease of
Carolina. South

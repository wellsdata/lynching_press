OTHERS WILL SWING.
Will Never Get Home Alive If Liberated
.
Special to the Globe.
MANDAN, N. D., Nov. 14.- Partles
here from down the Missouri river say
that the lynching of Coudot, Holy
Track and Ireland at Williamsport
is the direct result of the legal quibbling
of the supreme court in giving
a new trial to Coudot. No doubt what
ever exists of Coudot's guilt among
the people in Emmons county, and
they say they are tired of spending
thousands of dollars to secure convictions
merely to have them set aside
by the supreme court. Unless De
fender and Black Hawk, now in jail
in Bismarck, are protected by the government
, they will never get home
alive. When court meets Nov. 29, they
will be turned loose, as the authorities
tired of prosecutions that accom
are plish nothing.

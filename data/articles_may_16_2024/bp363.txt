Attorney
Louis. Assisting in the investigation

d
e Blanton reflected the attitude of
e most white southerners in his anal-.
of
ysis of the causes leading up to the
lynching. He said; "In my opinion
the lynching was the result of
e flaming anger by patriotic citizens
against a man who had attacked
d the wife of a man serving his coun
etry, rather than hatred for the Ne
gro population.
"I believe the same thing might
have happened to a white man,
but that the fact that the Negro
had a bad reputation and had pre-
aviously served time in prison for
burglary and larceny aggravated

Might Have Happened to
A White Man
Negro Placed In Women's Cell
1-..Ironically enough, the majority of
e white citizens here were more in
dignant over the fact that police of
ficials had put the wounded Ne-
ngro in a bed in the women's de-
tention ward of the jail, than they
were over possible repercussions
from the lynching. Blanton, when
called upon to "explain" issued a
statement that "the reason Wright
was placed in the women's deten-
tion ward, which has a wooden
door, was that he had three bul-
lets through his body and that was
the only place where there was a
cot. When police brought Wright
to the jall he was so weak he
could not stand. There is a ques-
tion as to whether he was even
alive when he was taken from the
jail.
Negroes Consumed With Fear
While Negroes here and in near-
by towns are
uncommunicative,
there is a pall of fear observable

Brands Lynching "A Blot"
tor,where Negroes are anticipating
a repetition of the spread of mob
violence that is still fresh in their
memories from the first World's
War and the five years folowing
it,
The lynching of Wright was the
third in Missouri in 11 years. Or
January 12, 1931, Raymond Gunn,
accused of assaulting a school
teacher in Marysville, was lynched.
On November 29, 1933,
Loyd 1
Warner, 19, accused of assaulting a
woman, in St. Joseph was lynched. 1
The Wright lynching marked the
24th Missouri lynching since 1900
and 9th since 1881.
Labor Trouble Is Factor
Indication that Southerners may
be resorting to mob tactics to keep
under control their supply of share-1
croppers and Negro workers, many
of whom
are either migrating
morthwards or making plans to do
ESO.
This tendency was reflected at
mearby Currutherville, just
60
on
miles south of Sikeston, where a
violent mob attack on a meeting of
sharecroppers of the Southern Ten-
ant Farmer's Union occurred
January 16. The mob threatened
the life of a white union organizer,,
W. M. Tanner, and broke up the
meeting of 60 farm laborers. The
Civil Liberties Unit of the Depari--
ment of Justice has been asked forr
an immediate investigation. Anoth-
er meeting was announced for Jan
muary 23, and the mayor of Curruth--
ersville was notified by Governorr
Donnell to give protection to the
sponsors of the meeting.
Communist Party Condemns
Already, the Communist Party
has issued a vigorous condemnation
of the Wright lynching as "viciouss
Hitlerism which endangers ourt
country and sabotages all that iss
being done to defeat Hitler andi
Hitlerism. The very interests of ourr
country against the menace
blodd thirsty Naziism demands ther
speedy and thorough prosecution off
those responsible".

lynching:
Mob Crime at Sikeston
Until supposedly civilized people
can submit to just law and curtb
their flaming lust for arbitary vent
geance,we cannot pretend to have
progressed far from a state of masss
barbarism The shameful lynching
at Sikeston is, indeed, as the Gov-
ernor called it, a blot on the Stateel
SIKESTON, MO.-(Special to the Call-Post)-100 per cent, lily
white Americans in this southeastern town of 8000 souls, proved to
America and the worll on last Sunday, that they could out-Hitler Hitler
in brutal savagry.
Some 1000 of them or about one-seventh of the
town's population stormed the flimsy town jail to participate in a
resurrection of Dixie's favorite spectacle, the lynching of a Negro!
of Missouri. More than that, it is
an example of mob passion that has
no palliation whatever.
The Negro, who was
dragged
through the streets, then burned in
gasoline, had committed an atro-
cious crime. There was no possible v
doubt of his guilt. He was caught
in the act and when arrested at 8
tacked the police officer.
What
jury anywhere would have failed to €
punish him to the limit? His act {
was wanton and ghastly. But the (
mob lust for his blood was scarce-
ly less disgraceful or ghastly.
Atempts to stay the
were said to have been made
hours by five law officers and the
Prosecuting Attorney. Meanwhile,
the crowd grew in numbers
menace. One of the avenues of in-
vestigation should be to determine
why, in the face of such increasing
threat ,officials did not send out a
call for more state troopers, more
deputies, to insure against violence.

A state and city investigation of
the lynching has been ordered. Gov.
Donnell has called for prosecution
of everyone in the death mob. Such
an inquiry is extremely difficult
But if this sort of mass crime is
to be obliterated, the investigation
must be thorough under the law, if
law is to be maintained as the
paramount organ of justice civilized
sell existence demands.

The mob stormed city
thrusting aside
several
guards and the County Prosecutor
who had pleaded with it for sev-
eral hours, and dragged from the
Negro,
jail a critically wounded
Cleo Wright, who is said to have
admitted stabbing the wife of a
white soldier, and who slashed the
officer who arrested him. Wright
had been critically wounded by the
fired
arresting officer, who had
three shots into his body.
The mob thrust their wounded
victim into a waiting automobile,
cramming him into a trunk com-
partment, and with the mob, in-
cluding many women, following,
drove to "Sunset", the sector where
the town's 600 Negro residents live.
There they bound their victim's
body with heavy rope and dragged
it up and down the streets of the
Negro sector.

An hour later the body was cut
loose, splashed with gasoline
set afire. While the human pyre
burned in the streets, and Negroes

The chief of police immediately
ordered all Negroes confined
their homes, except those working
on late shifts in hotels, bus
train stations ,and carloads of de-
puties, many of them recent mob
members, were sworn in to patrol
the Negro district in order to pre-
ven race riot.

By Tuesday an atmosphere
calm has settled over the town, and
the body of the 30-year-old cotton-
seed worker had been placed into a
pine box, sans autopsy, and buried
by City Street Department workers
in an isolated section of the Car-
penter-Cemetery at near-by McMul-
len, a smaller community.
Negro undertakers here had de-
clined to handle the body and ev-
en Wright's mother, who was ins
formed at her home in Arkansas,
and his wife and her parents here,
refused to claim the body, which
the
had been abandoned after
lynch orgy,and permitted to lie ex-
posed on a downtown street.

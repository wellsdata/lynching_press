DISAGREEMENT OF JURY.
Alleged Lynchers at Springfield,
Mo., to Go Free.
After being out twenty- three hours, the
Jury in the case of Doss Galbraith, charged
with leading the mob which lynched
three negroes in Springfield, Mo .. on the
night of April 14, reported to the court
that no agreement could be reached and
was discharged. The jury stood ten for
acquittal and two for conviction through
twenty ballots. The Galbraith case was
reset upon the docket, but it is doubtful
if there will be another trial. The three
negroes were taken from jail, hanged to
the statue of Liberty and then burned by
the mob because of an attack on a white
woman. No negroes were on the streets
the city after the jury retired and they
of kept out of sight all day and night.

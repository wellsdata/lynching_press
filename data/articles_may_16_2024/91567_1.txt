Is Locked Up.
PHOENIX, Ariz., Feb. 8.- A special to
the Arizona Republican from Yuma says:
Mrs. Joseph Burns was shot and killed in
a dispute over a piece of land fifteen miles
southwest of here yesterday by Marion
Alexander, a constable.
The Burns family had been occupying
the land for several years, but various
complications in the title preventing making
an entry. A man named Miller made
homestead Constable
a and Alexander,
carrying out instructions for obtaining
possession of the land for Miller, engaged
in a dispute which resulted in the shooting
of Mrs. Burns.
Alexander surrendered himself to the authorities
and to save him from threatened
lynching he was placed in the Territorial
Prison for safe keeping. The Coroner's
jury found that the woman had come to
her death" under circumstances not en-
excusable, but under mitigating oir-
tirely cumstances."

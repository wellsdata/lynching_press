Four Negroes Lynched.
CHARLESTON, S. C., April 5.- At 4:30 o'clock
this morning about sixty undisguised men
forcibly entered the jail at Yorkville, and, breaking
open the cells, seized Giles Good, Bailey
Bowdle, Prendley Thompson and Mose Lips-
comb, negroes, charged with the murder of John
Lee Good, a young white lad, in December last.
Taking the prisoners a mile north of the village,
they hanged them to the limbs of trees. These
men organized a conspiracy, in the fall of 1886,
to steal cotton, and murder, if necessary, to conceal
their crimes, and they killed young Good.
The prisoners were to have been tried this week,
but the lynchers got ahead of the law

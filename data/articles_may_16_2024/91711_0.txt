from Camp Thomas says: Major McLellan
assumed command of the post this morning.
Seven officers left this morning for Fort
Grant, to attend the Court- martial.
A Citizen's special from Lordsburg, N. M.,
says: Judge Lynch has again held sway.

Sandy Kirg, two lucitless members of the
noted cowboy gang, who had recently been
arrested for dealing in stolen stock, were taken
to Shakespeare for trial, which Judge Lynch
proceeded to execute in his own peculiar

and seizing the guard, hanged the two unhappy
men to a joist until dead. King died

a word in self- defense. Dittenborn wanted

him up with his words in his mouth. Little
sympathy is expressed by the people here
the unlucky men. for

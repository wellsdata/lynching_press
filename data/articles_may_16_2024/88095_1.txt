HISTORY OF THE CASE
,
About one week before the above
occurrence this man Nelson had some
difficulty with an old negro named
an Betts, who lived near Varner, about
some rents. Betts went to Nelson's
house to settle up the matter about
some rents due Betts' mother- in- law
which they claimed Nelson had received
from a man named Hill with
instructions that the money be turned
off over to the women. Nelson denied
having received the money. This
at brought about a quarrell and without
any warning Nelson suddenly
drew an ax struck old man Betts a
blow and severed his right leg from
his body. The old man fell prostrate
to the ground and his assailant jumped
on him with both feet and stamped
him to death. Nelson was arrested
and placed in jail at Varnar. On
the night of the 13th of November
- last the aboved named negroes indicted
for murder went to the jail at
Varnar, broke it open got possession
of Nelson and completly riddled his
body with bullets and afterwards
tried to set it on fire. The officers at
once proceeded to arrest the parties
engaged in the lynching. Judge J.
M. Elliott and Pros. Atty. Smith C.
Martin went to Varner and aided
Sheriff Meroney, of Lincoln county
in the detection and arrest of the
guilty parters. Yancy Hawking who
was the leader of the mob made a
confession when arrested, giving the
names of all the other parties. Beyond
doubt Nelson would have expiated
his crime with a hangsman's rope
about his neck. He however was
the victim of the hellish and infuriated
mob, but now his lynchers will
reap their just reward at the hands
of the law that they boldly
and trampled under their feet ignored.

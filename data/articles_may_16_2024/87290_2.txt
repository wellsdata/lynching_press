BISMARCK, N. D., Nov. 15.- A formal
inquiry was begun today into the
cause of the death of the three men
lynched at Williamsport last night.
So far as known, there has been no
identification of any of the lynchers.
Black Hawk and Defender, the two
men confined in jail here, have been
taken to the penitentiary for safe
keeping, it being feared that an attack
might be made upon the jail here. Re
ports from Standing Rock state that
there is no excitement among the In
dians, and that some of them express
a feeling of relief at the end of the
matter, although they regret the manner
of death of the men, of course.
Attorney R. N. Stevens, who conducted
the defense of Coudot and secured him
a new trial, today received the following
telegram from J. D. Flynn, a resident
of Winona:" Allow me to ex
tend you my congratulations on
ing Coudot." sav

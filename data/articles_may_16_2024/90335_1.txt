GRIM FRUIT ON TREES.
An Arkansas Mob Avenges the Murder of a
White Man.
CAMDEN, Ark., July 15.- About 12
o'clock Saturday night at Hampton, 30
miles east of here, two negroes were
mobbed by seventy- fi e men. Two
weeks ago a white man by the name
of Martin was killed by three negroes.
Two of them were arrested and confined
in jail. A mob gathered several
nights ago, but were persuaded to desist.
Last night there was another gathering
, and seventy- five determined men
marched to the jail and demanded of
the sheriff the surrender of the murderers
. It was useless to resist such a
force with but a handful of men to
summon to his aid, so the keys were
delivered to the mob. The culprits
were carried to the neighboring forest
and hanged to trees. The men were
not masked, and made no effort to conceal
their identity. Two years ago a
race riot occurred in Calhoun county.
The negroes greatly outnumber
whites, and further trouble is expected the.

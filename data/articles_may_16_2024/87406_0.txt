Lynch Law- Abolitionists,& c.
In our last number we published an
account of the arrest of THREE PERSONS
in the parish of St. Helena, La., suspected
of distributing seditious pamphlets,
and who afterwards acknowledged they
belonged to the Murrell gang, and that
one had made his escape, and sentence
had not been passed upon the other two.
Our information now enables us to state,
that the two in custody were tried by
the citizens, and the charges being fully
proved they were sentenced to be hung
forthwith,!

Judge Pelham and St. Clair.
A man in a position to have full information
concerning all the facts relating
to the recent trial of Jim Brown in St.
Clair County- a man known and honored
all over Alabama, speaking yesterday, entirely
without the knowledge of Judge
Pelham or Governor Jelks, said:
" Judge Pelham about a month ago proceeded
to Ashville, and called a meeting
of the citizens, at which meeting was
a large number of representative men
from various parts of the county. It was
the unanimous sentiment and sense of
that meeting that it would be unwise,
impolitic and dangerous to bring a body
of soldiers to guard the prisoner during
in that meeting
his trial. The men
themselves to use their best ef

forts to see the law enforced in an order
upon, condition that no mill
manner,
ly
tary guard should be brought into the
county. Judge Pelham accepted the
pledge, and these men have spent the
creating a sentiment in favor of
time in
a decent and orderly trial, and it is safe
to say that nine- tenths of the people of
St. Clair County readily responded to
this sentiment, and commend Judge Pelham
for the course he pursued. And it
is a significant fact that the guards, who
were sworn in as deputies, and who took
an oath to uphold the law at the cost of
their lives, were largely men from and
Springville, where the dastardly
around crime was committed.
" I think too much praise cannot be
given to the guards who voluntarily assumed
the responsibility of upholding the
law, and especially should the untiring
efforts of Judge W. S.
and courageous
Formon, the probate judge of St. Clair
County, be commended. He it was who
organized and picked the guard, and he
remained until the negro was taken away.
" There were only a very few men in
sympathy with the would- be lynchers,
and this latter class was composed of
certain reckless, lawless fellows, such as
you find in every county. They never

show you that the crowd as a whole
was orderly, I mention the fact that once
during the progress of the trial, and
again after the trial was over, upon a
mere request of the judge, the crowd,
which packed the court house, cleared
the room almost to a man. A short time
after the sentence was passed the shooting
occurred, and at that time not a man
of all that assemblage, numbering probably
fifteen hundred, remained in the
court house, except those who were properly
there.
" Upon the whole, it is a great victory
for the people of St. Clair County, and
it has taught a wholesome lesson to the
lawless element, which in St. Clair County
, is largely in the minority.
" I know the people of that county, although
I do not live there, and I have
no hesitancy in saying that taken as a
whole, the citizenship of the county is
the equal of that of any other county
in the state in the respect entertained
for the law.
" No, sir; there was no need of military

guards, and the sending of them to St.
Clair County would, in my humble judgment
, have been a serious mistake. The
good people of that county demonstrated
their willingness and ability to maintain
the enforcement of the law and that, too,
under the most trying circumstances,
and no one could ask any more of them
that"

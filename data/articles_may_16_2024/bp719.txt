of resolutions which were unanimous-

meeting was to raise money to send
representatives from Pittsburgh and
Allegheny county to Governor Tener
to present resolutions concerning the
lynching. Many heated speeches
were made. Rev. Broadax Smith in
characteristic vein voiced the senti-
ment of the occasion. He said in
part:

Attorney Frank R. Stewart made
the speech of the evening showing
them that all the talk and bickering
back and forward was a foolish waste
of time. He explained the object
of the meeting to provide money to
avenge the foul blot on the state of
Fennsylvania. His speech was force-
ful, maniy and direct. He held the

It was decided to appoint a com-
mittee to prepare for a big mass
meeting in which they hope every
race loving and true minded citizen
of Pittsburgh will participate. Some
of the expense was raised in a collec-
ticn. The meeting is to be held Sun-
day, August 20. at Bethel A. M. E.
church, Wylie avenue, at 3 o'clock p.
Notices have been sent to all of
the Negro churches in Allegheny
county and an immense crowd is ex-,
pected. There will be no more
"resoluting," but-an earnest attempt
will be made to raise cash to send off
the committee of three and to decide
on the proper course to pursue in or-
der to make sure that the perpetra-
tors of the outrage are not allowed
to escape
full justice. Governor
Terer has been asked for a date at
which he will entertain the resolution
committee.

the
wharf and immediately went along side.
When Captain Bayliss was informed of their
errand he denied that there was any negro on
board, and very readily consented to be
searched. On going into the cabin and rais
the floor Mr, Eppes' negro girl was found
stretched out at full length, with barely
room to breath. At first Mr. Eppes did not
recognize her, as she was dressed in Man's
clothing. Continuing the search in the hold,
under a bridged space, over which the wheat
had been stowed, four other negroes were
found, all men- Mr. Eppes' Frederick, Mr.
Kevan's John Bull, Mr. John Hare's Joc,
and another man belonging to Mr. Hamilton.
The captain, after the finding of the negroes,
owned up, and said he had been negotiated
with for their passage by a negro aan. The
Townes" took the schooner in tow
6.
and
brought her to this city, where on the wharf
more than a thousand people waited to re-
ceive her, news of her coming up the river
having preceded her.- On her arrival the
feeling among the crowd was very intense,
and it was with the utmost difficulty that the
prisoners could be got away. Besides the
captain, there was only one man on the
schooner: both of them were tied, and in
that conditon hurried through the crowd.
We noticed some demonstration towards
lynching them, but with the assistance of the
Mayor, Sergeant Stewart and Bailiff Butts,
was checked at once. it

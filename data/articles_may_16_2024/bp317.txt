TALLAHASSEE, Fla.-Efforts of
two Madison county grand juries
to absolve Sheriff Lonnie T. Davis
of any connection with the recent
lynching of Jesse James Payne, a
Negro youth, backfired last week
when Florida's Gov. Millard Cald
well declared that the "stupidity"
of the officer was responsible for
the state's 1945 disgrace.
The governor asserted that "stu-
pidity" had been proved against
Davis but that he would not be
removed from office.
The state's chief executive ád-
mitted that his investigators had
uncovered evidence in the circum-
stances leading up to the lynching
of Payne to prove the sheriff's un-
fitness for office but that he was
the "choice of the people of Madi-
son County. Stupidity and inepti-
tude are not sufficient grounds for
the removal of an elected official
by he governor."
Issues Warning
He warned, however, that in the
future, “particularly in cases of this
kind, I expect the highest degree
of care to be exercised."
The governor said the state's in-
vestigation of the lynching indi-
cated that Sheriff Davis "did not
participate in the crime and did
not intentionally make its commis-
sion possible."
Payne, accused of molesting a
five-year-old white child, said to be
a niece of the sheriff, was taken to
Madison on October 9 to stand trial
in the case from the state prison at
Raiford, where he had been placed
for safe-keeping. He had pleaded
not guilty and was scheduled to be
tried on October 18.
Lynch Threats Ignored
Despite previous lynch threats
against the life of the Negro youth,
he was put in an unguarded Madi-
son county jail. On July 4 a posse-
mob shot the terror-stricken boy
at Monticello. He was rescued by
state officers and placed under ar-
rest. Further threats were made
to lynch him after he had been
taken in custody.
Late in the night of October 10
or early in the morning of October
11, Payne was "quietly" removed
from the jail by an "orderly" mob.
and shot to death. After dawn his
body was found seven miles away
near a highway.
Sheriff Davis was the only per-
son who had keys to the jail and
the cells. The jail, which is located
on a lot adjoining the sheriff's
home, is surrounded by a high wire
fence. There are people in Madison
who whisper that the officer knows
who the members of the mob were,
was in conspiracy with them, and
was standing at a window in a
nightshirt at his home watching the
mob when it entered the jail and
removed the hapless Negro youth

January 2, 1849.
Every newspaper I see from the States,( and they are
mighty few,) contains one or more letters from out here
somewhere, giving the most awful description of things
here imaginable- horrible murders. outrageous thefts,
hanging people by scores on trees, Lynch law,& c.,& o.
Now as one of our company has made as much as he
thinks will do him, and is going home, they have all
agreed and requested that I should give you by his
hands a little history of how we do things in our" dig-

whole number who have signed the by- laws being 153.
Our place of rendezvous is a large oak tree, on a beautiful
hill, out of which gushes as pure a stream of
water as was ever drunk by man. You ought to see
that tree. It looks as though it had been topped about
200 years ago, and had never stopped spreading.
At ten o'clock the secretary reads the by- laws, after
which the president rises and says:" Does any member
know of any violation of the laws just read?" to
which, three times out of five, there is no response;
and since I have been a member, which is about eight
months, there has been no offence committed( with
one exception) that received a higher punishment
than a small fine, or a reprimand from the president.
The exception alluded to was a poor devil who was
detected in hiding a portion of the day's labor of his
company. The members thereof, consisting of nine,
immediately held a meeting among themselves, gave
him his part of their joint earnings,( which was about
$ 3,000). and told him to go, as he knew what would be
his fate next Sabbath. He accordingly went, and
not been beard of since. has

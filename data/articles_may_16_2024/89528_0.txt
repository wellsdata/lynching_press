AN OHIO SENSATION.
Double Homicide at New Straitsville- The
Murderer Lynched by a Mob.
COLUMBUS, May 21.- Marshal Henry Aver, of
New Straitsville, O., while in a quarrel with
Albert Guest, on the streets of that place, today
, was shot by the latter several times, in
different parts of the body, and reports to- night
state that he cannot recover. One shot missed
Aver and hit a boy aged eleven years, fifty
yards away, passing through his body and injuring
his spine so that he cannot recover.
Guest loaded his revolver and endeavored
to escape, firing on two of Pinkerton's men, who
followed him, but they compelled him to surrender
, and he was locked in jail. Strong threats
of lynching were indulged in, and trouble is
feared before morning. Reports as to the
trouble between the men are conflicting, one
being that Aver was about to serve a warrant
for the arrest of Guest, and another that they
were talking over some trouble had in the
country the previous evening.
LATER. Two hundred masked men broke
into the prison, at 10 o'clock, and compelled the
constable, at the muzzle of a revolver, to give
up the keys. They secured Guest and took him
out near Plumber Hill mine, where they
him to a tree and riddled his body with bullets hanged.

$ 1,000 Reward to a Mob who will Lynch a
White Man.
CHICAGO, July 13.- John Paul Logan of St.
Paul publishes in the Times a card as follows:" I will
pay$ 1,000 reward to any mob who will lynch a white
man for murdering a negro in the South, or for outrag.
ing a negro woman in the South. The daily lynching of
negroes in the South is like the handle of a jug, all on
one side, and, just to vary the monotony and see a refreshing
change, I will send the above amount to any
enterprising Southern mob who will change the pro
gramme for once and give one of their white murderers
a piece of rope. I would suggest that the county Sheriff
where the mob operates should be elected captain of the
mob and authorized to draw on me for the$ 1,000, which
will be paid spot cash at the First National Bank of St.
Paul immediately upon receipt of credible information
that the mob has changed the programme. I am heartily
disgusted with your nigger corpses. Now let your irrepressible
great American mob bestir themselves and
give us white corpse for breakfast, and the very
devils in one hell will rise up and thank them."

DEAD BODY FOUND IN THE RIVER .-- The
body of a man was found floating in the river
on Saturday, opposite Wm. Bisland's plantation
- at the woodyard of which it came ashore
and was buried by Mr. Bishland's hands. The
body was so much mutilated that it was impossible
to form any idea of his age or personal
contour. His fright hand and lower jaw were
off- there was a large hole through his body
which looked as though he had been shot, and
two of his ribs were broken. He had on satti.
nett pantaloons and callicoe shirt. One$ 50
Miss.& Alabama note and 50 cents in specie
was found in his watch pocket. Capt. Shaw,
of the Phoenix ferry boat, saw the body pass our
city on Saturday at 12 o'clock, and supposes
is one of those who were lynched in Ar-
he kansas.

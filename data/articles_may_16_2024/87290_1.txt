GRAND FORKS, N. D., Nov. 15.
" The mob who lynched the Indians at
Williamsport hung an innocent
man, and I have ample documentary
evidence of that fact." Such were
the words of Chief Justice Corliss to
night. In an interview the chief justice
continued substantially as follows:
" Coudot, in whose case a new trial was
recently ordered by the state supreme
court, was convicted on the unsupported
evidence of two others, who were
confessed murderers, and in the face
of the strongest kind of an alibi by
Dr. Ross, agency physician of Standing
Rock, whose positive statement that
Coudot was at home and acted as interpreter
for him at the very time of
the murder is sustained by the doctor's
memorandum book, in which a note
was made at the time of his visit. The
doctor's veracity is unquestioned. A
further fact is that the two self- con
fessed murderers above referred
to,
Phillip Ireland and Paul Holy Track,
had made two previous confessions, in
neither of which did they implicate
Coudot. The lynching of the two con
fessed murderers may not be so reprehensible
, but there is no question what
ever but they would have hung for
their crime had the law been allowed
to take its course But the
. lynching
of Coudot was as foul a murder, as unjustifiable
and as hideous as the murder
of the Spicer family. Coudot was
only a half- breed, but the murder is
no less a crime on that account, and
the lynching is a most deplorable
some." out

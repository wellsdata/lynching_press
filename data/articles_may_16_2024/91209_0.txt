FIT END TO A CAREER OF CRIME- A man
named Edward W. Hawkins was hanged at
Irvine, Kentucky, on the 29th ult. for murder
. He was not quite 21 years of age at
the time he paid the penalty of violated
laws; yet he confessed that he had murdered
four persons, and married six wives, one of
whom committed suicide on discovering his
character. This is a specimen of total depravity
.
In connection with this instance of youth-
ful depravity, we may notice the fact, as it
is stated to be, that a majority of the mob
at the late election riot in Washington city
was composed of boys under 18 years of
age; and that the mob which hanged some
negroes in Louisville recently was mainly
composed of the same materials.
The present generation of men is none too
good, it must be confessed; but the prospects
for the next are certainly
worse. Fayetteville considerably Observer.

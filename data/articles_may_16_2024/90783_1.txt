Hon. R. G. Pleasant, Gov.,
Baton, Rogue, La.
Press dispatches in New
York papers report that three
Negroes whose names were
given as Jim Lewis, Jim Jones
and Will Powell, were lynch-
ed near Delhi, La., Tuesday,
February 25, as the outgrowth
of trouble between whites and
Negroes, the lynched colored
men having been accused of
stealing hogs. The National
Association for the Advancement
of Colored People, composed
of representative citi.
zens of both races, most emphatically
protests against
this defiant disregard of the
laws of your State and against
this indefensible attack upon
the morale of this nation at a
time when justice and law enforcement
at home are essential
to national prestige abroad
. We protest not only
in the name of our ninety
branches and ten thousand
members for whom we speak
directly but in the name of
the name of the law- abiding
citizens of the whole country
who feel chagrined, humiliat.
ed and outraged that in the
states of our nation mobs are
allowed to take the law into
their own hands and wreck
vengeance upon men because
they happen to be black.
These outrages, we would
remind you, are not a matter
of state concern alone but affect
the whole nation. Such
acts as this mob lynching be-
cause of alleged hog- stealing
put the President and the
United States in a most embarrassing
and difficult posi-
tion when the executive of
the country seeks to protest,
however rightfully, against
outrages committed in Bel-
Armenia.
gium or
This is the second Louisiana
lynching reported within thirty
days by the press of the
country. No reply has yet
been made by you to our inquiry
of February 6 for information
as to any action you
might deem fitting to take in
the circumstances of a Negro
lynched on January 26. For
the information of the news-
papers of the country which
receive our regular press service
, we inquire what action
you as Governor propose to
take to uphold the laws of
to Louisiana.
( Signed) John R. Shillady,
Secretary National Association

Colored for People.

Paris, October 25.- An enterprise started
by the Matin which consisted of concealing
in the city a treasure, the whereabouts
of which was indicated in a serial
story running in the paper, caused trouble
here today. A crowd was seeking
the treasure in the Butte Chaumont park
this morning when a man drove up in a
cab, alighted, and immediately found it.
The crowd declared that the finder was
employed by the paper and had been told
where to look. They tried to lynch him
and he was saved with difficulty. Subsequently
eight hundred persons marched
to the office of the Matin where they
made a bonfire of copies of the paper,
and threatened to wreck the premises.
The police had a hard task in
the mob. dispersing

FOUND. BE MUST REMEDY SOME
The unlawful and prejudiced practices
of inhuman mobs has become of
such magnitude that the public is becoming
alarmed. Not only have innocent
as well as guilty Negroes paid
the price of death at the hands of a
mob, but now it is becoming a custom
to lynch any offender- white or
black. Mob violence is spreading at
an enormous rate. Grave fears are
entertained in regard to the safety
of citizens wherever such spirit manifests
itself. Communities which
have always been considered the
abiding places of law- abiding, liberty-
loving people have been brought to
few
through acts of a
shame the
characters not men- who have no
-
self- respect, no regard for the morals
the community. Little was it
of
thought by the general public that
the folly of such depradations would
upon the white man. But now
react
no man is safe- when crime or suspicion
points toward him. Yes, white
men are being lynched. Only a few
days ago a white man was lynched
in Missouri Some remedy must be
found..

DEATH CHEATED
MOB OF VICTIM
NEGRO WAS SHOT IN LEG AND
DIED BEFORE MINERS COULD
STRING HIM UP- NOT A MAN
MASKED.
J
Marshfield, Ore., September 18- Alonzo
Tucker, a negro, who assaulted Mrs.
Dennis
near Liboey yesterday
, was
lynched today. A body of coal miners
heavily armed marched into town last
evening. The marshal who had Tucker
in custody attempted to take him from
the jail just as the miners entered and
a rush was made for the negro. He managed
to give his custodian the slip and
jumped under the wharf into the mud
flats, and eluded both officers and mob
until today. The miners stationed armed
guards at every point of egress from the
city.
The patrol was kept up all night and
at one time there was loud talk of lynching
the officers who allowed Tucker to
escape. Every corner of the town was
searched and finally two boys located the
fugitive under a store.
The boys fired
at him with air guns and drove him from
his hiding place. As he emerged a ball
from a rifle caught him in the right leg.
Tucker ran into the store and was followed
by the miners who started to string
him up in the store but they decided to
take him to the scene of his crime. A
start was made but the negro died from
his wound and the mob hanged him to a
beam the South Marshfield
on bridge.
There was not a masked man in the
crowd and everything was done in
daylight. broad

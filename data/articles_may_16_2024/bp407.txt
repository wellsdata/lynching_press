Pickens Says Mobs
Are Biggest Liars;
Newspapers Next!
N. A. A. C. P. Executive Demands Correction On Ev-
erybody's Complete Encyclopedia's Reference
and Explanation of "Mobs."A.
YORK, Nov. 4â€”( ANP) -- A letter by Dean Wil
In his letter to
to the Whitman
Publishing company of Racine,
Wis., which brings out the encyclo-
pedia, Mr. Pickens said he turned
to the topic of "Lynch Law" on
page 450 and read, "Colored per-
sons who has committed or were
suspected of having committed
some crime against white women
have been the most frequent vic-
tims of lynching or "necktie' par-
ties."
"Out of 5.000 and more lynch-
ings in a little over 50 years, the
mobs that did the lynching accuse
less than 20 out of every 100 vic-
tims of any crime against women,"
he wrote the publishers. "In fact.
the accusations by the mob of
the specific crime of rape comprise
only about 16 per cent of the
victims.
That disqualifies your
statement absolutely, and I might
add further that mobs are about
the biggest llars on earth next to
newspapers and certain publica-
tions."
Mr. Pickens said the N.A.A.C.P.
has a special committee, headed
by Dr. Charles Edward Russell of
Washington, for the purpose of
correcting misinformation, and of-
fered its service to Whitman's.
In its reply, the publishing com-
pany thanked Mr. Pickens for call-
ing the matter to its attention and
said, "If you will have Dr. Rus-
sell write a statement for us which
he believes to be correct, we should
be glad to revise our statement to
accord with the facts."

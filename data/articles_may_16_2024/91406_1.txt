--On Friday last a Canadian laborer,
who had been worsted in a fight with one
of his fellow- workmen, got up in the night
and stabbed his late antagonist to the heart
with a butcher knife, whereupon the other
laborers arrested the murderer, tried him
before a jury selected from their own party
, convicted him, and hanged him on the
spot. And now twelve of these conservators
of the peace are under arrest on the
charge of murder. The affair occured

Whether a railroad that carries
a mob to a town to lynch a man is
liable for damages to the victim's
widow and children, is a puique
before the Su-
to be brought
point
Court of the United States. The
case will be presented today with
a request to review. Mrs. Annie
May Rodgers, and three children
sued the Vicksburg, Shreveport&
Railroad Company, on
Pacific charges of having carried by spec-
ial train, a mob from Monroe, La.,
to Tallulah, La., where Rodgers
was lynched. He had been charged
with murdering a man and was
about to be released on the ground
that he had been tried once before
on the charge. The lower Federal
Court held that as a matter of law
the railroad might be liable.,

LYNCHED IN MISSOURI
HALF- BREED DESPERADO
Mindee Chowagee Taken From Jail
and Strung Up on a Tree in
the Yard.
MARSHALL, Mo., April 28.- Mindee
Chowagee, the negro- Indian who escaped
from jail here on Thursday night after
assaulting Sheriff Joseph Wilson and his
little son and shooting the Sheriff's wife
in the arm when she came to their assistance
, was lynched at 11:30 to- night by a
mob of angry citizens. The lynchers
forced an entrance to the jail, meeting
with slight resistance at the hands of the
officers, and dragged the prisoner out into
the jail yard, where he was strung up to a
tree.
Chowagee was recaptured at 10 o'clock
last night ten miles southeast
of Marshall
. He rode up to a farmhouse on a
stolen horse and asked for something to
eat. He was invited in, and while he sat
at the table the farmer and one of his
men covered him with two shotguns, ordering
him to throw up his hands. He
obeyed and was bound hand and foot and
brought back to Marshall.
Chowagee was under arrest on a charge
of burglary. John Smith, the negro prisoner
who joined with Chowagee the assault
upon the Sheriff, is still at in large.

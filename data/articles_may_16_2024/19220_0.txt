Charleston, W. Va., Aug. 15.- Mobs
are gathering in every mining town
within a radius of twenty- five miles
of Quinnmont, W. Va., tonight intent
upon lynching a negro who assaulted
and murdered Mrs. John Arliss, the
wife of a miner of Quinnmont. Arliss
and his bride of three weeks were
walking along a railroad track last
night when a negro attacked them,
and after beating Arliss until he was
left for dead, turned his attention to
Mrs. Arliss, whom he assaulted and
then murdered. Arliss regained consciousness
this morning, and crawled
to the railroad shops. A search soon
revealed the dead body of his wife.
Posses which were started out in all
directions succeeded in arresting two
suspects and a lynching cannot be
averted in case Arliss can identity
of the men. one

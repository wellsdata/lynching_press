FBI Scored For Failure
To Solve Ga. Lynchings
WASHINGTON — (ANP)~ Na-
tional criticism was directed last
week at the Federal Bureau of In-
vestigation for its failure to solve
the July 25 lynchings of two Ne-
gro conples in Monroe, Georgia.—
of the ļ
Miss
A legislative representative
National Negro congress.
Dorothy Funn, remarked how in-
credible that in all this time the
FBI agents haven't found a single
clue which would lead them to the
murderers."
Not even the $42,000 rewards have
been able to help the FBI uncover
the lynchers, who are said to have
threatened would-be informers with
violent reprisals, including death
Handicapped FBI agents are now
waiting for the "hent" to subside,
It was learned, and report reluc-
tance of witnesses to give infor-
mation to "the feds."
The FBI has not reduced the
size of its agent's squad in Mon-
roe and has been ordered by Atty.
General Tom Clark to "stay with
the case until it is solved." Period-
ic reports of the agents' progress
in the case are sent to President
Truman, generally accompanied by
J. Edgar Hoover's confidence in its
eventual solution.
Department of Justice officials
decline to comment on criticism
of their agents' failure or report
on the progress of their investiga-
tlon. Withdrawal of Georgia law
enforcement agencies from
the
case now leaves the investigation
in the hands of the FBI which is
involved only on the theory that
federal civil liberties statues may
have been violated,
The federal government can act
only if evidence reveals a con-
spiracy or the failure of law en-
forcement agencies to give proper
protection to a prisoner. According
to the department of justice plans
now, FBI agents will solve the
crime, arrest the lynchers and turn
them over to the state for prosecu-
tion in the absence of an anti-
lynch law.

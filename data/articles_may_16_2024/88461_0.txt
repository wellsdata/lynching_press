will cure him.
In this connection the figures recently
Tribune
published by the Chicago
should be given. They show that homicides
are the chief cause of the lynch-
the south. The
ings, particularly in
lynchings of 1897 were as follows:
Alabama ... 13 Indiana 5
....
Texas .25 Oklahoma 2
Arizona 2 Nevada ... 2
Maryland 1
Virginia 5 ...
Arkansas ..11 Ohio 1
North Carolina 1 Mississippi ..16
Florida .... 12 South Dakota 2
*****
Alaska 3 Missouri 4
Georgia ... 14 North Dakota .. 3
California ... 1 South Carolina. 6.
Kentucky 2
.... .. 7 Washington .....
Illinois .. ...... 1 Tennesse ..... 7
Louisiana ..141
One hundred and forty- two of these
lynchings occurred in the south, and
( the alledged crimes were as follows:
Race prejudice, 4; arson, 5; murder, 69;
robbery, 18; assaults, 7; attempted rape,
9; rape, 23; writing insulting letters, 1;
outlawry, 3; unknown offenses, 5; train
wrecking, 1; mistaken identity, 1; refusing
to give evidence, 1; insults, 1;
concealing a murder, 1; disobedience of
regulations, 1; running quarantine, 1.
Beyond all reasonable doubt the prevalence
of murder disclosed by these fig-
ures of the Chicago Tribune was largely
due to the carrying of concealed weapons
; and until the general assembly
takes hold of this matter in earnest
the record of Alabama each recurring
year will not be an enviable one. Life
is too cheap throughout the country,
and it is the duty of the people to take
steps to bring about a better state of
things in this state. Some wholesome
allopathic legislation will the case
elegantly. fit

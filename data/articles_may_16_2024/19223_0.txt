Southern Reign of Terror.
The list of negro murders and negro
lynchings in the south, and especially
in Georgia and Alabama, had numerous
additions. The lynching bee at Hunts-
ville, Ala., was especially notable because
in the efforts of the mob to get
at the accused negro murderer, Horace
Maples, the soldiers on guard were
overpowered and several of them were
wounded. At Brunson, Fla., the negro
Bradley, who brutally murdered Mrs.
B .. Barrett with a baby at her
N. breast, was captured and surrendered
to the mob by two negroes. Bradley
was not only hung to a tree, but his
body was found in a mutilated condition
. In the affair at Huntsville the
jail was burned down. At Selma, Ala.,
three white deputy sheriffs were ar.
rested for murder, having helped in
the lynching of the negro Edward Ball
a month ago. At the same place a negro
mail carrier W. M. Huggins, was
brutally assaulted, by two white men.

In a duel between a negro and Marshal
M. A. Davis and Lon Davis at
Hiawanee, Miss., Lon Davis was shot
in the face and the negro was killed.
Davis, who was trying to arrest the
negro on a warrant, was exonerated.
Within the past sixty days twenty-
five negroes have been lynched in dif-
parts of the United States for
ferent alleged assaults on white women.

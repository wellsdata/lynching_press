Mississippi Re-License
Lynching
Wo
HEN a jury acquitted Gold O.
Cane one of the known mob lead-
ers who lynched Lindsay Cole-
man, after the latter had been ac-
quitted by a jury, the State of Miss-
issippi re-licensed mob-law in
its
confines, very much to the disappoint-
ment of the `qutside public.

It must be borne in mind that the
one big incentive for blood-thirsty
mobs is the fact that the members |
of these mobs feel that they are im-
mune from punishment just as longi
e as their victims are Negroes. So the
S. mob spirit under these conditions,
has grown bold and bolder with the
lynching of each victim. But the
lynching at Clarksdale, Mississippi,
g December 19 last, was the boldest
and most contemptible in recent
years.
Just think of it! Coleman, the
Svietim, was taken out of the hands
1 of the high sheriff of the county, ac-
acording to the sheriff's own testimony
under oath. Not a shot fired by him
in defense of the law. He also tes-
tified that he handled and was hand-
led by members of the mob who had
t Coleman in their custody before the
lynching actually took place. His
personal acquaintance and contact
with the mob leaders precluded him
making any mistake as to the identi-
ty of the persons he handled; yet;
a jury, after listening to such a tez-
timony and that of other citizens,
arbitrarily acquitted the accused.
e
The findings by the jury, speak-
ing and acting for the State will, no
doubt; do more toward encouraging
mob violence in the state than any-
thing that has happened for many
years..
C
There is hardly a hope left that any
member of the mob will be punished
for the lynching of Coleman. No
one knows what will happen next in
the way of mob violence in the State
of Mississippi. The attorney who do-
fended Lindsay says he was also
threatened by the mob. With such
encouragement as was given in the
jury's verdict, the time is not far-
distant when it will be dangerous for
an attorney to defend a Negro in the
Bayou State.

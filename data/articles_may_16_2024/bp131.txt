Ask U. S. to Reopen
Mack Parker Lynch CaseU.
CHICAGO (ANP)-A Chicago
civil liberties organization has
called upon the U.S. Attorney
general to reopen the Mack Par-
ker lynching case. Parker, a
Negro truckdriver, was dragged
from his cell in the Poplarville,
Miss, jail and lynched in May,
1959.
A letter signed by Prof. Robert
J. Havighurst, chairman and Rev.
William T. Baird, executive dir-
ector, was sent to Robert F.
Kennedy after a unanious vote by
the board of directors.
POINTING OUT that recent
reports of the Federal Civil
Rights commission indicate that
the Department of Justic has
not officially closed the case, the
committee urged immediate pro-
secution under the Civil Rights
Act, which permits by-passing a
grand jury indictment where col-
lusion existed between local auth-
orities and the lynchers.
The letter said in part: "As a
civil liberties organization, let us
add that while the requirement of
a grand jury indictment repre-
sents under normal conditions an
important safeguard, the lack of
true representative government
in the deep South has turned this
safeguard into a cover for the per-
petrators of racist crimes which
disgrace our nation. The Mack
Parker lynching was such a
crime. The cause of human free-
dom will suffer as long as those
guilty of such barbaric acts are
not brought to justice."

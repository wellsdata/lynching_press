In Pittsburg, Pa., a few days ago
a white man married a Colored woman
and by so doing his father and
friends wanted to mob and lynch him,
evidently they are opposed to the two
races crossing, and breeding with each
other, but that is nothing new, for
the two races have for years been
breaking down the bars in this respect
and during that time many white
men have made love and kissed Col-
women and is said that fair ex-
ored change is no robbery.

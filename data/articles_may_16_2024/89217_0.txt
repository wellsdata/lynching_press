THREE NEGROES LYNCHED.
The mob which lynched Strickland
captured Albert Newell, a negro who
expressed himself to the effect that the
death of every negro should be avenged,
and put him to death. The mob is said
to be still on the hunt for negroes and
probably more will be lynched before
the work two has been finished.

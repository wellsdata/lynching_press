LYNCHING. ESCAPED A
Alleged Barn- Burner Gives a Kentucky
Mob the Slip.
Lexington, Ky., Feb. 18.- A mob of
20 masked men attacked the Wayne
county jail at Monticello at an early
hour Sunday morning The jailer was
.
overpowered, his keys taken away, the
cells unlocked and Fountain Martin
and James Troxell( white men), who
arrested several weeks
were ago
charged with burning the barn of Bonnie
Bates, were taken from the prison.
The men were carried to a point near
Steubenville, where, in a little grove,
the body of Martin was found, cold in
death, hanging from a limb. He had
no coat, hat or shoes.
Troxeil appeared at a farmhouse
three miles from the scene of the hanging
and got breakfast Sunday morning
. He said that while the mob was
hanging Martin, he made his escape in
the darkness. This was the third attempt
to lynch Troxell. Three weeks
ago he was taken from his home by a
mob and hung to a tree until he was
nearly dead, in order that he might
confess to the burning of Bates' barn
or tell who did it. He swore out warrants
the next day for a number of
prominent men in and around Steuben-
ville, but he never appeared against
them, and he was later placed in jail
with Martin, who at first been
charged with burning had the lates barn.

GREAT EXCITEMENT IN KANSAS!
Governor Robinson in the hands
of the Border Ruflians !!
More Lynch Law and more Hanging !!!
WHETHER the Governor is now to be
hung or not is uncertain, but one thing is certain
that our large stock of WALL PAPERS have not
escaped hanging, but are" pin'd to the wall," and to
meet the demands of the trade we have just received
another large and splendid assortment. Our patterns
are new and beautiful and the prices but a small advance
from call soon the while manufacturers the assortment. Those is good in want. will

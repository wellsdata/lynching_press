A GAMBLER LYNCHED.- We learn that a
gambler of the name of Williamson suffered
the penalties of Lynch law at Hickman a few
days since, at the hands of the passengers of
the steamer St. Paul. It appears that a party
of returned Californians started for St. Louis
on the boat from New Orleans, but as the boat
was about leaving port a police officer came
on board and cautioned the passengers to beware
of gamblers and pickpockets during the
trip, at the same time informing them that several
of the fraternity were on the boat. This
made the Californians extremely cautious and
wary of the approaches of their fellow
sengers. pas-

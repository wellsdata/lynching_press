The murder of the Ward Brothers
at Devil's Lake should open the eyes
of people to the danger there is in
the outcropping of mob law in any
form. It is an evil always and under
all circumstances. It is high time that
the people and the press take the
ground that to kill a man without
process of the law is to commit mur-
der, whether the victim is an innocent
man or a fend, An outraged
community may take satisfaction in
summarily hanging a brutal ravisher
or midnight assassin, not thinking
that they are weakening the force of
and order and the cause
of violence and murder. Mob law is an
enemy to public peace and safety,
and it will always be found that
those who participate in it are not
o are most
the individuals who are most concerned
for the security and well being
of the community. A year ago,
when the Minneapolis lynching
affair was creating such a sensation
in the Northwest, when nearly all
the papers were either openly approving
or lightly passing over the
deed, we uttered the same sentiments
we have here. We predicted
at the time that the example would
become contagious. A score of such
cases as the hanging of Thurber in
Grand Forks attest the correctness
of our prediction. It is high time
now that newspapers everywhere
cease to refer to a mob of lyrchers
as a" neck- tie party," and use their
influence to suppress all forms of mob
law whether to
some desperate criminal or to
cate a settler's claim to public lsnd vindi.

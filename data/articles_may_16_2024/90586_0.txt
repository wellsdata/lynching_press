because it is contrary and reprehensible to sound thinking.
As to reason number( 2), has the Negro problem enough
weight to be considered during these tumultuous times? Up to
date 2,689 Negroes have been lynched since 1899, only 19.8 per
cent were" accused" of rape. There have been three race riots
of world- wide significance within the last four months and increased
racial friction all over the country. It is reported that
over 150 people have been killed in these riots and over 700
injured; over$ 3,000,000 worth of property has been destroped.
Foreign countries have flung sarcastic remarks into the teeth of
our government- Germany, England, France, Brazil, Japan
and Mexico. Twelve million Negroes, one- twelfth of America's
population, are denied equal protection of the laws. The problem
has great weight and reason number( 2) is prima
worthless. facie

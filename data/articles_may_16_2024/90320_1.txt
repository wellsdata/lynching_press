RACE TROUBLES.
Another Outbreak Occurs Between the
White and Colored Cotton Handlers at
New Orleans.
NEW ORLEANS, May 18.- Another outbreak
between white and colored cot-
ton handlers on the levee occurred yesterday
at Gretna about 11 o'clock. Several
gangs of negro longshoremen appeared
on the Gretna wharf prepared
to load the steamship Orion with cot-
ton. For several days past there have
been indications of another clash between
the races at that point, and yesterday
small crowds of white men
gathered around the ship just as the
colored workmen arrived. The latter
insisted that their foreman, Dick
Smother, should secure them protec-
tion before they would proceed to
work. He started to cross the wharf
to telephone to the agents of the vessel
, when the whites opened fire. A
dozen or more shots were fired, and
Smothers fell with a bullet in the leg.
He contrived to crawl to the ferry
house, where he crossed over to the
city and received treatment. The
other negroes on the Orion immediately
sought places of hiding from the
mob, and their complete disappearance
from the scene prevented
bloodshed. further

The Interdenominational
union of Charleston, S. C. and vicin-
ity. in its regular meeting Monday.
June 8, resolved to send forth this
appeal for united prayer in behalf of
justice in general and mob violence
and lynching in particular.
The spirit of mob violence has cre-
ated a tragic situation in our national
life which demands the grave concern
and the most earnest attention of all
serious people. The minority group
of America, in particular, has suf-
fered no little torture throughout
the years as a result of this spirit. Just
as, apparently, the problem of lynch-
ing was getting under control, came
the revival of the lynching bee with
more flagrant daring than ever
known, a condition at which even
primitive peoples would hang their
heads in shame. The recent outrages
in Sherman and Honey Grove, Texas;
in South Carolina, and Oklahoma,
abetted by prejudicial agencies North
and South, and given unrestrained
license by the silence of the “powers
that be," tell a sad story against the
Christianity practiced in this land of
the free and home of the brave. lf
those of us who preach a loving
Christ of a corymon people fail to lift
our voices against this evil, we are
not only recreant to the trust com-
mitted to us, but by our inuteness we
both sanction and support the worst
enemy of well-ordered society, and
the sinister adversary of constituted
government.

There are men and women who
have spent years in accumulating
property and building up a home, who
find that in this year of our Lord.
1920, their labor is void and their
hope vain. Every now and again.
under the lash of mob violence, many
such persons are forced to turn their
backs on their earnings of a life time,
break with familiar environments,
and seek safety in faraway climes.
Ofttimes they reach new spheres but
to find that the venom of race hatred
has traveled on ahead. It appears
that all of their strivings are but a
vain attempt to sing the Lord's songs
in a strange land. In a time like this
the Christian church cannot afford
to be silent.
When it becomes possible for the
burned body of a human being to
dragged through the streets, taken
from under the very dome of a castle,
for equity, strung to trees, suspended
in air, riddled with bullets, while his
parched, cracked, protruding tongue
and bursting lips beg for mercy;
when men and women can sniff the
odor of hair, and blood, and human
Resh without shrinking and with jeers
and jibes on their lips: when justice
can sleep in the face of these startling
scenes accentuated by the glare of the
lynchers' pyre-then Heaven, that
always listens, is our next court of
appeal. And, thanks to all that is
high and holy, God is not dead.
This land, baptized and enriched
by the blood of our fathers, must not
continue an orgy of license and law-
lessness. Liberty must not forever
run wild, while the church of Christ
remains dumb. We cannot fight with
carnal weapons; but we are the fol-
lowers of One who prayed, and pray-
ing, won His victory. We are conti-
dent there is prevailing power in the
earnest prayers of the righteous.
There is a God who answers, and to
Him we have resolved to cry without
wearying. It lynching, and mob vio-
lence, and injustice can continue, it
must do so over the faithful. fervent.

our union was given over to prayer

in any place. Lynching is a common
foe. Injustice is an enemy of all so-
ciety. On June 22. the fourth Sun-
day, the International Ministers union
of Charleston, S. C.. representing some
fifty-five congregations with upwards
of eighteen thousand communicants,
will invite our people to unite in a
special "day of prayer." in which pe-
titions will be sent to God for His
powers against this menace to our
civilization.
We send forth this appeal that all
ministers and other leaders through-
out America, especially of our group.
and all others who care to unite, will
join with us in prayer on that day
for justice in general and against mob
violence and lynching in particular.
May we start the day with prayer.
Pray at church: pray at home: pray
at work: pray in private and in pub-
lie. May special services he given to
praye, and may the God of all earth,
the God of our fathers, the God of
the righteous, enable us to go about
this matter with such a seriousness
and unity of purpose that it shall
bring safety to all people of our com-

our firesides, and all mankind may
enjoy membership in a genuine de-
mocracy, pervaded by the spirit of
Messiah.

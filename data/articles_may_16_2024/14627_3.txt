The crime for which the three men
were lynched was committed on the
night of July 13 near Barbers June
tion, about forty miles from Greensboro.

wife and two children, were killed while
asleep, a third child was fatally wound-
ed and the house set on fire. The discovery
of the crime was made by two
elder daughters who were sleeping up

the two Gillespies, Dillingham and wife,
George Ervin and Henry Lee. The trial
of these sis, including the three lynched,
began Monday at a special term of court

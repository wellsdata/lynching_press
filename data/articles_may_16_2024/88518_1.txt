The Horror at Wilmington.
From the New York Herald.
The revolting tragedy at Wilmington
midway between the commercial metropolis
of the country and its political
capital- brings lynching pretty close
home to us. Among the thoughts suggested
by the dreadful story are:
First- The negro criminal had served
several terms for felonious
assaults
. Penalties should be cumulative
so that a repetition of such crimes
should consign the perpetrator to imprisonment
for life instead of letting
him loose like ferocious animal to
prey upon society a.

mobsters to tour the jail and see

were not there. The two men sought
were Samuel Shepherd and Walter
Irvin, both 20. They were recently
discharged from the Army and

AI.L RIDERS HOODED
A detachment of fifty National-
Guardsmen reached Groveland
Sunday night after the sheriff had
requested Governor Warren to in-
tervene in the situation. There were
about twenty cars of the riders-
all of whom were hooded-bearing
tags from Orange and Polk coun-
ties. They drove through this city
late Sunday distributing leaflets en-
titled "Ideals of the Ku Klux Klan,"
published by the Associated Klans
of Georgia.
Sheriff McCall said the evacuated
Negroes were aided in leaving town
Saturday in trucks provided by
what he described as "responsible
white citizens" when it was learned
that the mob was being formed.
The automobile cavalcade roared
into the Negro section shortly after-
wards.
ON SHOOTING SPREE
After being balked in their lynch
attempt, the mobsters drove back
to the Negro area and fired several
shots into a cafe said to belong to
one of the suspects in the case. A
man asleep in the building was
unhurt by the fusillade. Buckshot
charges were also fired into a Ne-
gro home between Groveland and
nearby Bay Lake, but no one was
at home.
The evacuated Negroes were re-
moved to surrounding towns.
Guardsmen reported the situation
was near normal early this week.

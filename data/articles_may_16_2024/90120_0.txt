TEXAN DESCRIBES
RECENT BURNING
AT STAKE OF BLACKS
INDICATES WHITE MEN, NOT NE-
GROES BURNED, WERE GUILTY
OF ASSAULT
Speaking at Thursday's meeting of
the Thirteenth Annual Conference of
the National Association for the Ad-
avancement of Colored People, in Beth-
any Baptist church, 269 Bank street,
Newark, Daniel Kelly, white Texan
from Waco told a dramatic story of
the burning to death, by a mob, of innocent
Negroes in Kirwin, Texas, on
May 7, 1922. Mr. Kelly said in part:
" Three Negroes were burned at the
stake in Kirvin, Texas, May 7, 1922,
for the alleged offense of brutally assaulting
and killing a seventeen year
old white girl, Eula Ausley. A week
later I personally investigated this
affair and found the facts to be as fol-
lews:
" Between the family of John King,
grandfather of Eula Ausley, and a
neighboring family of Prowells there
had been a bitter feud in which one
of the King boys had been maimed
and two Prowells driven from the
country.
" From the thicket where the girl's
body was found foot tracks led to the
Prowell's and the two Prowell boys
disappeared while the
posse was
hunting for the perpetrators of the
murder. After the burning of the
Negroes the Prowells were arrested
and later released when they explain-
that they had been making bran
mash in the thicket. The truth
of
their story was not investigated and
it was not ascertained whether the
bran mash was there or not. John
King said he was certain that white
men were implicated in the crime.
" Of the three Negroes burned the
sheriff said that one was innocent in
his opinion and the evidence shows
that not more than three could have
done the act although five were mobbed
to death for it.
" The sentiment of the people generally
was that an' example' had been
made, it was of small consequence
whether the Negroes were guilty or
innocent."
Mr. Kelly was sent to Texas by and
made his investigation for the National
Association for the Advancement
Colored People. of

MARYLANDLYNCHING
ISSUE SPLITS
MARYLAND
: SALISBURY, Md., Dec. 31.-A col-
ored man was lynched here about a
month ago, and today mob spirit, re-
vived after twenty years, still rules
on the Eastern Shore.
Maryland has slipped half way
into the fold of the backward states,
its people are bitterly divided against
one another, and Gov. Albert C.
Ritchie, a candidate for the Demo-
cratic Presidential nomination, is
seriously embarrassed by a local sit-
uation that may assume national im-
portance:
People Approve Act
Nobody has been punished for the
hanging and burning of Matthew Wil-
llams, colored murderer. A coroner's
jury has taken no action. The entire
Eastern Shore thoroughly approves
of the lynching.
Gov. Ritchie has said that the
members of the mob must be “appre-
hended and vigorously prosecuted"
and has instructed Attorney General i
W. Preston Lane, Jr., to assist Wis- !
consin County authorities.

Further than this, Ritchie has :: :
gone. He considers himself extend-
ing his own powers to the limit in
directing Lane and his office to take
part in the investigation. Then, aiso,
there is the danger of further alien-
ating the eastern half of his state
which votes dry and does not sub-
scribe to Ritchie's wet view.
State Widely Divided
Chesapeake Bay divides Maryland.
It might as well be the Atlantic
Ocean. The Dalmarva Peninsula is
a country to itself. When its people
speak of the outside world they in-
clude Baltimore in that category.
Salisbury, a town of 12,000, is the
metropolis of the Eastern Shore. It
is the home of Col. Amos W. W.
Woodcock, federal prohibition direc-
tor, and it once was Bishop James
Cannon's place of residence.

L
Flaming bitterness is expressed
against Baltimore and particularly
against the Baltimore Sun because
of a series of editorials
the lynching spirit.
Mencken, famous for his
writings, fanned the flames in the
Evening Sun with such linotype vit-
riol as ‘a public obscenity worthy of
cannibals," and "a natural culmina-
tion of a degenerating process that
has been in progress for years.":
A threat has been made to sum-
mon Mencken before the Coroner's
jury but the jury seems loath to
meet.
As a result the Baltimore Sun
papers have served as fuel for bon-
fires, and a retaliatory boycott on
Baltimore merchandise has been put
into effect throughout the Eastern
Shore country.

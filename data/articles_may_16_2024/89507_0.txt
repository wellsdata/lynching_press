NEGRO LYNCHED
BY GEORGIA MOB
Prisoners Held in Marietta
Spirited to Atlanta to
Avert Trouble
Cumming, Ga., September 10.- Mob
spirit, which has been at fever heat
here since threatened race trouble Sat-
urday, boiled over today when several
hundred white men stormed the local
jail and riddled Ed Collins, a negro,
with bullets. The body of the negro
was mutilated with a crowbar and then
dragged to the public square. In the
presence of a crowd of over 2000 citizens
the dead negro was strung up to
a telephone pole.
Collins was arrested today along
with three other negroes in connection
with the assault of a young white girl
here Sunday. It is alleged that he assisted
Ernest Cox, altas Daniels, the
negro who confessed to the crime, in
hiding the body. Cox was taken to
Atlanta for safe keeping.
-Sheriff Reid had difficulty in getting
the prisoners into the local jail on account
of the mob, which assembled
when the arrests were, made public.
Shortly after the negroes were inear-
cerated the mob attacked the jail with
crowbars and effected an entrance.
None of the other prisoners were molested
.
While no further trouble is anticipated
here, tonight threats of violence
are being made on all sides in the event
that Cox or the five negroes spirited
to Marfetta are brought back here
trial. for

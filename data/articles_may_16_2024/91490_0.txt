SOUTHERN A SHERIFF.
Wishing to Save the Jail, He Made No
Resistance to the Lynching.
" Speaking of lynchings," said Jen-
kins," reminds me of an incident that
occurred in one of the country parishes
of Mississippi several years ago.
I was making a trip through a certain
section of that state when the community
was startled by a peculiarly
atrocious murder and assault. The affair
took the people by the ears, and
for a few days, or until the culprit was
captured, there was a perfect storm
of fury on the part of the inhabitants.
of the county in which the murder
took place. The culprit was a negro,
and it happened that the parish officials
were the first to lay hands on
the fellow. He was conveyed, with
some show of secrecy, to the jail and
locked up. Well, it didn't take long
for the news to spread, and then the
people, as usual, began to make ready
for the lynching. They did not seem
to consider the matter that the negro
was in the hands of the county- not a
bit of it. I was curious to see how the
affair was to turn out, and some little
while before the mob started for the
jail I set out for that institution. When
I reached the location, imagine my surprise
when I found the sheriff calmly
seated on the front steps of the jail
with a rifle in his hands. Alongside
of him was the negro, with fear depicted
on his face. Both were watching
the road. Approaching the sheriff,
I asked him why he did not have the
negro locked up and if he didn't know
the mob was coming to lynch him
" Oh, yes,' he answered,' I know. the
boys are coming, and that's why I've
got the" nigger" ready. You see,' he
remarked, apologetically,' I know the
fellers are bound to have the" nigger
," and then the jail is brand new."
" While I
was pondering over this
reply the sheriff added,' And it would
be a pity to have the new doors
broken."" New Orleans Times-

Gov. Charles S. Deneen, at
Springfield, Ill., declared the office
of Sheriff of Alexander county
vacant Nov. 18, because Sheriff
Frank E. Davis allowed William
James, a Negro murderer, and
Henry Salzner, white uxorcide, to
be taken from his care and lynched
at Cairo, Ill., by a mob on the
11th. The governor acted in observance
of a law which provides
that whenever a sheriff surrenders
prisoner to a mob, his office ex-
a pires immediately.

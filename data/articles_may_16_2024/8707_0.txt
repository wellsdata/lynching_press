Figures gathered by the Treasury
Bureau of Statistics, on the movements
of internal commerce for the
first half of 1901, show the tide of
commercial prosperity is still on the
upward trend. Wheat receipts at the
eight leading markets, including Min-
neapolis, Milwaukee, Duluth, Chicago,
Kansas City, St. Louis, Toledo and
Detroit aggregate 217,159,743 bushels
for the season to June 30, 1901, compared
with 209,972,910 bushels for the
season to June 30, 1900. The yearly
receipts of live stock at five markets
to June 30, 1901, have been 2,969,566

sheep. This exceeds by 344,552 head,
the arrivals for the corresponding period
of last year. Traffic receipts of
live stock at Chicago alone were 4,208
cars above those of the first six months
of 1900, and shipments were greater
by 3,786 cars. This illustrates the increasing
extent to which transportation
interests have been sharing in
the enlarging output of staple farm
products.

WANTED TO LYNCH
HOTEL PROPRIETOR
Upper Sandusky, Ohio, Mob Tries
to Get Man Who Shot and
Killed Rival.
UPPER SANDUSKY, Ohio, Aug. 7-1
Cries of" mob him,"" lynch him," greet
prietor of the Hotel Reber, late last
evening, soon after he had shot down
and killed Frank McCormick, employe
of a rival hotel, the Gottfried, on the
Pennsylvania railroad station platform.
Extra police were sworn in and the jail
is being guarded against an attempt at
lynching, which is feared because of
feeling against Goodlove.
McCormick protested to Goodlove
when the latter took a commanding position
with his bus at the railway station
. Goodlove applied a foul name to
McCormick, it is asserted, being struck
in the jaw in response. Goodlove pulled
revolver and shot the fleeing McCor-
a mick.

Pursued by Crowd.
Noise of the shooting attracted the
attention of some persons outside, who
seeing the Russians hurriedly leaving the
bank, pursued them. The Russians fired
on their pursuers, seriously wounding two
and slightly wounding
persons two
others.
In their flight they emptied their revolvers
, and it was fortunate that many
persons were not killed.
At length the Russians were avertaken
and captured by gendarmes. They were
carrying the stolen money in special
sacks.
Each man had fifty cartridges on him.
Late last night the murderers, hand
cuffed and accompanied by three detec-
tives, were taken in separate trains to
Lausanne.
Angry crowds collected at Montreux
and Lausanne stations and tried to
lynch the murderers, attacking especially
Nilista, who killed the cashier and
wounded four other Swiss, Danieloff's
boyish appearance exciting some pity.
At Lausanne station Nilista received a
violent blow on the head from a stick,
and his face and collar were covered with
blood. He coolly asked a detective to
wipe away the blood, as his own
were handcuffed. hands

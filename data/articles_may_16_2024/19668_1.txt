Narrowly Escaped the Noose.
TOPEKA, April 12.- A mob hung about
the Saline jail all last night hoping to
lynch Hudson, the negro who ravished
Mrs. Frost and murdered her child. An assault
was made on the jail at 11 o'clock,
but it was unsuccessful. At 3 o'clock
the mob again attacked the jail and secured
the prisoner, placed a rope around
his neck and dragged him through the
streets.
When three blocks from the jail the
mob quarreled and a riot began, when
one of the guards struck L. L. Harvey
over the head with a gun, fatally injuring
him. Editor Bristow, of the Saline Re
publican, was seriously injured. Several
others were hurt. In the midst of the
fight Hudson was taken from the mob
and placed in the National hotel, where
he was closely guarded.
The dispute among the members of
the mob arose over the question of the
prisoner's innocence. Unless his innocence
is established today,
nothing can thoroughly prevent a lynching tonight.

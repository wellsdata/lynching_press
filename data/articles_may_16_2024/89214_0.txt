O. T. Conrey, of Springfield, Mo.,
sends us a copy of Springfield papers
with the full account of the lynching of
the three negroes in that city last Sat-
urday night. Mr. Conrey says he was
on the square with his wife when the
trouble started, but the women folks
were frightened so they all went home.
The negroes had been arrested charged
with assaulting a white girl and after
the mad mob hung them to the electric
light tower, the torch was applied and
their bodies consumed. Gov. Folk has
sent a company of the state militia to
Springfield with instructions to arrest
the leaders of the lynching party, and
is feared that more trouble will result
it.

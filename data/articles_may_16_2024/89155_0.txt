the verdict of acquittal was unanimous.
When court assembled this morning the
state at the suggestion of Judge Peebles,
formally nol prossed the third count of
the indictment, which charged the defendant

counts,
breaking into the jail and taking out
Johnson for the purpose of lynching him.
The argument was concluded at noon
and following a recess of three hours,
Judge Peebles began his charge. The

demonstration on the part of the other
defendants, visitors and witnesses from
Anson county, who gathered on the court
house ground and gave vent to their feelings
by wild cheering, which the court
did not think it necessary to suppress.

of the sheriff and jailor at the
prelimiary examination, Lewis was the
ring- leader of the mob which lynched
Johnson and the state will press all three
counts the indictment which include
murder. of

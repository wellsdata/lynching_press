All of us, North and South,
stand condemned before this
outrage and share with Geor-
gia's great majority of decent
and lawabiding people the hu-
miliation of this disgrace.
PHILA. INQUIRER
When "white supremacy"
is translated into license to
kill a helpless Negro, who is
entitled to his day in court,
and to mete out death to his
companions who are not even
suspected of any wrongdoing,
it is time for the people of
Georgia to take their stand
against this pernicious doc-
trine, to repudiate the false
and vicious leaders who have
helped to create this abomin-
able situation.
PHILA. RECORD
Terrorism has been revived
in Georgia. A measure of its
revival is the assertion now
from the chief of the State
Investigating Bureau that
"under conditions now in
Georgia we cannot cope with
mob violence."
If Georgia cannot deal with
lynch murder, then the Feder-
al Government must. This is
not only Georgia's problem.
It's the nation's problem-and
the nation's shame.
Let the
Congress, now
poised for vacation, push
through a Federal anti-lynch-
ing bill, before more lives are
taken.
N. Y. HERALD TRIBUNE
This is a time of tension in
race relations, particularly in
the South. Demagogues have
shouted their way into office
with inflammatory speeches
about "white supremacy," urg-
ing extra-legal coercion of in-
tending Negro voters.
crosses have burned again on
Southern hills and there have
been sporadic outbreaks of
violence This is a matter.
which concerns the people
the whole United States.

The total number of Federal employ-

administration of Rutherford B. Hayes
was about 3,500.

The federal government
must GET THAT MOB OF
KILLERS and bring them to
swift justice befitting mur-
derers. Death to the lynch-
ers!
-IN
The Negro people must be
armed and deputized
together
in large
with
numbers,
whites who will fight the
lynchers.
Gov. Arnall has the power
and the duty to ARM AND
DEPUTIZE NEGRO
CITI-
ZENS to defend themselves
against KKK killers.
We appeal to every city
and community to hold pro-
test meetings to support these
demands.
Make no mistake about it!
Fascism is arriving for the
14,000,000 American Negro
citizens.
If it is not smashed here,
it will engalf the entire na-
tion.
Lynch terror against our
Negro fellow-Americans will
be to the U. S. what the anti-
Jewish pogroms were to Ger-
many-the open door to fas-
cism.
ACT!
N. Y. TIMES
Decent white people every-
where feel a heartsick sense
of shame over this ugly event
beside a lonely side road
northeast of Atlanta. Are we
indeed the race that the gal-
lused Talmadge so recently
proclaimed "supreme" as he
promised to take steps to
"keep the Negro in his place"?
Those who preach hatred
and denial of the rights of
man in any State, North or
South-might ask what is
their responsibility when
something like this happens,
and sixty bullets loosed at
close range show the Negro
his "place" in American life.

In Defense of His Brother
This last shot, it is pointed out, was in
defense of the fallen brother, and was not
a wanton attack upon Dr. Hodges. The
circumstances leading up to the affray are
described in detail. According to this account
Charles Defata was alone when Dr.
Hodges passed. There is no effort made in
the report to obscure the fact that Charles
Defata made the first offensive overture,
but it is contended that this was not accompanied
by the use of fire arms or even
a movement to draw them. It is said,
however, that Charles Defata upbraided
Dr. Hodges in an offensive way for having
killed an animal and accompanied this by
a blow of the fist. Then it is stated that
Dr. Hodges shot at Defata. Whether or
not the shot took effect it was not possible
for the Italian authorities to learn, as the
bodies of the men after being lynched were
disfigured and disposed of. But all events
it is stated that Charles Defata was on the
ground following the shot from
Hodges' weapon. At this point, Joe Defata Dr.
made his appearance, and seeing his
brother down and a second shot about to
be fired, shot at Dr. Hodges. Then followed
the lynching of these two Italians.
Joe and Charles. The mob took
them before they had Defata been arrested.

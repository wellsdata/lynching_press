show that leniency in punishment for murder demoralizes
cummunity, and naturally leads to a
more frequent commission of that crime. In what
respect then, is the law of imprisonment demoralizing
to community? In answering this enquiry,
we shall naturally look around us and see if the
working of the law has been harmonious with
publie sentiment. We shall see if no popular outbreaks
have ensued, caused by the impotency of
the law to meet the demand of safety and public
justice. Upon enquiry we find a terrible tragedy
occurred at Janesville; a murderer was lynched
and hung by a mob, and this mob was witnessed
by the youths, and by the middle- aged, as well
as by the aged, and the mob itself was composed,
it is said, of" respectable men." What occasioned
this mob?" We are told that these" respecta-
ble men" did not consider the punishment which
the law inflicts and an adequate one for the terrible
crime that had been committed. If we enquire
again, we shall hear of another mob, and
another case of lynching in Washington county,
in this State. This too was a case of murder, but
the demands of public justice outstripped the
milder appliances of the law. We may abhor ri-
ots, we may preach against them until we are
gray, but that will not prevent them from being
enacted; and we cannot call a law a conservator
of good morals, which by its own feebleness
and incapacity to protect its inhabitants, calls out
the ultimate sovereignty of a State to administer
justice, warning and reproof. If the arguments
we have presented should show that the
community were demoralized by the present law
would it not in some degree establish the evidence
that murders would be more frequent from
the fact that demoralized would have
people
less reluctance a to committing crime.

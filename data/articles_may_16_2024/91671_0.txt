This afternoon as De Hart passed
Johnson's place he sneered and winked
derisively at him. Johnson said he
had been praying for strength to keep
from killing De Hart, but when the
latter taunted him he" saw red and
couldn't help killing him." He took
a shotgun and fired upon De Hart. The
victim dropped at the first shot and a
second load of buckshot passed over
him, hitting John Abadie, 50 feet away.
Johnson reloaded the gun just as Policeman
Hoque arrived and disarmed
him. Johnson made no resistance. A
crowd instantly gathered and rushed
toward him with cries of" lynch him,"
" get a rope," and he begged protection.

from the policeman and helped to keep

speed to a doctor's office. Three

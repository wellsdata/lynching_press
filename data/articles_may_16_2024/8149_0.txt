FIRST OF THE NEW YEAR.
Negro Taken From Officers in Mis-
sissippi and Lynched.
Brook Haven, Miss., Jan. 2.- The first
lynching of 1908 occurred here today, when
a mob in broad daylight took a negro
away from police officers and shot him.
The negro, whose name was Kan, was
accused of killing a policeman at Oak-
vale, Miss., on Tuesday night. The negro
had been arrested as a suspicious
person, but he came to Brook Haven
looking for medical treatment for a gunshot
wound in the abdomen.
The mob got him away from the police
by using a lasso, which was thrown
over the negro's neck as the officers hurried
him to jail. After the lynching a
negro who saw the body said it was that
Coot Aulman, accused of killing a
of policeman in this vicinity. Dec. 10.

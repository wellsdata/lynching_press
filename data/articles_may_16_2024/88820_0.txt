Oh Yes, that Miss Kate Neal of
Sweet Springs Mo., who eloped
with Johnson, her father's Negro
coachman, was insane(?) no doubt.
Its the only excuse to make for the
eradication of the disgrace(?). Insane
, why certainly and so was
Johnson, See! The usual method
now is to put the lady in the insane
asylum for month and lynch
Mr. Johnson. Better to put both
the" pen" for life.- Negro So-

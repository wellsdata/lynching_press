In its ruthlessly candid portrait
of a considerable area of
American life today," Trial" relates
the story of Angel Chavez.
He is a 17- year- old Mexican
lad who lives in a segregated
community in what look suspiciously
like Southern California although
it is never specficially located
. On a late spring night
when the town is feeling its bio-
logical oats, a semi- invalid town
girl is found dead at Angel's feet.
He becomes at once the central
figure in a rape- murder case
that enlivens the area front
pages.
Similarly, he becomes the
quarry of two inflamed forces.
One of these is the community's
racial bigots, a mob in a lynching
mood. The other is a Communist
lawyer who sees Angel's
case as a chance to exploit race
hatred in the party's cause.
In this desprate predicament,
the unjustly accused lad has a
single friend. This is an idealis-
tic young lawyer, played by Ford,
seeking court experience and
woefully unware of how much of
it he is to get between the local
mob's quest for a lynching victim
and the hunger
for a martyr Communists's.

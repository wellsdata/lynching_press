arrest at
attempting to
Waton street about 10 o'clock tonight.
Murphy, armed with a warrant for Mc-
Ray on a charge of burglary, approached
the negro and informed him that he
was under arrest. McRay instantly
drew a revolver and shot the officer in
the breast. He then attempted to
make his escape, but was caught by
Detective Chadwick. Murphy was
taken to the hospital where he died
within twenty minutes of the time he
received the wound.
McRay was hurried to city jail, and
less than an hour, a mob numbering at
least 1,000 men and boys had assembled
and asked the chief of police for the

to surrender the murderer. In the hope
of attracting the attention of the mob,

made a run past the jail. The ruse

jail. In a short time the mob discov-

morning the mob surrounding the
county jail began to disperse, awed by
the determined attitude of Sheriff Pot-
ter, who stationed a dozen deputies and
police in front of the jail, armed with
revolvers and rifles. They were instructed
to fire upon the mob should
any attempt to enter the jail be made.
Inside the building twenty police were
stationed. While at the present time
the mob still clamours for the negro, it
is evident that they lack a leader, and
authorities are confident that they
will the be able to prevent the lynching.

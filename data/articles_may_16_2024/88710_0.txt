After assaulting Miss Krause with a
razor, Martin was placed in a cell in the
county jail. The first intimation that
Sheriff Cook had of the contemplated
lynching was when two masked men appeared
in the kitchen of the jail house,
and with guns levelled at him, told him
that there were 200 men waiting outside
for the negro and that he had better not
attempt to make any trouble for them.
In the meantime, another masked man
had entered and while the first two held
the sheriff, the third man took the keys
of the jail from the sheriff's pocket and
then the three started for the
cell. negro's

On the way they met Dr. Miller who
had been summoned to attend the wounds
of Martin, self- inflicted with the same
razor he had assaulted the girl, and
Turnkey Jones. They were both compelled
to stand against the cages of the
cell with their faces turned from the mob.

lamp post, a short distance from the
jail, the negro was quickly strung

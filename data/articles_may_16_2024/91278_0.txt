REBEL ATROCITY IN TEXAS.
A Loyal Texan taken Prisoner- He is
turned over to the Mob and Hung.
From the New Orleans Era, March 7.
Private advices from Texas informs us of a
most infamous and inhuman crime, committed
by the rebel officers of Texas and by a mob of
citizens.
It will be remembered that the United States
transport Cumbria left this city for Galveston
just previous to the capture of the Harriet Lane,
and the disaster which drove our gunboats from
the harbor; and that when the Cumbria approached
Galveston all on board supposed the
place to be in possession of our troops, whereas,
in fact, it was in possession of the rebels. No
pilot came out to pilot in the vessel, and finally
a boat containing five men was sent ashore.
These five men were immediately seized and
imprisoned by the rebels.
One of them was" Nicaragua" Smith, who
was tried for desertion from a rebel regiment
and shot, as we have already announced in this
paper.
Another of the five was a man namel Cro
nain, a loyal Texan, who had fled from the
State and enlisted in the First Texas cavalry,
under Colonel Davis, a regiment of loyal Tex
ans organizing in this city.
Cronain had never been in the rebel service,
and could not, therefore, be tried for desertion;
and so the military authorities turned him over
to the mob, and he was hung,
The only reason that could be alleged for this
barbarous act, was the simple fact that Cronain
was a Texan, and had enlisted in the United
States service.
There is a large number of loyal Texans now
in this city, who have enlisted in the cause of
the Union, and they look to the Government to
give them the same protection it extends to the
rest of its soldiers. If we are not mistaken,
there is now at least one rebellious citizen of
Texas in prison in this city. We refer to the
individual who came out in a boat and attempted
to induce the Cumbria to follow him as a
pilot, with a view of getting her into the
of the rebels. hands

SOUTH CAROLINA has a criminal Governor. In his official capacity he

has been guilty of abetting a
arrested for assault near one of the towns in the interior of the State, and
the Sheriff having him in charge, fearing a lynching, appealed to Governor
Blease for troops to protect his prisoner. The Governor's answer was for
the Sheriff to keep in touch with the situation and let him know the conditions
the next morning. When next morning came the Sheriff reported
that the Negro had been lynched. In an address delivered shortly after,
Governor Blease said that the event was just as he expected and wished, and
that, rather than send troops, he would have resigned his office and gone
to lead the mob. This, from the head of a State government, who, as such,
has sworn to support the constitution and to execute the law, is probably
the most notorious confession of criminal complicity ever made by a high
civil officer. The remark that he would have resigned his office is wholly
boastful and superfluous. He has done greater crime as Governor than he
could ever do as the leader of a hundred mobs. There is talk of his impeachment
and that is the only thing which can make the laws of South Carolina
seem, worthy of respect.
GOVERNOR. CRIMINAL A

Mob After a Negro.
GALENA, Kan., Jan. 31.- A mob of fifty
masked men were at the Memphis depot
here early this morning, when Constable
Lafe Loe arrived from Columbus with
Richard Ward, a negro, who, without serious
provocation, fatally stabbed Dennis
Brown last week. The mob demanded that
Ward be handed over to them, but the officer
quickly drew his prisoner into the car
and started for Columbus. He had not
reached there late to night and there are
reports that the negro- had been lynched.

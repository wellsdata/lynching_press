NEW YORK. Expressions of
indignation and deep concern over
the alarming increase in lynchings
and anti-Negro "incidents" were
transformed into a militant plan
of action at a meeting, called by
Arthur B. Spingarn, of the Exe-
cutive Committee of the newly-
1
formed Commitcee
Violence.
Against Moh
Key individuals, who dominate
the social forces of the country,
will be mobilized to commit them-
selves openly against mob violence
in an attempt to curb the rising
tide of prejudice and terrorism.
National, state and county officials
with an enlightened public opinion
pressing for peaceable and consti-
tutional law enforcement methods
will, it is expected, hesitate to
ride lawlessly over the rights of
minority groups, as has been the
pattern set in some sections of the -
United States in the past few
months.
Some of the members of the
Executive Committee are Philip
Murray, President CIO; Charles G.
Bolte, Chairman, American Vete-
rans' Committee: Edward L. Ber
nays, public relations consultant;
Clyde Miller of Teachers College,
Columbia University; Max Yergan
of the National Negro Congress:
Mrs. Alfred E. Mudge of the Na-
tional Board of the Y.W.C.A.; Dr.
Allan Knight Chalmers of the
Broadway Tabernacle, and Walter
White, Executive Secretary, NAA-
CP.

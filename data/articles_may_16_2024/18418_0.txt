The trial of fourteen defendants has
been on for four days. Most of the defendants
have tried to prove alibis or to
prove that they were immocent by- stand-
ers. Sheriff Whitlock and his deputies
who defended the jail against the assault
of the mob by the use of shotguns and
revolvers, thus saving a negro prisoner
from being lynched, identified all those
convicted.
During the afternoon Richard Roberts
turned state's esidence and identified five
of the defedants as persons whom he saw
in the mob. He identified Bessie
and said that she stood on a wagon and
urged the mob to lynch Sheriff Whitlock.
There are eight other men under indictment
but they may not be tried, as
those found guilty are said to be the ring-
leaders. convicted persons are subject
to a The penitentiary sentence.

TENNESSEE EDITOR IS
CHAMPION OF CRIME
OF LYNCHING NEGROES
HUNTINGDON,
Tenn, Tenn
Hasta
oft-published figures showing that less
than one in every four lynching vic-
tims is even accused of rape, the edi-
tor of the Huntingdon Republican still
upholds the lynching mob. This edi-
tor says in a recent issue:
"Some of the high-brow journals are
decrying the lynching of the Negro at
Union City last week. The red-blooded
men who have no qualms of killing
a mad dog or a rattlesnake are not
going to lose any sleep over the deed of
the 'mob'. It is generally death for
a brute to attempt rape and should be.
'It is death to touch' should be forcibly
impressed on these lecherous animals."

IDA B. WELLS IN BROOKLYN.
S. V. White Says She Is Another Moses
Gen. Stewart L. Woodford on Lynch Law.
Miss Ida B. Wells addressed a large audience
last night in Association Hall, Brooklyn, on the
alleged negro atrocities in the South. Many
white persons were present. Gen. Stewart 1 ..
Woodford presided, and S. V. White and Col.
Alexander S. Bacon were seated on the platform.
Gen. Woodford said that they met as Ameri
cans to protest against the un- American practice
of lynch law. A reverence for law is one
thing that should characterize this republic.
The white race in this land, with all its opportunities
, is under obligation to take more care
for the lowly and in its ranks than for
itself. humble
She said that there was no sign that the lynchings
were decreasing, 206 having occurred during
the present year. Not only have they in
creased in number, but they have intensified in
their barbarism and boldness. They now occur
in broad daylight, and photographs of them are
sold as souvenirs. The burning of the victims
has now been introduced as a diversion.
The question is whether this nation is capable
of self- government. The Christian and moral
forces in this country are required to revolutionize
public sentiment. Miss Wells regarded
it as a hopeful sign that her native city of Mem
phis, from which she was driven, is at present
engaged in the prosecution of some of the per
sons engaged in recent lynchings.
S. V. White in denouncing lynch law said
that he regarded Miss Wells as a Moses who
had been raised up to start this great crusade,
and he thanked God this woman had lifted
her voice in detence of that her downtrodden race.

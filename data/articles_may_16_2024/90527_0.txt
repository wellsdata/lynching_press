Man Accused of Murder in Spring-
feld Lynching is Acquitted.
After a deliberation of three hours the
jury in Springfield tha: heard the evidence
in the case against Abraham Ray-
mer charged with murder found the de-
,,
fendant not guilty. Raymer was alleged
to be the leader of the mob that lynched

riots. Raymer also was indicted on a
number of other charges and was remand-
to jail. The other causes probably
will be disposed of in a short time. Quiet

jurors, thanking them for acquitting him
and saving his life. He insisted that he
is innocent of the charges against him.
His sister. Mrs. Albert of Boston, who
has been with him in the court room during
the long trial, also thanked the jury
. The twelve men voted Raymer not
men guilty on the first ballot.

POSSE SEARCHES
FOR LYNCHERS
Special Grand Jury Is to be Called
to Investigate the
Case.
NEWARK, Ohio, July 9.- Sheriff
Linkeim with a posse of deputies is
today searching for the ringleaders af
the mob which last night lynched Carl
Etherington, the detective' employed
by the anti- saloon league. The lynchers
were unmasked and it is thought
a number of arrests will be made
soon. A special grand jury will be
called to consider the case. Adjutant
General Weybrecht openly condemns
the sheriff, stating that" lynching in
a densely populated state like Ohio
with troops scattered over it is absolutely
inexcusable." The lynching
is the result of the attempt of the
Anti- Saloon league to show that blind
pigs exist in Licking county although
It is dry. Etherington headed a raid
on a restaurant and shot the proprietor
which incensed the people
to such an that they lynched
the detective extent.

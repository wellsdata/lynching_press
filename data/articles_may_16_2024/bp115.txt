Neighborhood Kids
Watch 'Sugar Ray'Watch
WASHINGTON
(UPI) –
The "fight mob" that hangs
around the gym where
Sugar Ray Leonard trains
can best be described as
the Sesame Street Gang.
While the Olympic gold
medal winner works out in
a corner of the room,
6-year-old Jeff and his
9-year-old brother, Greg,
solemnly shadow box in the
ring.
When he creates a blur of
motion skipping rope, Deb-
bie, 7, and Rovenia, 8,
watch in pigtailed awe
from the sidelines.
They're a few of a coterie
of admiring neighborhood
youngsters from the Wa-
shington suburban Crest-
view Heights area who
flock every afternoon after
school to the community
center where
the
20-year-old hopeful readies
himself for his second pro
bout.
They gym where Leon-
ard first took up boxing as a
15-year-old, could come
right out of an old John
Garfield movie with the
walls hung with posters of
previous fight cards in the
Baltimore-Washington area
(including Sugar Ray's
first pro bout against Luis
"Bull" Vega on Feb. 5).
But there's nothing pug-
like about Leonard. He's a
handsome youth, quick to
smile and friendly with
strangers. His face is un-
marked, his
ears
uncauliflowered.
At a trim 143-pounds, the
Olympic junior welter-
weight champion resem-
bles a tennis player more
than a fighter until he sheds
his terrycloth robe to go
three rounds with a spar-
ring partner. His shoulders
and back, his biceps bulge
with solid muscle.

"I wasn't much of a
fighter as a kid on the
school grounds," Leonard
recalls. "I just wasn't ag-
gressive. I stayed in the
house a lot. I was pretty
much on the shy side.
"I think I might have had
one fight when I was a little
older but it was mostly a
pushing match. The other
guy and I are good friends
now."
Inside the ropes for his
workout against a heavier
sparring partner, Sugar
Ray is all intent business-
man against his heavier
sparring partner.
"Get the hands up, get
the hands up," his trainer,
Dave Jacobs, instructs.
He fires a series of jabs.
"Don't reach for him, wait
till you're there," comes
the advice from Jacobs
who developed him into a
member of last year's
triumphant Olympic team.
A solid hook off a swift
jab elicits Jacobs' praise:
"That was a good one
that's real good, Ray."
There's a sheen of sweat
but no hard breathing when
the three-rounds
finished.
are
"Good work, Richard,”
Leonard tells the sparring
partner, adding a friendly
pat on the fanny. He has his
second pro bout a six-
against Willie
rounder
"Fireball" Rodriquez
coming up in Baltimore
April 2.
Chatting afterwards out-
side the whitewashed con-
crete boxing center on a
day of Spring sunshine and
puffball clouds, he says
with a laugh:
"I dream quite a bit
about my fights, sometimes
before they happen, some-
times after. But I always
win and its always unan-
imous. Maybe because in
the dream, I'm the only guy
scoring it."
The United States has
enough coal reserves to last
several hundred years.

HANGED BY A MOB.
The Sheriff Offers Resolute Resistance, but Is
Overpowered and the Prisoner Lynched.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Dec. 9.- Charles Stevens, a
desperado, known as" Omaha Charley," who
killed Herbert Kramer, at Maryville, Mo., Dec.
3, was this morning taken from jail, after a fight
with the sheriff, by a mob, who hanged him on a
railroad bridge. One of the mob was dangerously
wounded by the sheriff. Stevens was pardoned
out of the penitentiary, for a previous
murder, last winter. The particulars of the
affair are to the effect that sixty masked men
went to the jail at 2 o'clock this morning, called
up Sheriff Anderson and demanded that he
deliver Stevens to them. This he refused to do,
and told the crowd he would fight to the last in
defense of his prisoner. A committee of three
was then sent to consult with the sheriff, but
his reply was the same as before. The mob
then made a rush for the door of the jail, and,
notwithstanding the sheriff repeatedly fired into
the crowd, dangerously wounding one of them,
they forced an entrance, overpowered the sheriff,
seized the murderer and marched him, under
of a score of revolvers. to a railroad bridge,
a cover half mile away, where they hanged him.

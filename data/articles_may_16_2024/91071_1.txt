This special message is sent to Congress
by the President during the same
week that announcement is made of
the lynching of 69 men and women in
the South during the year, 1915. Not
a word of protest issues from the White
House in condemnation of this terrible
lawlessness. A special message from
the President would center attention
upon this deplorable practice and if
the President could see his way clear
that" indemnities" were paid the vie-
tims of lynch law in this country, the
practice would cease
An Infallible Means. to Secure Justice.

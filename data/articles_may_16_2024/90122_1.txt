REPUBLICAN PARTY
ABOUT TO FALL DOWN
ON ITS PROMISES
( Special to The Tribune)
BALTIMORE, Md., Aug 18- In commenting
on what has been accomplished
by the Harding administration the
Balitomre Afro- American in a pointed
editorial under the caption of" Making
a Mess of It," takes issue with the
New York World:
" The New York World remarks that
President Harding and the Republican
congress have made a mess of everything
.
" This is not altogether true.
" One thing, however, the Harding
administration is making a mess of the
Dyer Anti- Lynching Bill. Sixty- four
lynchings last year, is the record of the
mob's toll. A president and a congress
pledged to pass anti- lynching legislation
, hems and haws on the issue as
if no such pledge existed. The house
passed the bill and the senate pigeonholed
it from January, 1922, to date.
" The passage of the Dyer bill is up
to the Republican party. It has made
its pledge. So far as the Afro- Ameri-
can is concerned. No Republican candidate
for national office need expect
support until the party carries out its
pledge put anti- lynching legislation
on the to statute books.

LYNCH SUFFRAGETTE
MOB ATTEMPTS TO
ing through the streets of Perth yesterday
.
The woman, who was identified as
Rhoda Fleming from Glasgow, seized
the handle of the door of the royal
automobile before the astonished
police could act. Two policemen
then seized her and it required a
score of mounted soldiers to hold at
bay the angry mob bent on lynching
her. Miss Fleming turned out
to be armed only with a petition
against the forcible feeding of imprisoned
suffragettes. A large force
of troops was requisitioned to protect
her from the populace she
was conveyed to the police station as.

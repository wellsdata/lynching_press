SAN FRANCISCO.- As has been repeatedly
said- California is, past any
doubt, a great and growing place. A
paper published in San Francisco,
gives some interesting statistical intelligence
, in reference to outrages committed
there, within the past nine
months. In that time forty- six per
sons have been hung by the mob,
only. Six by the Sheriff, and four
hundred and eighty- nine, have been
killed in duels, and street fights.
It is a pretty well established by
lex talionis, that where a man's house
is torn down over his head, by the
mob, of a town or city, that the public
treasury suffers, in way of indemnity
; why not when the mob hangs
a man, should not the heirs and executors
receive his value to them, ined
money? It is a poor rule indeed,
that will not work both ways, and
were it established in California as
well as elsewhere, human life, would
then be held at greater value, than
now is. it

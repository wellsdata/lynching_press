Now, so far as we are concerned, we have not
" incessantly dinned it into" the public ear" that
such and such a person ought to be lynched,
hanged,"& c. We have made no remark of this
kind but once, and that was forced from us
in a moment of excitement by the incessant
calls from the State Journal, the Richmond Enquirer
, the correspondents of those papers, and others
, for lynch law against us. We warned them of
the consequences of laying violent hands on us, and
there we stopped; and on the other hand, for months
and months, we inculcated submission to law under
all circumstances, and implored the people in no
event to take the law into their own hands. Yet
the Observer gives us no credit for this, but classes
us with the newspapers" which were first to sug
mob- law, and whose course and counsels led to
the gest mobbing of our office.

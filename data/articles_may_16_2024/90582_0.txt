NIP NEGRO LYNCHING IN BUD.
Prompt Action by Gov. Deneen Probably
Saves Lives of Three Men.
A mob of 300 men, bent on lynching
three negroes who Saturday night
murdered Allen Clark, a rural mail
carrier, on a train between Vienna
and Burnside, was frustrated in its
attempt by the prompt action of Governor
Deneen. Sheriff John P. Mathis,
who had the men in custody in the
city jail, learned of the gathering of
the mob at Eldorado and Harrisburg,
and immediately wired the Governor
for assistance. The Governor at once
ordered Captains Satterfield of Mount
Vernon, Cody of Paris and Swain of
Danville, with their respective companies
of the Fourth Infantry, Illinois
National Guard, to report to Sheriff
Mathis for duty. All instructions from
the Governor were marked" at once."
The three negroes, Hosea Tahorn,
Harry Tahorn and Alexander Jenkins,
are alleged to have been drinking with
Clark on Friday and Saturday in the
vicinity of Burnside and that a quarrel
arose on the train to Vienna over
a trivial matter. The negroes are said
to have assaulted Clark and in the
melee which followed the white
was shot. man

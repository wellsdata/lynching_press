1890
A. T. Rogers, a former citizen of Idaville, was
murdered in Topeka, Kas., last Tuesday night
by a burglar. Rogers' wife was also badly
wounded. It seems that the burglar entered
the Rogers residence and a conflict ensued, in
which Rogers received two balls from the robber's
pistol. His wife came to his rescue and
was also dangerously injured. The servant girl
also took a hand and the thief was badly belabored
and his revolver taken from him. The
citizens were aroused, pursued and caught the
murderer and lynched him to a lamppost.
Rogers died Wednesday morning and his
is in a critical condition. wife

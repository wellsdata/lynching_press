The Boston Rescue.
We give to- day every thing which we can
glean of the disgraceful affair in Boston, touch-
ing the rescue of a fugitive slave from the civil
authority, by a mob of blacks and abolitionists.
We trust that Boston and old Massachusetts
will yet wipe off this stain of insubordination
to the laws of the constituted authorities. Nor
will
we ever give intelligent law abiding
up-,
,
and as we believe, patriotic Massachusetts, until
she places herself, by her own act, out of the
pale of hope. If such scenes, however, are to
occur and be repeated, we will not then regret
this; as yet, isolated case. We think the scene
is properly laid in Boston -- and the country may
as well know what is to be the action of the
North, at once, as in future. If the crisis is to
occur, the sooner the better. If the federal government
cannot, or will not enforce the laws of
the United States, in a resisting State, let the
people know it. Evils are not to be remedied
by being staved off and barely postponed- and
if such as the Boston outrage are to visit the
country, we do not wish to see them shunned
or evaded, but met at once. The country is per-
well
haps as prepared for such
events now as
,
it ever will be. If abolition fanaticism is to
array itself against the federal government, let
it take its stand in its own strong hold- and let
Massachusetts, the mother and leader of New
England have, either the honor of its overthrow,
or the responsibility, of the treason.

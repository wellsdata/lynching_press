Up to Governor Jelks.
The lawyers of Gadsden have met
and passed resolutions condemning the
murder of a prisoner practically held
in the county jail as a witness- a prisoner
that a grand jury had practically
said was an innocent man. Mr. Jelks
has also said that he was ashamed of
the action of the mob. But mere expressions
and resolutions will accomplish
nothing. The mob spirit cannot
be put down by paper pellets. Action
needed, and that, too, of the most
is vigorous sort.
Will it be forthcoming? If the answer
can be read in Limestone, where
the sheriff of that county and the solicitor
of that circuit were permitted
to go along without bringing to trial a
single man connected with the butchery
in Elkmont? Will what was permitted
in Limestone be permitted in
Etowah? There was little difference
between the two. In Elkmont a crap
game quarrel was ended in a butchery,
in Etowah an innocent prisoner was
hung, and no effort was made to avert
the disgrace to the state.
Judge Bilbro's pointed remarks, and
the resolutions of the bar call for a
trial of the sheriff who was present
when Richardson was taken out of
jail." The law," said Judge Bilbro,
" requires the sheriff to protect prisoners
even up to the point of giving his
own life to do so." It is plain he did
not do that. It seems also plain that
an innocent prisoner was taken out by
a mob and hung.
Upon the action of Governor Jelks
will turn the story of the year in the
respect of lynching. Elkmont led up
to Gadsden, and Gadsden will lead on
to similar crimes in all parts of the
state unless action, in addition to
resolution, brought into play against
the mob spirit is.

Clovis, N. M., April 27- The
brother of the young colored girl
who was lynched by a mob of white
ruffians near Wagner, Okla, a few
weeks ago, passed through this
town on his way to Mexico. He
gave a pathetic account of the
lynching to colored citizens here.
The young man's sister was but
17 years old and of respectable
parents. Two half- drunken
white walked into their
men
home during the absence of the
mother and found the girl dressing
locked themselves in her room
and criminally assaulted her. Her
screams for help were heard by her
brother, who, kicking down the
door, went to her rescue. In defending
his sister one of the brutes
was killed and the other escaped.
Later in the evening the local authorities
, failing to find the brother
, arrested the sister, who was
taken from jail by a mob at 4
Lio'clock in the morning and lynched
. From his hiding place the
brother, who is 21 years old, could
hear his sister's cries for help, but
he was powerless to aid her. The
man is anxious to learn the
Repub.young fate of his parents.

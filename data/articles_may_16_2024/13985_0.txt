DR. SCOTT REPLIES TO
DEAN MILLER ON GOP JOB
-
( Continued from Pase One)
if argument be needed.
It is not necessary for me to
characterize the failures of the
New Deal administration insofar
as they relate to our colored
population. I certainly can use
no stronger words than those
of a leading newspaper, The
Pittsburgh Courier, which sup
ported the New Deal in the '32
and 1936 elections. Apparently
in deep disappointment and dis
gust, Te Courer sad:
The New Deal has done little
to end color discrimination but
a great deal to prolong it. Be
ginning with the NRA it bowed
to the will of the reactionary
South both inside and outside the
South. It had a wonderful opportunity
to show America how
the Negro ought to be treated,
but it lost this opportunity
through cowardice and political
opportunism. Most Americans
would have approved a Square
' Deal Policy, but instead the
Southern tail wagged the Democratic
dog." For the Negro, the
New Deal has been the Old
Deal in new clothes. With power
almost as great as those of Hit
ler, Stalin and Mussolini, the De-
has
mocratic administration
wnked at discrimination Is NRA,
FHA, PWA, CCC, WPa and a
dozen other alphabetical set- ups.
Worse, it has helped spread
Jim- crowism over the
where it had never before country exist-
ed, and Negro New Deal office
holders have approved of it by
silnce or hollow apology.
" Washington, D. C., is as Jim
Crow as ever, if not more so,
but no single word of criticism
- has come from Mr. Roosevelt.
He has expressed shock over the
beating of Jews abroad, but not
.
over lynching of Negroes at
home. Mr. Roosevelt could have
at least deplored the fact tha
Negroes are pariahs in the shad
- ow of the White House, but he
preferred to make speeches con-
- demning the dictators for doing
the same thing to Jews, Caho
lics and others abroad.
" The presidest embarked en-
enthusiastically upon an intra-
party political campaign against
Democrats refusing to endorse
his New Deal politics, but evidently
approves of Senators and
Congressmen who endorse the
101d Deal of Negro prosecution
He has yet to voice any critic-
ism of flagrant discrimination
n relief and other New Deal set-
ups.
" The President has a wonderful
opportunity to teach
America an object lesson in fair
play toward a loyal minority. If
this was impractical in the
North, East and West he could
at least have said something. He
chose to remain silent although
supplied with documentary evi-
- dence of color discrimination
in almost every Now Deal setup
."
Mr. C. W. Rice, Editor of the
Negro Labor News, and Presi-
dent and Manager of the Texas
Negro Business and Laboring
Men's Association, has returned
to his home after making a
study of Negro labor conditions
in practically all o the Southern
states, and many of the Northern
and in Eastern
states. A
summary of his findings follow:
" That Negroe, both in the
North and in the South are dis-
appointed with the New Deal.
Economic and labor conditions
are worse, fundamentally, than

ions out of work, and evicted
them from their cabins in the

privation and starvation, for

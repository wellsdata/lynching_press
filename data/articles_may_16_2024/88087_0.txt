swear the truth.
CALIFORNIA,
a state whose
population came principally from
the north, has" out- Heroded
Herod" on the lynching question
. Five
men were recently
taken from the officers at Lookout
, Modore county, in that
State, by a mob and hanged for
the offense of stealing a few
pieces of barbed wire, a pitchfork
or two and some other
trifles. This is carrying the joke
entirely too far. A man's life
should be prized higher than the
value of a few scraps of rusty
iron, even though the steel trust
has the country in its embrace.
California should redeem its rep-
utation by hanging every participant
in mob, and the
hangings should this be legal ones.

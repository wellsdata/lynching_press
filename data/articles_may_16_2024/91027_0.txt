Negro Saves White Man.
Newport News, Va.- The attempt
here of a mob of negroes to lynch Isa-
dor Cohen, white, after his automobile
had run over a negro child, was
frustrated by R. H. Green, a negro
preacher, who fought off the white
man's assailants long enough to let
him escape. Cohen is held without
bond, while the child, a girl, whose
skull was fractured, cannot recover,
hospital officials say. Ill- feeling has
existed among the negroes of the city
since three of them were killed in
fight with police. a

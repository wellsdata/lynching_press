CHILD ASSAULTED A
Human Fiend Is Nearly Lynched by
an Enraged Crowd.
FALLS CITY, Nebr., Aug. 22.- A man
known as" Shorty" Wilson, a comparative
stranger, committed an assault this
evening on the seven- year- old daughter
of A. W. Burchard, a prominent merchant
of this city. The assailant gagged his
victim with a corncob. The child gave
the alarm and Wilson was found in a saloon
, where he was arrested. On the way
to the jail a crowd, headed by the child's
father, got after Wilson with a rope, and
it was with the utmost difficulty that the
Sheriff got his man behind the bars. The
crowd still hanging around the jail and
a lynching is is not improbable.

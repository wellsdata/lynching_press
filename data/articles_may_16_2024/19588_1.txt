MASKED men broke into the Gretna
jail, near New Orleans, and took out
Jim Hawkins- a negro who had been
confined on a charge of assault and
battery on a little white boy- gave
him a brief time to pray and then
hanged him. The cause of the lynching
was his generally bad reputation
the people having a dread of him.,

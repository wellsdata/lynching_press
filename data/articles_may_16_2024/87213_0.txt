Wronged Husband's Revenge.
FLEMINGSBURG, Ky., Aug. 4.- At
Sherburne, about twelve miles from
here, Bill McKee shot and killed Jerry
Roby. Roby seems to have been too
intimate with McKee's wife. McKee
fired two shots, one took effect in the
left eye and the other in his right

officers and a posse of citizens are
scouring the country for him. If he is
captured there will probably be
lynching. All are colored. a

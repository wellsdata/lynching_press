of the constitution.
We continue to deplore and condemn
the lynching of human beings. This mob
murder is anarchy and barbarism, an exhibition
and publication of the weakness
of government and of the brutality of the
people. The false excuse of assault upon
white women brazenly asserted in an off-
cial message by ex- President Theodore
Roosevelt has been exploded, especially
by the shameless lynching of colored women
. All the boasted humanitarian inter-
esta of the American people seem impotent
to stop even the burning alive of hu-
the
courts
notorious in
man State
to punish lynchers, as is
Coatesville shame here in Pennsylvania.
Lynching has become a national menace
and scandal, requiring national treatment.
We demand that congress make lynching
a federal crime under the sole jurisdiction
of the federal courts, with right
to a change of venue. Nothing is more
eruel or productive of discontent and
crime than the denial of industrial opportunity
because of color, so flagrantly prevalent
in this land. Especially inconsistent
is exclusion for race and color from membership
of labor unions, which claim the
right to monopolize employment. We demand
state and federal laws
the same. prohibiting

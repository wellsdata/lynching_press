LEECHBURG, Pa., Feb. 21.- The town
was thrown into most intense excitement
this evening by an attempted
bank robbery and the murder of a
prominent citizen in attempting to capture
the burglars. One of the men was
captured and narrowly escaped lynching
. Some boys saw five men trying to
force an entrance into one of the back
windows of the Leechburg bank building
. They gave the alarm to Constable
Collars, S. S. McCullough and Councilman
William Schaefer. The three men
hurried to the building. Just as they
arrived one of the burglars came out and
was ordered to surrender. The burglar
drew a revolver and fired. Schaefer fell
dead, shot through the heart. McCul-
dough returned the fire, and while
the shooting was going on, great
number of people collected. The man
who shot Councilman Schaefer was
caught and hurried to the lockup. At
least 100 citizens formed themselves into
a posse and started after the other men.
The murderer was locked up and the
prison surrounded by a crowd of armed
men. Threats of lynching were freely
indulged in, but the cooler heads prevailed
. But little can be learned about
the gang that did the business. It is
certain the second burglar was wounded
and the chances of his capture are
good as the whole town is scouring the
country, for him.

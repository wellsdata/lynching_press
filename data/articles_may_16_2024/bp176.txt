TOO BUSY TO TALK'
But Dr. E. L. Biles, Mayor of
Sumner, said this was not from
fear it's because they are busy.
"I personally have been too busy
delivering babies and haven't even
had a chance to get over to the
post office," Biles said.
"Cottonpicking is just getting un-
derway and most everybody else
is busy in the fields. Even the ar-
raignment didn't create too much
excitement among white or Negro
residents."
SANE INTEREST
He added, however, "some of the
residents have a passing interest in
the case and want to see justice

Biles charged that Sumner is “the

In the case. Bryant and Milam are
from Money, and the boy abducted
from there. However, his body was
found in the Tallahatchie River near
Sumner.
"The Delta is unusually quiet,"
said Biles. "We don't expect trou-
ble, and I don't think we'll need any
National Guardsmen. Things like
this happen every day in Chicago.

SUMNER, Miss.
(SNS) The possibility arose Wednesday
that two Mississippi white men, charged with the lynch-murder
of a 14-year-old Negro boy, Emmett Louis Till from Chicago,
might be tried within the next three weeks. It had been previously
stated that the pair, Roy Bryant and his half brother, J. W. Milan,
would not be tried before early next year,

Circuit Judge Curtis Swango, Jr.
stated that he would set the trial
date today. According to Sheriff H.
C. Strider, the trial will be set for
this term of court. The term began
Monday and will last for three
weeks.

sippi.

INDICTED TUESDAY
The two men were indicted Tues-
day for murder by an all-white
grand jury. Both entered pleas of
innocent. Because of the possibility
of a trial in the near future, bond
was not set for the pair.
Mississippi law calls for a sentence
of death in the event the two men
are convicted without recommenda-
tion of mercy; if mercy is recom-
mended, the penalty called for is
life imprisonment.
In Chicago, the dead youth's aunt,
Mrs. Elizabeth Wright, again raised
the question of the number of men
who abducted the youth from the
home and the number now under
arrest. The witnesses at the abduc-
tion, including Mrs. Wright, main-
tain that there were three men who
came to the house early Sunday
morning demanding "that boy, from
Chicago."
'ONLY TWO' SAYS SHERIFF
However, Sheriff George Smith,
who was not present at the abduc-
tion, said that he was convinced
that threre were only two men in-
volved. Sheriff Strider has stated,

body by the victim's own mother

all that the body recovered from
the Tallahatchie River was that of
the missing youth.
Also missing from the scene is
the wife of Roy Bryant

woman who allegedly was the cause
of the whole incident. It was she
who reportedly was "wolf-whistled"
at by Young Till and also she who.
according to witnesses identified
him as the "right one" when the
two (or three) men went to the
farm home to take the 14-year-old
boy.
Also in Chicago, an unidentified
"NAACP Lawyer" stated that he
would definitely file a $100,000 dam-
age suit against Bryant and Milam
if the men escape "death in the gas
chamber."
Meanwhile, the little town of
Sumner total population 650
went about its business as though
nothing had happened.

APPEAL DISMISSED.
A Louisiana Mob Took Early Action
On It.
Rayville, La., July 10.- Aroused by
the fact that an appeal to the supreme
court had been taken following his
condemnation to death on Friday on
the charge of having murdered Marshal
Chenault, a mob battered the
doors of the jail down, dragging J. D.
Freeman, white, from a cell and hanged
him.
" This is the outcome of the appeal,"
a note pinned to the dead man's
read clothing.

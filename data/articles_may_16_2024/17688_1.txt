a Third Girl.
( By the Associated Press.)
Leavenworth, Kansas, aJn. 16.- Chief
of Police Cranston, when asked today it
any effort would be made to arrest any
one, said:
" No, I think not. I know of no movement
to arrest anyone. I do not approve
of the burning of Alexander, but
he should have been hung. He outraged
another girl aside from Miss Forbes on
Labor Day, but nothing was known of it
until lately. This girl was taken to the
penitentiary yesterday and identified
Alexander as her assailant. It is
opinion that he murdered Miss Forbes my."

Fifteen persons today surrounded the
house of Sam Padgett, a negro, whom
they suspected of harboring a negro
who had criminally assaulted Mrs.
Moore, and demanded to be allowed to
search the house. Permission was
given, but when within thirty feet of
the house, those inside the building
opened fire on the posse, instantly killing
John Hare and seriously wounding
Barlow Pearson, James Daniel and Dr.
J. L. Kennedy. The posse then returned
the fire, killing Padgett and one
of his daughters, and wounding two
other girls, aged six and thirteen, and
two of Padgett's sons, twenty and
twenty- two.

and by 10 o'clock 500 armed men were
on the scene and started in pursuit of
the negroes who had escaped. One of
them was captured and taken before

him. The negro, however, was identified
as the man who shot Hare and he
was started for the Reidsville jail, together

Rosenwald Chief Lauds America As
Best Bet For Democracy Of FutureLauds
Democracy
'no.' We do not yet give full liberty
and equal opportunity to all the
people. We do not even give all
citizens the basic political rights of
the vote and equality before the
law. But we have been steadily
growing toward democracy. And I
say in a full voice that with all
her fault and failures America is
the brightest hope for decency in
human relations, for opportunity
and the pursuit of happiness by
all the people."
He proclaimed that, slowly and
steadily, American ideals have won
over prejudices so much so that we
actually have religious freedom
now, and respect labor and give
some protection to workers. In free-
ing the slaves, he declared that a
share in American opportunities
was given to these freed men.
However, with the sudden plung-
ing of this nation into war, those
gains which have been made are not
periled. The struggle against the
armies of Germany and Japan is a
struggle for the existence of de-
mocracy and anyone who gives aid
or comfort to hate and discrimina-
tion is a traitor, said the fund presi-
dent.
Contrasting outbreaks of hostili-
ties, Embree called attention to the
nation's shocked attitude when
Pearl Harbor was bomber, but de-
clared that when, on January 25, a
mob lynched a helpless Negro in
Sikeston, Mo., this attack went al-
most unnoticed.
"In many sections of the country,
agencies still exist for the very
purpose of stirring up hate of Jews
and other groups.
These anti-
American cells even use as part of
their name the word 'Christian'-in
ironic defiance of the fact that the
very heart of Christianity is broth-
erly love and the Golden Rule," he
said. "As patriots we must resist
these attacks and press onward
toward democracy."
Embree cited a three point pro-
gram which would lead toward the
preservation of democracy. These
points were employment, national
strength and unity, and the getting
to know our fellow Americans.
In employment, he stated that the
President has set the standard by
an official order banning discrimi-
nation in any industry
holding a
defense contract and in labor
unions. For national strength and
unity, all public services for dis-
advantaged groups should be en-
larged and improved.
He also advocated that an imme-
diate measure that requires atten-
tion is the equalization of salaries
of Negro teachers to that of the
American standard, and the
strengthening of health and recre-
ational facilities for all people.
Lastly, he proposed that advan-
tage of the emergency should be
taken to get to know fellow Ameri-
cans of every group, and it will
become natural at patriotic meet-
ings to include Negroes as well a»ô
whites.
"And we can show courtesy to
all our fellow men. Negroes especi-
ally have a right to expect from
others the same good manners that
they so handsomely show in all
their human relations."

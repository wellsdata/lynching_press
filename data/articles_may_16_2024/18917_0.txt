Judge Lynch Failed This Time.
DENISON, TEX., May 21.- William House, the
negro so roughly handled Monday night by a
mob, was saved by the timely interference of
Samuel Hanna, the father of one of the young
ladies attacked. Last night he was removed
from jail and carried to Sherman by a sheriff's
posse. A mob had gathered to lynch the
negro, and was marching on the fall at the
time the removal was effected. The Misses Gilbert
and Hanna were doing well last night
and are out of danger.,

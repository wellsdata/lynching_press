CHARLESTON, S. C., Sept. 22.- A
special to the News and Courier from

breth was lynched today at Edgefield
Court House. He was charged with
killing William Hammond, a young
man who was guarding the house of
Mrs. Culbreth, from whom her husband
was separated. He was taken by a
mob from his lawyer's office while he
was waiting to get bail and was carried
out of town and shot several
times, and left for dead. He revived,
walked into town, made a statement
implicating several and died.
He denied his guilt to lynchers the last.

AT Miles City, Iowa, recently a mob took
a man named Rigney from the jail and
hanged him. He was a bar- tender in the
saloon of the Cosmopolitan Theatre, and a
hard citizen. Two hours afterward the
theatre burst into flames and was completely
destroyed with six other buildings,
among which was a large drug store. Loss,
$ 50,000. It was supposed to be the work of
an incendiary in retaliation for the
of Rigney hanging

Fear Further Lynchings.
Washington, April- Until the fed-
cral government is given 5 power to
punish persons making disloyal utterances
, department of justice officials
fear more lynchings such as that
of Robert P. Prager at Collinsville,
night. This first
111., last was the
report reaching here of such extreme
violence to a German although off-
cials have feared such occurrences.
The government has no authority
to take action against the lynchers.
Officials of the department of justice
expressed the hope that state or local
authorities would speedily punish the
lynchers.
At the same it was pointed out that
until congress passes a pending bill
making it an offense to speak or
write obviously disloyal criticisms of
the United States in the war, the
government cannot punish these attacks
and reduce the danger of mob
violence.
Attorney General Gregory took to
the cabinet meeting today a report
of the lynching of a German, Rob-
ert P. Prager, at Collinsville, Ills.,
last night for discussion with President
Wilson. The government is expected
to denounce the mob's lawless
act, and express the hope there will
not be repetitions elsewhere.
A. brief note of the lynching
reached the attorney general today
from U. S. Attorney Charles Parch.
Further details were asked.
Officials made plain they deplored
the incident, both because of the effect
in this country and because it is
feared reprisals niay be made in Ger-
Americans
many on.

BABIES BORN OUT of
WEDLOCK
We were reading a report. recent
ly about 6,056 bables born out of
wedlock last year in
Georgin 793
were born in Atlanta. In 1945 the
records show that some 95,000 such
births in the United States. Almost
50,000 of the babies were born te
high school girls. This number has
increased since the end of the war.
The State Department of Vi-
tal Statistics here in Georgia
teels reasonably sure that
large number of illegitimate
births are covered up, especial-
ly by white people. The inajor-
âˆ™ity of this state's illegitimate
births are among Negroes. That
is, as far as the record is con-
cerned. When you don't
report a child born out of wed
lock for the record, there is no
way. to tell how many
were
born.
Perhaps some children are
destroyed by various means he-
fore birth. Others no doubt are
born and given away to save
the mother's name socially. Of
the 6,056 reported lust year,
5,312 of the babies born out of
wedlock were by Negro moth-
ers. That's a sad picture for
Negroes. No race can
ever be
much, and you may not like
this, unless its children are
born in wedlock. We are mind-
ful of the fact that some of
our greatest Negro leaders have
never known who their fathers
were, but on the other hand
it would have been better if
the mother would have been
able to tell who the father
was.

should be encouraged to marry
early, especially if they are be-

age out of wedlock. Old men
should be punished for ruining
young girls.. Mothers should do
a better job teaching their girls.
They should teach them in such
a way that rape would be the

father.

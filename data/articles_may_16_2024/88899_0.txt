expense of mob and lynched last Monday.
nearly$ 63,000 The lynching of Frank an atroci
total cost for ous crime, a shame and is disgrace.
What are courts of justice for if
they are to be thus violently set
aside by passionate mobs? The men
who lynched Frank are murderers,
both, in the eye of the law and of a
healthy public opinion, and they
ought to be adequately punished for
their dastardly crime. It was a double
crime, assassination and defiance
of the law of the land. The same men,
if subjected to robbery, murderous
assault or the invasion
of any of
their rights as citizens would appeal
to the courts for protection and redress
- the same machinery of justice
which they have flagrantly defiled
and condemned by their unlawful
in this case. act

by the jury was Loy Harrison,
prosperous middle-aged white
farmer and wholesale
dealer,
whose report to Walton County
Sheriff, E. S. Gordon set off the
Justice Department probe.
The Justice Department hopes
to obtain one or more indict-
ments in the case, but must first
establish the fact that one or
more state officers "intention-
ally and knowingly" deprived at
least one of the victims of his
civil rights. The murder charges
are in themselves state matters,
and action on them would logi-
|cally follow.
Jury Hearings Begun
In Georgia Lynching
SPECIAL TO JOURNAL & GUIDE TO JOURNAL& GUIDE
ATHENS, Ga.-A Federal grand jury hearing into the
shotgun lynching of two colored men and their wives near Mon-
roe last July 25 was begun here Monday, Dec. 2 as the result of
a four-month investigation conducted by the Department of
Justice. The evidence unearthed by the FBI probe was submitted
by the government at the initial hearings, and a gallery of wit-
nesses brought to the stand..
Charging the grand jury U.||
S. District Judge P. Hoyt Davis
said "there still might be viola-
tion of certain U. S. criminal
statutes, even if a major viola-
tion falls within the jurisdic-
tion of the state courts...
"If this grand jury should
discover that there has been vi-
olation of the law," Judge Davis
added, â€œand that the type of of-
fense does not fall within juris-
diction of the federal court,
then as a matter of comity the
grand jury would be well with-
in bounds of propriety in fur-
nishing evidence to state offic-
lals."

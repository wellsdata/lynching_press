the Beds and their Murdered in Couple An Old
Murderer Lynched.
Allentown, Pa., Dec, 28.- Jacob Gogel and wife'
residing four miles from Bethlehem, were found
dead in bed yesterday morning with their heads
nearly severed from their bodies. A bloody ax
was found in the apartment and the walls was
smeared with blood. Joseph Snyder, who boarded
with Gogel was believed to be the murderer.
Joseph Snyder, aged 24, the murderer, was
found in a neighboring barn under the straw this
morning at 9 o'clock. He was immediately taken
back to the house of his victims and questioned
as to the murder. He was cool and collected. He
was interrogated by Rev. Brendle, and at once
confessed having committed the crime, telling
the story with great deliberation. He was in love
with the oldest daughter of the Gogels, aged 16,
but was opposed by her parents. He believed by
killing them all opposition would be removed to
his suit. He had scarcely confessed before a
rope, taken from one of the beds, was placed
around his neck and he was dragged outside the
house and hung to a large Chestnut tree. After
being suspended 20 minutes the body was cut
down by the poorhouse authorities and taken to
that institution, where it was found death was
caused by strangulation. The officers of the law
made a vain endeavor to restrain the fury of the
mob, Detective Yoke, of Bethlehem, firing at one
of the ring- leaders without effect. Several thou.
sand visited the scene of the tragedy
during people the day.

MOB NEARLY LYNCH
NEGRO FOR ROBBERY
Mrs. A. Vertonna is in a nervous
condition, following an attempted
robbery at the hands of Robert John-
son, negro, at Phoenix Sunday night,
in which she was struck by the robber
and knocked to the ground before
she could be rescued.
The fact that the attempted robbery
occurred in a well traveled section,
where rescue was prompt, prevented
possible serious injury to Mrs. Zer-
tonna and nearly resulted in the
lynching of the assailant, when an infuriated
mob surrounded police officers
who had effected the negro's capture
. The affair took place just
across the street from the Central
station. fire

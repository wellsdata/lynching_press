THE BESSEMER BAR
OFFERS CRITICISM
Condemns Last Sunday's
Trouble and Alleged Subsequent
Events
Bessemer, January 81 .-( Special) .- At the
special meeting of the Bessemer Bar association
held in the court room today
the members declared that the lynching
Sunday was outlawry not to be tolerated
by the citizens of Bessemer, and the association
went on record to this effect in
a strong resolution passed by unanimous
vote. The changing of the name of the
magistrate to whom the warrant against
Gagliano was made returnable and the action
taken in the coroner's inquest was
also condemned. Following is the resolution
:
" We, your committee, beg leave to report
as follows: We offer and move the
adoption of the following resolution:
" Whereas, there having been committed
a lynching of John Chandler, colored, on
one of the most conspicuous thoroughfares
in our city and in broad open daylight
and without the slightest effort to
hide or conceal the offense and on the
sacred Sabbath; and,
" Whereas, said lynching was in open
violation of all law and offensive to all
decent and law abiding citizens; and
" Whereas, the public oficers with probably
the exception of the sheriff, have
sat silently by and apparently made no
effort to run down and apprehend/ the
members of the mob; and
" Whereas, the judge of the city court
of Bessemer issued a warrant returnable
before one justice of the peace; and
" Whereas, said warrant was changed by
some one without any warrant of authority
from the judge, and made return-
able before another justice of the peace,
and
" Whereas, in our opinion the conduct
with reference to the investigation of the
said crime is worthy of criticism; now,
therefore, be it
" Resolved, That we, the Bessemer Bar
do unqualifiedly go on, record as opposed
to and condemning the spirit of mob
law and mob rule, and we do unqualifiedly
condemn the conduct of, whoever it was,
changing the said warrant and invite, investigation
of the same; and we do se-
the conduct in the inves-
verely censure
tigation with reference to the case, and
we do solicit the aid of the city, county
and state authorities as well as all good
citizens in apprehending and convicting
the parties guilty of the lynching.
" G. H. BUMGARDNER,
" Chairman.

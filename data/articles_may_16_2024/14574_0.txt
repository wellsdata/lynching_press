Lynch Law in Indiana.
CINCINNATI, April 80.- A special to
the Commercial from Seymour, Indi-
ana, says: About two hundred men
entered that town yesterday afternoon
and forcibly seized a negro named Mitch
ell, and took him to the woods and
hang him. They also seized two white
men, named Stewart and threatened to
hang them. The cause of the yio-
lence was the robbery of a store in the
northern part of county, in which
these three men were that engaged.

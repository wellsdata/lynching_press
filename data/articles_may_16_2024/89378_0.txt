Coatesville, Pa., August 14.- No arrests
have been made in connection with the
lynching of the negro, Zachariah Walker,
who last night was dragged from a hospital
and burned alive on the outskirts of
the town. The authorities of Chester
county, it is said tonight, posseses a list
of about 30 men who are alleged to have
been in the mob. Warrants, if any are
issued, will not be sworn out until the
investigation has been completed.
Borough county and state officials are
uniting in efforts to bring the mob lead-
but it is alleged some of
ers to justice
,
the leading citizens of the town are involved
and arrests will not be hastily
made.
The borough council held a special
eeting tonight and adopted resolutions
deploring the lynching and similar resolutions
were passed by the Business
Men's association.
A coroner's jury with Chief of Police
Umsted as foreman, was sworn in today
and an inquest will be held on the body
of Patrolman Rice. What remains of
Walker's body was also viewed by the
coroner's jury, but it adjourned without
trying to place the blame for his death.
Although the burgess of Coatesville reported
that he would be able to handle
the situation without assistance, Sheriff
Golder asked Governor Tenor to send a
squad of state troopers here. Acting
upon this request Captain Wilhelm and
19 troopers started for Coatesville from
Pottsville.
Sheriff Golder and District Attorney
Robert S. Gawtherp of Westchester today
took Policeman Howe, who was on
guard at Walker's bedside when the mob
arrived and a negro hospital attendant to
Weschester, 12 miles across country, and
put them through a severe cros- examination
, seeking to learn the identity of the
men who carried the negro from the
hospital.
The district attorney refused to di-
ruise de If any were tarnished

in the lynching. Everything is quiet

here tonight.
The fearful work of a frenzied mob
here last night when it dragged the
wounded negro from a hospital and
burned him to death for the killing of
Edward Rice, a policeman, Saturday
night, has aroused the greatest indignation
in this, community and everything
possible will be done to bring to justice
the ringleaders of the mob. That
such an affair could occur in a Quaker
community like that in Chester county
I was not believed possible.
Thousands Are Curious
Thousands of persons journeyed out
to the scene of the burning today. Even
before dawn people began to gather at
the spot. Nothing is left of Zachariah
Walker, the victim, but his ashes, all
unburned portions of the hospital cot
that formed part of his pyre had been
gathered up by the souvenir hunters.
Among the angriest people in the
community are some of those who captured
Walker yesterday afternoon in a
Woods near here. He had two revol-
vers with him and when he was surrounded
by the posse he threatened
them. Several of the man hunters
fired at him and wounded him slightly
. Evidently believing that he was
to be shot to death. Walker tried suicide
, sending a bullet into his head.
He fell to the ground and was quick-
ly captured by the crowd. With no
thought of lynching, but with the determination
of having him tried quickly
for the murder of Rice, the posse laid
him across three shoots and carried
him to a waiting automobile, which
brought him to the Coatsville hospital.
When he reached the hospital, Walker
confessed his crime to Chief of Police
Umstead and District Attorney Gaw-
throp.

crowd increased, the talk of lynching
spread, and finally a masked man
mounted the steps of the hospital and
shouted:
" Men of Coatesville, will you let a
drunken negro do up such a white
man as Rice?"
The orderly crowd was instantly
transformed into a riotous mob. The
attack on the hospital was then made.
There were only the superintendent,
four nurses and a policeman in the institution
at the time and a defense
of the negro was impossible. The
crowd swarmed into the place through
doors and windows and before most
of the mob knew it, the wounded and
frightened negro was being taken out
of the building. Still lying on the cot,
he was carried through the streets and
out of the city to the Newland warm.
He had been tied to the bed with ropes
and as the crowd tore fence rails and
gathered wood and other inflama-
bles, Walker writhed on his cot and
tugged at his bonds, but could not

Pleads for Mercy
The negro pleaded for mercy. He declared
he killed Rice in self- defense when
the latter tried to arrest him for firing a
revolver.
" Don't give me a crooked dea! because
I am not white," he said. Only vile
oaths greeted his pleas.
All the leaders in the crowd wore masks
made of bandkerchiefs tied around their
faces up to the eyes. They carried on
taeir work quickly, and after piling up
the rubbish, placed the cot with its shuddering
victim upon it over the pile.
A
dozen matches, it seemed, were simultaneously
applied to the pyre and in an
instant the negro was enveloped in the
flames. The fire burned the ropes that
held him and he made a dash for liberty.
Walker reached a fence and was about
to climb it when stalwart hands seized
bim and dragged him back and hurled
him into the flames. He writhed in

Hello there, here and everywhere
. Another Negro was lynched
in Georgia, the sheriff claims he
doesn't know who did it. I am just
wondering how much money the
government or state is going to
spend to catch his murder. I dare
say the case is closed.
What has happened to our civil
liberties, we as Negroes are denied
the right to freedom of opportunity
here in our native country. Our
constitution gives men equal rights,
it doesn't say some men but all
men. Yet we are denied jobs, we
are denied food in certain places
and least a fair and equal justice
in court; in some parts of the country
.
One of the basic principles of our
democracy is freedom and opportunity
for all. If this is the Ameri-
can creed let's demand a civil rights
law guaranteeing full rights to us
as Negroes. All people regardless
of who they are, or where they
come from, if they are not Negroes,
have the freedom of which we so
desired, since the first of our forefathers
landed on these shores.
When justice is spoken off, I
don't think it means us Negroes,
or does it? I would like for someone
to explain the maning of the" Land
of the Free" to me if it can be done,
or either the home of the brave.
I have heard it all of my life, but
I have never seen words put into
action. I just hope my life span is
extended long enough to see those
words put into action, yet I just
hope it isn't too long that I will be
bent too feeble to know, the difference
. Yet we must not forget
that prayer changes things and
faith is the substance of all things.
The best definition of audacity,
I believe is the will to win! We owe
to all our pioneers a debt of gratitude
for their sacrifices, courage
and privations they endured that
we might enjoy fruits of their toil
and prayers. If it hadn't been for
the prayers of our fore- parents no
doubt Abe Lincoln would not have
been touched or moved by the
to give Negroe's freedom we
spirit enjoy. After all there is no condi-
tion which could be worse. To daring
and audacity, we owe our free
way of life which is ours as much
as any other individual. Our
memory thought for today," Well
arranged time is the surest mark
well arranged minds."
of ByeNow- so long-' til then.

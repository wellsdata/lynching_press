The friends of the men who were
wounded are declaring loudly and
boastingly that they will kill Sheriff
Whitlock as soon as the troops are
withdrawn, but it is not likely that they
will harm a hair on his head. The ruf-
flans who make up lynching mobs are
usually cowards. If they are opposed
are
by pusillanimous officials who
thinking about votes rather than about
doing their duty, they appear very,
very brave. But when they find themselves
face to face with a man who
isn't afraid to shoot hurt, they turn
and run like a pack of to yellow dogs.

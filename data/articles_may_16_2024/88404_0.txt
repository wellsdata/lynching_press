Judges Ignored.
The mob which lynched the negor
stormed the jail shortly after 6 o'clock
tonight. Jurge R. E. L. Johnson of the
Criminal Court and Judge R. H. Dud-
ley of the Civil Court urged the men
to allow the law to take its course
Judge Johnson said that he would immediately
call a special session of
Craighead circuit court to be convened
January 12 to try the black. How
ever, the mob in so many words told
the jurists it would be best for them to
" be on their way unless they wanted
to see the negro hanged." The judges
then left.
Several members of the mob, composed
of between 300 and 400 men,
located Jailer Tom Carter and told
him that unless he produced the keye
to the jail they would batter down
to the doors. The jailer surrendered the
keys. Between 75 and 100 men enter-
the jail, located Thomas in his cell,
ed and dragged him out.

In the fifty- two lynchings the vic-
tims of all but two were negroes.
Three negresses were included in the
list. Alleged crimes against women
and girls and the murder of white
persons account for practically all
of the cases.
A singular feature is found in the
lynching of the two white men, both
of which occurred in the far north.
in each case the victim was accused
of murder. In the town of Joppa, a
short distance from Rosebud, Mont ..
Harry Heffner, alleged slayer of Mrs.
William Merrill, was taken from the
county jail by a crowd of masked men
and hanged, despite the efforts of the
sheriff and his deputy. The second
lynching occurred at Steele, N. D.,
where George Baker, charged with
the murder of his wife and father- in-
law, was taken from the jail and
hanged by a mob. The lynching was
the first recorded in North Dakota
in more than a decade.
The lynching in Wyoming was one
of the most sensational of the year.
Frank Wigfali, a negro, who confessed
to having made a criminal attack on
Mrs. Esther Higgins, an aged woman
known as the" prisoners' friend," was
lynched by the convicts of the state
Penitentiary at Rawlins.
In the West Virginia lynching the
victim was Walter Johnston, a negro
accused of assaulting a young white
girl in Mercer County.
California's one lynching was out
of the ordinary. It occurred on the
desert, soine thirty miles from the
town of Mojave. The victim was an
unknown negro accused of having a
tacked a six- year- old child. He was
hanged by men alleged to be em-
pioyed on the Los Angeles aqueduct.
The three negresses who fell victim
to mob violence were Ann Boston,
who murdered the wife of a planter
at Pine hurst, Cal .; Mary Johnson,
Teached who was lynched in Panoia, county,
Texas, for alleged complicity in the
murder of a white man, and an up-
known negress who, together with
three negroes, was hanged by a mob
in Harris county, Georgia, for the
murder of a farmer.
Tyler. Texas, furnished the only
instance of the year where the victim
was burned at the stake. On May
25 Dan Davis, a negro who had con-
fessed to a criminal attack on a young
white woman, was burned at the
stake in one of the main streets of
Tyler in the presence of a crowd of
two thousand persons.
The foregoing record does not comprise
cases of plain murder or cases
where the victim was killed a
posse while resisting capture. by

JOHNSTOWN RIOT

THREE MEN KILLED
The Affair Followed Upon the Heels
of an Easter Celebration.
Johnstown, Pa .. April 16.- Three
men have been shot dead, a boy fatal-
ly wounded and a mining engineer,
Eugene Delaney, seriously injured in
i a riot at Windber, among the striking
coal miners tonight. The place is
in a state of terror, Sheriff Begley has
been summoned and av appeal has
been made to Governor Pennypacker
for troops. Several others of the rioters
have sustained slight injuries. The
dead men and most of the injured are
foreigners and their names cannot be
obtained. The bodies are lying in the
street tonight where they fell,
the
strikers refusing to let the undertakers
remove them.
The foreign element has been celebrating
Easter Monday in the mining
section and much liquor has been
used. The streets had been thronged
all day with a boisterous crowd, but
no sign of trouble appeared until tonight
. A body of strikers were assembled
in front of the Windber jail
discussing the mass meeting that had
been held during the afternoon and
which had been addressed by three
Catholic priests. The discussion grew
into an argument, and soon there was
a free- for- all fight. Strike deputies
made a number of arrests. All of the
arrested men were union men and their
colleagues set up a cry that they were
being discriminated against.
The arrested men were marched to
the jail door, but there a mob had
formed and an attempt was made to
take the men from the officers. Fore-
ed back from the jail door, the mob,
growing more violent every minute,
threatened the deputies, until the officers
fired. When the smoke had
cleared away and the victims of the
shots were viewed by the crowd, there
were cries of anger and soon the
miners, who were armed, returned the
shots of the deputies. The firing
ceased almost as soon as it began,
however, and the crowd filed
away
from the jail. There is much dynamite
stored here and it is feared the strikers
will resort to the explosive in
venge. re-

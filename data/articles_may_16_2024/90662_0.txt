All the lynchings within twenty- one
years that he could verify have been
tabulated by Mr. Cutler of Yale university
. In that time 1,872 negroes
have been lynched and 1,256
whites.
Since the whites are about six times as
numerous as the blacks, the proportion
of negroes lynched is, of course, very
much higher than these figures indicate
. Only 35 per cent of these negroes
were lynched for the social crime that
is usually associated in the mind
this method of punishment. The num- with
ber of lynchings has diminished since
1892. Arizona has the cleanest record
of any section of the union outside
New England. There has not been a
lynching in this territory in
years. sixteen

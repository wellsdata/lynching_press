Hiding Until His
Identifies
Victim Attacker
WIGGINS, Miss., June 22 .-( P)-
A 25- year- old negro identified by
officers as R. D. McGee, accused of
attempting to attack the 11- year-
old daughter of a white farmer,
was lynched Saturday two miles
east of Wiggins by a mob of white
men estimated at between 200 and
400 men.
Seized From Bed
The alleged attack upon the
white girl occurred Friday afternoon
and a posse of citizens which
formed into an infuriated mob in
Stone county seized the negro from
his bed Friday night at his home
near Wiggins and carried him into
the woods.
There McGee was hidden away
from the officers and it was de-
clared that he was identified by
the white girl and also by a negro
girl who said she had seen him
" hanging around."
One eye witness quoted the negro
as admitting that he had beaten
the white girl and as saying that
he did not know why he did it except
that" I must have been crazy."
The child was reported attacked
blackberries in a
while picking
pasture near her home. She bore
bruises on her face and neck.
Hanged From Tree
The mob hanged the negro from
woodland tree Saturday morning
between 8 and 9 o'clock and
riddled his body with bullets. They
left the body hanging and dispersed
.
Sheriff J. A. Simpson, of Stone
county, said Saturday that the mob
had successfully hidden the hunted
man from him and his officers
during the night and that he had
not had McGee in his custody.
The scene of the lynching was
in one of the remote rural sec-
tions of south Mississippi. No
rests had been made at last reports ar-.

RESCUED FROM MOB
AFTER FOUL MURDER
A FOREIGNER SHOOTS DOWN HIS
CHUM AND THEN STARTS TO
CHOP HIS BODY PIECES
WITH A HATCHET. TO
Pittsburg, Pa., August 5.- After, as it
is charged by the police, shooting down
his chum in cold blood and then attempting
to chop the body to pieces with a
hatchet in the street at Blair station,
twenty- four miles from this city, Adam
LaCache, a foreigner, was rescued from
a mob that tried to lynch him tonight
and was landed in jail at Clayton.
The shooting was the result of a complaint
of misdemeanor made to the police
by Joseph Warech against LaCache. The
latter met Warech in the main street tonight
and asked him why he made the
complaint. Before Warech could reply
LaCache shot him twice.
Warech fell mortally wounded and La-
Cache drew from his clothing a hatchet.
The shots attracted a crowd and LaCache
threw away the hatchet with which he
was about to slash his victim. He finally
took refuge in a pile of brush, where he
was suprrounded by the mob and upon
a demand that he give himself up he
presented himself armed with the revolver
and threatened to shoot. The man was
immediately taken in charge by the mob,
and while cooler heads parleyed with
the mob the police spirited LaCache
away to the jail.
Warech was taken to the McKeesport
hospital, where he died in a few minutes.
Warech and LaCache had been close
friends for several years but a weke ago
it said that they had trouble over a
woman is.

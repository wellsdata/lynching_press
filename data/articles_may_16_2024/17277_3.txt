HEARTS MUST CHANGE
COURAGEOUS STATEMENTS
concerning our failings as a nation
will do much to help bring about
an America fit for all Americans.
White America is not so much wicked
toward Negro America as it is
ignorant of Negro America. Ideas,
opinion, feelings and emotions lie
at the very foundation of this
American race problem. When,
therefore, we change these feelings
, ideas, and attitudes into what
they shld be, the problem will
be solved. As in religion so in race-
relations- there must be a heart
change, a conversion. You can't
change the heart of a people by
law. And as long as segregation and
lynch law are written in the
hearts of a people, this attitude will
make itself manifest in spite of law.
For men to act differently they
must see, think and feel differently.
Let those who have the foresight
to see, the wisdom to understand
and the courage to speak, against
monsters, prejudice, race- hate
the and lynch- law, continue to speak.

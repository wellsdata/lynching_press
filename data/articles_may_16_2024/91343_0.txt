On Thursday night C. J. Dieffenbacher
shot and killed a man named Melsted at
Virginia, Cass county, Ill. On Saturday
night a mob attacked the jail in Blards-
town, where Dieffenbacher was confined,
with the avowed purpose of hanging him.
The jail was well guarded and the mob
was repulsed. In revenge the outlaws set
fire to the town, and before the flames
could be extinguished an entire block of
buildings in the place was destroyed. The
excitement in the village is intense, and
more trouble is anticipated. to

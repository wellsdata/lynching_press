COLUMBUS, Fla., Nov. 14.- This neighborhood
is greatly worked up over the
recent lynching of the negro Henry
Boggs, who murdered W. J. Duncan
at Lake City Junction last Monday,
the horrible mutilation of the colored
man's body and the mysterious
disappearance of three other negroes.
Boggs is said to have been taken away
from the officers and stabbed and shot
to death by the mob. The story is that
as soon as the mol got possession of
the man it began the work of death
by cutting in vari-
into
the flesh
ous parts of the body. To silence
his cries a handkerchief was crowded
into his mouth. It is further reported
that his eyes were first stitched up and
then gouged out. The sockets were
eyeless when the body was found the
next day. As to the other men-
three in number- implicated in the
murder of Duncan, they are said
to have escaped from the officers
who had them in charge Thursday
night. Some say with a meaning smile
that the men made their escape by
breaking apart the handcuffs which
held them together and taking to their
heels under fire. It is the general
opinion here that they were
and tortured. lynched

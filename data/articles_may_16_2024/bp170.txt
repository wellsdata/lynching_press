WILDWOOD, Fla. Some 200

Object of an intensive search by
police, airplanes and bloodhounds
is Jesse Wocds, 28, who was lodg-
ed in the Wildwood jail after al
legedly making "indecent" re.
marks to a white woman.
According to Police Chief Ed
Mullis, Woods, a farm laborer, who
recently returned to his home aft-
er spending several years in a
northern city, was arrested Sat-
urday afternoon on a charge of
drunkness and disorderly conduct.
AT MARKET
Mullis said Woods called out
"Hey, honey" or "Hey, Baby" to
a white woman, Evelyn Hill, who
had been shopping in a super.
market. Woods had been ejected
from the market after creating a
disturbance.
The police chief arrested Woods
after the alleged remark a nd
placed the prisoner in the one-
story frame jail, which is located
across the street from a movie
theater.
Mullis said that about four
hours after the arrest, Woods' fa-
ther, who operates a truck farm
near here, posted $50 cash bond
for his son's release.
A few minutes after they walk-
ed out of the jail together, they
returned, stating that some
white men were following them
and they were scared." Woods
was locked up in the cell for his
own safety.
RE-ENTER JAIL
It was about midnight when the
pair re-entered the jail, and ae-
cording to Mullis, Woods was
taken from the jail sometime be-
tween midnight and 1 a.m. He
said:
"A midnight show had just let
out and a crowd gathered at the
jail. Most were curiosity seekers.
"The crowd scattered out and
we thought everything was all
right.
"Then when I was seated in my
car in a filling station I saw two
cars come racing by. I gave chase
then I lost them. I returned to
the jail and found Woods was out."
The police chief called in
Sheriff. M.H. Bowman and state
police and deputies to prevent, a
possible racial disturbance.
Mullis said he was not sure it
was white men who took Woods
from the jail. He said:
"There were lots of colored peo.
ple there too. I don't know wheth-
er it was white or colored."
EMPTY CELL
The empty cell was discovered
at 1 a.m. by E. H. Barry, night
patrolman. The door h a d been
forced and the cot on which Woous
slept had been overturned. There
were spatters of blood on the floor.
The search was begun immedi-
ately but late Sunday night there
was no trace of the missing man.
Officers from nearby counties pein-
ed in the hunt.
Mullis said reports had been
circulating all evening that there
was a Negro prisoner in the jail
who had “insulted a white wom-
an.'
He added that there were
quite a few people standing around
when Woods and his father at
tempted to leave the jail.
""
The police chief said he remain-
ed at the jail with Barry and
Austin Palmer, owner of the the
ater and city councilman.
"When the theater closed about
11 a'clock the crowd gradually
thinned out and I had some coffee
with Palmer at a restaurant. We
locked the jaii and Bairy began
his regular rounds in his erauser,"
Mullis said.
ASKED TO LEAVE
A. C. Thornton, manager of the
store where Woods is supposed 10
have caused a disturbance, said
Woods acted in a boisterous man-
ner. Thornton asked him to leave
and threatened to call police.
"Call the damn law for all I
care," Thornton quoted Words as
saying. Woods leit the store be-
fore police arrived.
He is said to ha Y e walked
through a parking lot wher, Miss
Hill and Mrs. C. C. Wadsworth
were getting into a car.
Mrs. Wadsworth sɔid she did not
hear the remark allegedly made
by Woods.
A day-long search failed in jorn
up any trace of Woods and bands
of Negroes from surrounding
counties were reported pouring in-
to Wildwood last night.

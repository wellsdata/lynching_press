girl. The jury was out, five hours.
Miller Acquitted
Two days later William Miller was
tried for the same offense. The same
witnesses made the same testimony
as in the Mason trial, but Miller was
found not guilty.
Counsel for the defense contend
that evidences of Miller's innocence,
which resulted in his acquittal, are applicable
alike to Max Mason, who was
found guilty, and on these grounds
are preparing to ask for a new trial.
Mason was convicted on the word
of Irene Tusken and her escort,
James Sullivan, who swore that they
were set upon by a party of circus
employees, seven of whom were on
trial, and three of whom were lynched,
that Sullivan was held off at pistol
point, while the Nelson girl was criminally
assaulted When Sulivan and
the girl went home, she went to bed
without giving an alarm and without
notifying her parents. Neither did
Sullivan give any alarm other than to
mention the alleged affair to his
father. The next morning Sullivan's
father telephoned to ask the Nelson
girl's father about the assault. This
was his first knowledge of the
posed outrage. sup-

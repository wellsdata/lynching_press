band, Mrs. Mallard broke down
and wept.
Weeping intermittently through-
out her story the widowed mother
declared Klansmen had admitted
by "word of mouth" to a salesman
friend from Cleveland, who had
mingled with the murders after
the fatal shooting, that they had
killed Mallard because he "wore
white shirts and rode around in
an automobile."
Mrs. Mallard's story is as fol-
lows: On that fatal day she and
her husband and two children
were rounding a corner of the
Provident Baptist Church, when
three carloads of men cornered
their car.
From the cars spewed white-
robed men with shotguns and pis-
tols of varicd descriptions.
TRIED TO GET OUT
Almost simultaneously, Mrs.
Mallard said, her husband attempt-
ed to open his car door and get
out, but was met with
gun
blast. Mallards' body fell forward
from the car to the ground. The
murderers kicked his. prone body
and poured more shot into his
lifeless body.
In the meantime, Mrs. Mallard
had
dragged her two
children
down in the car and ducked her-
self, escaping death.
The mob
vanished almost as
suddenly as it appeared, quickly
climbing into their escape vehicles
and soon disappeared.
The agitated and frightened wi-
dow rushed to her prostrate hus,
man's side, called frantically for
help from a nearby farmer. He
came over and examined the body
and declared that "nothing could
live after being riddled with bul-
lets and lead slugs like that."
Mrs. Mallard said that there was
a "hole through the dead man's
heart as big as her fist."
FEARED STATE POLICE
She summoned the state police,
but refused to disclose the names
of any of the killers, whom Mrs.
Mallard said she recognized. be-
cause anyone doing so was mur-
dered through information given
by the Police to members of Dra-
gon Green's horde."
The man's body was removed to
the undertaking parlors of a Ne
gro in Savannah, Ga. On the day
of the funeral, Mrs. Mallard said
three carloads of State Troopers
came to the house.
"Our whole family was there
of 500 at a meeting of the Phil-
adelphia Chapter of the NAACP
at the St. Paul's Baptist Church,
10th and Wallace sts., Friday night.
Mrs. Mallard, the attractive
mother. of two children, was the
principal speaker along with
Donald V. Carter, of Toombstown,
Ga., who with his wife and 10
children were chased North, be-
cause he encouraged the Negro
voters to vote at the polls in the
last election.

Northern Negro as well as the
Southern Negro to "stand up and

They

family, then took only the wife
and her sister-in-law and put them
in one of the cars and drove about
85 miles to Reedsville, Ga.
ACCUSED OF MURDER
She said they never put her in
jail, but accused her of murdering
her husband.
"Here I was free, and as fright-
ened as a rabbit, for fear that
the Klansmen would get me if I
dared to deny what they said at
the time," she said.
Mrs. Mallard said she was then
informed that she was under ar-
rest. She accused the FBI of
working "hand-in-hand" with the
state troopers to implicate her and
exonerate the Klansmen.
The distressed widow closed her
story explaining that she was
forced to give up all her belong-
ings and possessions including her
home by Georgia authorities.
She concluded her address with
the telling of a mistaken identity
murder. She said she was to have
boarded a bus for Macon to
Savannah, Ga. The bus was one
hour late and she did not catch
it.
ANOTHER WOMAN KILLED
Another Negro woman about the
same description as Mrs. Mallard
boarded the bus with her small
child. Enroute, the woman was
taken off the bus without protests
by the driver or passengers and
she and the child brutally beaten
to death. The killers were never
located.
Carter said he was forced to
leave his 10 acre farm. He and
his family are now residing in
Philadelphia.
Music for the program was furn-
ished by the St. Paul's Baptist
Church choir. Miss Lillian Truley
Franklin presented a vocal solo.

the Rev. Jesse F. Anderson and
the invocation by Rev. E. Luther
Cunningham.

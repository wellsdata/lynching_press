The New Orleans Picayune says:
A correspondent, writing to us from
Brooksville Miss. under date of Jan. 31
,,
,
y
" Negroes are proving so troublesome
with us that our planters are bringing
out Danes and other white labor. Three
are now in Illinois for them, and have
orders from nearly every planter. The
hands( negroe) all left their work to- day
the best plow day of the season- to
Lynch a white man and burn Brooksville.
They, however, found the whites collected
to the number of two or three hundred
, and instead of burning the town,
the colored leader of the league got him-
self well shaken by the collar. This
league I regard as a providential concern
sent to show np the negro, and
make, us procure white labor."

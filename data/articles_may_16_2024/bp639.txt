Why We Have Mobs-What
Shall We Do About It?
Did you ever get mixed-up in a
great mob bent on lynching a fellow-
creature? Well, don't do it!
It is one of the most horrific ex-
periences one can undergo, with very
rare exceptions. In my long career
as a newspaper man it has fallen to
me to be
up in four such
congerles of
cruel, uncontrol-
tangled
crazy,
able human beings temporarily turn-
ed savages.
In one case two white men were
strangled to death from the same limb
of a tree. In another a Negro

but were efectually prevented from
interfering with the mob's operations.
In each case the victim was confess-
edly guilty of the crime charged, but
he was in legal custody and would
surely have been convicted and legally
executed.

I would sooner meet the Devil in
full naming regalia on any highway
than to meet and oppose one of our
common city or countryside mobs. The
Devil is a fellow of uncommon sense.
He is willing to argue a case with
you.
He did that several times even
with Christ. And when you resolu-
tely command him to "Get thee
hence!" he gits.
But with a raging-hearted mob it
is a different case altogether.
It is often said that a mob has no
mipd; that it is mass madness and
wholly impelled by a common primi-
tive impulse that puts aching rage
beyond the reach of reason and all
our civilized and Christian inhibitions.
But that diagnosis does not accord
with my experiences with moba. Each
one of them had a master mind at
the head of it and the mass behind
the master had caught his spirit and
come to "one mind and one heart" for
the business at hand.
No lover of organized law and or-
der will justify mob law. No Chris-
tian man or woman can defend it. It
is the sworn duty of ministers of law
and justice to denounce the mob
spirit, to prevent mob reprisals, to
catch and punish mob violators of the
constitution and the laws of the land.
But each mob is its own Moloch. It
laughs at written law and backs Its
agents out of the awful picture. I
have leaned from a window above a
raging mob and seen it defy and beat
off half the police force of a large
city, led by as intrepid a chief as ever
served an American community. Aa
another spectator by me remarked:
"That is hell in action that they are
vainly fighting down there!"

Until every community shall de-
velop that public psychology, no Dyer
federal anti-lynching law, no
statute against riots and mob mur-
ders, no sheriff and no mobilization
of the military, will end the periodi-
cal orgies of Judge Lynch in this land
of the free. "Necessity knows no
law," and a mob always acts from the
conviction that its work is an imme
diate necessity.
During the past 40 years, I believe
it not extravagant to say, I have
heard probably a thousand men ex-
cuse mob lynchings on the ground
that the people had no confidence in
the certainty and celerity of justice
through the courts.
How can that sort of common feel-
Ing be dealt with? When judges can
be generally charged with playing in-
to the hands of the defense lawyers
of criminals and opening to their use
every possible loop-hole of the law,
a situation obtains where the major-
ity sentiment of the community will
more surely sympathize with the mob
than with the magistracy.

legislature can enact will stop a mob

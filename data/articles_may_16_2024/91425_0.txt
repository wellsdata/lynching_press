A NEGRO LYNCHED.
A Miscreant Who Insulted a Lady
Hanged to a Convenient Tree.
RICHMOND, Va., Aug. 3.- Advices received
here give disgusting details of an attempted
assault on a young married lady, named Mrs.
Harrison, by a brutal negro named John
Fitzburgh, near Amissville, in Rappahannock
county, followed by the lynching of the latter
last night. Fitzburgh was fifty years old
and had been attending a colored church in
the neighborhood of the lady's home on Sun-
day last. He saw Mr. Harrison, her husband,
leave home that night, and knew that he was
not expected to return. Fitzburgh then went
home, armed himself with
a revolver
and came back to Mr. Harrison's. Mrs.
Harrison was seated on the porch with an
infant in her arms. The negro, who was in
a nude condition, made infamous proposals
to her. She ran into the house, bolted the
door and screamed for help. Her cries were
heard by a doctor and a young man in the
vicinity. They quickly came, but being unarmed
, did not kill the negro. They drove
him off, however, but he returned again and
was again driven away. The lady was protected
by her neighbors until the return of
husband
her arrested
. The negro was and
lodged in the county jail the following day.
Since then the news of the occurrence spread
and the indignation of the people arose to a
retributive heat. This culminated last night
in the formation of a mob of lynchers, who
forcibly took Fitzburgh from the jail and
hanged him to a convenient tree. There was
very little noise or excitement about it, and
after effectually doing their lawless work
lynchers retired. the

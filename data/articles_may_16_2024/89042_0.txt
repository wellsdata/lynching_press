MURDERER LYNCHED.
A California Mob Hang a Chinese
Murderer.
SAN FRANCISCO, July 18.- The San
Francisco company of National Guard
troops was placed at the jail at Colusa,
California, July 11, by order of the
Governor to protect the Chinese murderer
, Honodi, who shot and killed Mrs.
Billow six months ago. The excitement
of the populace regarding the verdict,
fixing the penalty at imprisonment for
life, was so great that an organized at
tack on the jail was regarded as imminent
. The excitement having apparently
died away, the guards were removed.
Shortly before midnight a band of armed
men numbering nearly two hundred surrounded
the jail and seized the sheriff.
An entrance to the jail haying been effected
, a search for the Chinaman began,
who was found secreted under the jailor's
room, having been placed there by means
of a trap door. He was taken to China-
town where he was hanged to a turn
table in the railroad yards. His crime
was the killing Mrs. Billow, for whom
he worked. He of had no provocation.

TENDER MERCIES OF SLAVERY. Five
slaves recently attempted to escape from servitude
at Petersburg, Virginia, in the schooner
Keziah, Captain Win. Baylis, of Brandy-
wine, Delaware. Some of the negroes being
missed a steamer was sent in pursuit of
the vessel, and she we brought back to
Petersburg, the negroes on board and Capt.
Baylis and the Mate Simpkins under arrest
The woman was found concealed in the
midst of a lot of bacon under the cabin floor,
and the four men secreted in the cargo of
wheat. When the prisoners were landed the
nob attempted to lynch them, and the threatened
violence was arrested with thuch dif-
cuity. Capt. Baylis was tried in the Circuit
Court on the 10th and was sentenced by
Judge Nash to the Peditentiaay for forty
years, for the terrible crime of aiding his
fellow men in escaping from lile- long servitude

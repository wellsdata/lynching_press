The following, which came by way of
telegraph, reminds us of something
else:
BULLETIN
Anadarko, Okla., June 13.- An
unknown negro was lynched here
early today.
-cf- 1023a.
About 18 years ago we picked up a
Florida daily, and in scanning the local
paragraphs, reached something like
this:
" Col. Splosham shot a nigger at
Fourth and Lafayette last night."
It is almost parallel, showing conclusively
, however, that the Oklahoma
correspondent has the decency to refrain
from calling a colored gentleman
by his nickname. Otherwise it shows
no improvement of the Oklahoma of
yesterday over the Florida of 18 years
ago.
Burt Brown says the principal mistake
made by Mr. Hodges is that he
neglected to ask the Stubbs bunch for
advice about running the administration
. Mr. Hodges made the same mistake
in conducting his Olathe lumber
yard; he neglected to ask some bankrupt
lumber firm for advice.
The idea that people demand something
new in the way of entertainment
refuted by" Pop" Mathews, who has
spent a lifetime in promoting out- doorhis
amusements. He says there is nothing
so funny as a greased pig. He claims
that the
average human is not in
search of risk or carnage, and that a
normal pleasure seeker would rather
view the" hazing" of an oiled porker
than the slaughter of a ferocious bull.
Chasing the greased razorback does
not hurt him- it merely annoys him,
argues" Pop," and the spectacle is not
shocking to the most sensitive nature.
The S. P. C. A. might interview the
greased pig and get his side of the
question before passing judgment on
the ancient sport.
" Under the new law, new obstacles
have been thrown in the path of matrimony
," says a local office clerk," but so
far as I am concerned, they are unnecessary
. A careful slant at my
monthly pay check answers the pur-
pose, without any legal restrictions."
One advantage to graduating from
West Point is that the graduate may
thereafter play polo- a game prohibited
ordinary people by reason of the expense
- at the expense of the taxpayers
.
-
The shooting of the colored person
should have been delayed 24 hours. Had
it occurred on Friday the thirteenth,
it would have proven the contention
that the combination is unlucky.
Kansas City is so hard up that it
proposes to re- establish the red- light
district. Topeka is hard up, but the
only red lights in Topeka are on autos
or holes in unrepaired pavements.
There are still reasons for refraining
from moving from Topeka to Kansas
City.
In the Santa Fe- State House game,
the railroaders will cover third with
an almost- brave of the Winnebagos.
The state house gang proposes to off-
I set this alien handicap by using a
janitor, who is one- forty- seventh
Hottentot, as official water boy.
But it will be a game worth viewing
. The purpose is not so much to!
play baseball as to show Gov. Hodges
what he doesn't know about pitching.
EVENING CHAT
ST RUTH CAMERON.
The Unbelievableness of Death.
" A simple child that lightly draws its
breath
And feels its life in every limb,
What should it know of death!"
-Wordsworth.
There is vigorous, full
of life
a
young woman among my friends who
always says in place" when I die,"" if
I die." Her explanation is that although
in her mind she knows that
she will die, she cannot seem to believe
in her heart that this strange
thing will really come to her.
Most of us are not so frank. And
yet don't we all have this same feeling
in greater or less degree? We know
in our minds that of course we must
die some time, but do we actually
sense it? I don't believe we do.
One day last summer I spent an
hour or so wandering through a very
old New England cemetery- or to use
the better and braver term for it-
burying round.
Perhaps you may think that is a
very queer way to spend a golden hour
in summer, but if you ever happen to
be near a burying ground over which
time has thrown the softening veil of
romance, try it some day. I am sure
that in the half obliterated Nehemiahs
and Samanthas and Pollys and
Thomases, in the moss covered dates
and" Aetats" and the quaint inscriptions
, you will find many a half told
tale to awaken your imagination.
But to return to the main theme.
As we wandered through the quaint
old burying ground, we came upon a
stone marked" 1812." The man whose
name was upon it and died at the
age of 80 after a good long life. And
he had been dead one hundred years!
Of course the same thought came into
the minds of both of us." Just think,
he has been dead and buried over a
hundreds years! Some day we, too,
will have been dead a hundred years,
and someone else will stand by our
graves and read our names on the
tombstones."
An inevitable and tremendous
thought! And yet it made so little
impression that in two or of
upon us
three minutes we were talking lightly
of the most frivolous topics.
You see we didn't believe it, at least
not with the real belief that comes
from the heart rather than the mind.
" As a matter of fact," says Steven- ly
son in Aes Triplex," although few
things are spoken of with more fearful
whispering than this prospect of
death, few have less influence on conduct
under healthy circumstances."
And he goes on to say that while we
wonder how people who live in cities
built on the sides of fiery, volcanic|
mountains can eat and drink and
make merry, and think so little about
their mortal condition, we are all very
much like them. For though we live
continually in the presence and possibility
of death, yet as a matter of
fact, we think surprisingly little
about it.
Yes, when you come to think of it,
the unbelievableness of death to the
average person, in view of our daily
acquaintance with that great fact, is
one of the queer quirks of the human
brain. Or may it not be something
bigger and better- a proof of our in- 1
realization of our own im-
stinctive mortality?

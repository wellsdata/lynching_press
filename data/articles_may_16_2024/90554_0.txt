A Sensible Verdict.
SAN BERNARDINO, April 8.- A coroner's
inquest was held on the body of Jesus
Fuen, wo was lynched by a mob last
night. It was found that he came to
his death by hanging at the hands of
parties unknown to the jury. No attempt
was made to discover who the
leaders of the mob were, and it is even
rumored that two or three of the coroner's
jury were participants in
hanging bee. Talk of arrests is dying the
out, though few of the mob wore masks
and a number are well known to
dreds of spectators. hun-

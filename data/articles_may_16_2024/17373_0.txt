ASKS SURVEY
OF DIXIE LIFE
Dr. Poteat Urges Baptists
Get at Truth of Disputed
Phases
MEMPHIS, Tenn., May 18.-
( UP) The Southern Baptist convention
was asked yesterday by
Dr. E. McNeil Poteat, Jr., Ra-
leigh, N. C., to establish a bureau
of social research to cull away the
propaganda and ascertain the
truth about controversial phases
of southern life.
His references to the plight of
sharecroppers in Arkansas and to
charges of injustices to union laborers
in textile mills attracted
Ichief attention.
" There have been complaints
of conceivable injustice
every
done in the name of profit," Dr.
Poteat said. He mentioned reports
that families had been forced to
flee from Arkansas farms be-
cause their lives were threatened
when they organized to protect
their rights.
" I am interested in knowing
whether these things are true,'
"
he said." A research agency
should find out."
Because of rules of the church,
action on the report made by Dr.
Poteat as chairman of the social
service committee, was deferred
until next year.
Late in the day, the convention
chose St. Louis for its 1935 meet-
ing place.
The social service commission's
report, submited by Chairman A.
J. Barton, Wilmington, N. C., opposing
lynching, motion pictures
which make crime and vice seem
alluring, and liquor, was adopted.
Dr. Poteat's report was post-
poned because its adoption would
involve the expenditure of additional
funds. He recommended appointment
of a paid secretary and
an assistant to man the proposed
social research bureau.
The bureau should be" so free
that the most objective of studies
might not be interfered with," he
said. It should' discover facts as
they exist, whether they reflect
creditably or not upon te activities
of the convention or general
southern Baptist attitudes.
Beside the study of conditions
among sharecroppers and textile
workers, Dr. Poteat, proposed the
bureau should seek the truth
about the liquor question, unemployment
, mob violence in lynchings
and other factors of" confu-
sion in our social life.".
ive B. Lawrence, Atlanta, execu-
J.
secretary of the home
board, reported last night that
during 1934 the board received
from all sources,$ 320,030,95, an
increase of$ 81,330.42 over 1933.
He said the board operated within
its budget and for the first
time several years hasn't had
to borrow in money.

what happened in Monroe,
gia where four Negroes
lynched on July 25th. It repre-
sents a pattern for suppressing
the rights and liberty of minority
groups in this country.
pattern is that of Hitler
the people who are responsible for
the use of Nazi methods in lynch-'
ing four American citizens in.
Georgia are not brought to jus-.
tice, if this pattern of terrorism
and murder is not disavowed by
the American people, then there
is no minority group in this coun-
try which is secure against the
same kind of injustice to which
the Negroes of Georgia have been
subjected.
If we have learned anything
from the experience of mankind
under Hitlerism it is that injus-
tice working through terrorism
must be stopped when it first ap-
pears. Had the people of Germany
refused to permit persecution of
the Jews they would all have been
spared the experience of persecu-
tion by the Nazi tyranny at a later
time.
What happened in Monroe,
Georgia is not simply the concern
of Negroes. The injustice done to
them is an injustice done to us all.
The human rights violated in their
case is the violation of the rights
of us all.

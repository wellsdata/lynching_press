OMAHA, Neb., Oct. 10.- Seven members
of the mob which lynched the
negro rapist, last night, are under arrest
, charged with murder in tha first
degree. County Attorney Mahoney refused
to allow the prisoners bail, and by
7 p. m. a large crowd surrounded the jail
and threatened, if the prisoners were
not given their liberty, that the jail
would be attacked and the men liberated
. The men under arrest are Ed
Neuschalfer, Patrick O'Herne, John
Fritz, R. G. Bloom, H. H. Brandis, Ed
Fitzgerald and John O'Donoghue.
County Attorney Mahoney sent word
that the men would not be released
under any circumstances, and the crowd
at once began to lay plans for attacking
the jail.
When the mob gathered in front of
the jail, Jailor Harrigan appeared and
announced that none of the men wanted
were there. Offering to escort a committee
of ten through the building, the
crowd accepted the proposition, and the
committee reported the men gone. Five
of the prisoners had been released on
bai !, the other two were taken to
Papillion and.

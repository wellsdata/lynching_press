Being Sought For by an Indiana
Crowd.
Hartford City, Ind., Aug. 4- George
Hearshey, an invalid aged 19, while
hunting squirrels on his father's farm
near here at noon today, was approached
by two prowling negroes. They
grabbed the boy, searched his clothing
for money, and, finding none, tore his
clothing from him. While one negro
held him another mutilated him with a
knife. The boy succeeded in reaching
home.
He told his story and his father gave
the alarm, mounted a horse and called
for volunteers to wreak vengeance on
the fleeing negroes. Two hundred men
and boys joined in the chase. No trace
of the negroes was found. The hunt
proceeded until night fall. The sheriff
with detachment of deputies and police
followed the mob to prevent
if possible. lynching

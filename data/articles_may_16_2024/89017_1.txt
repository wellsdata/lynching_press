Fikua William, a Aug. 17.- CHICAGO,
Narrowly Escaped Being Lynched.
colored man from Nashville, Tenn.,
came dangerously near being lynched
last night.
He had
in the street
snatched a pocketbook from a woman and
was captured after a long chase through
the down town streets. During his
flight he fired three times at the police
and the crowd which followed the officers
in the pursuit. The officers halted
at Madison and Clark streets to wait
for the patrol wagon and the crowd
made a desperate effort to take Fikua
from them. Ropes were procured and
if the colored man had been taken from
police he would certainly have been
the hanged.

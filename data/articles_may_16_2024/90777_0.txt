Mob Hung Her to Tree, But
Killed Six and Made
He His Get- a- way.
Athens, Ga., Feb. 2- Two
little boys( one white) got to
fighting in a town a few miles
from here and the result was
that the mother of the Race
boy slapped the white one.
12 men formed a mob and
took her to the outskirts of
the city and lynched her.
They hung her body to a tree
and then went to where her
husband was working and
asked him to come and help
them cut down a cow which
was too heavy for them. He
went and was dumfounded
when he saw that it was his
wife. He humbly begged of
them to allow him to go home
and get a sheet to wrap it a
round her. They consented.
1hey waited to watch him,
but he had beat them to it.
Approaching them, he opened
fire, killing six. Before
they could get him he made
his escape. The Associated
press never said anything a
bout the matter

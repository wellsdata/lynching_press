CROSS CURRENTS CURRENTS
By C. E. CHAPMAN CHAPMAN E. C.
The Federal Government has been
profoundly lethargic when thousands
of Negroes were lynched, but the
worm has now turned. "Whatsoever
3 man soweth, that shall he also
reap."
The above truth was truth nearly
two thousand years ago, and it is
not one whit less truth today. The
American white man has been sow
ing to the wind and is now reaping
a whirlwind.
Even President Hoover, head of
what is termed the greatest and most
powerful government of the whole
world, has time to find occasion to
be horrifled about the kidnaping of
the Lindbergh baby (no word of cen-
sure against him for that, per se);
yet he can and does treat with in-
describable silence and utter disre-
gard, apathy and unconcern the
lynching of helpless Negroes, which
is one of America's favorite pas-
times. The reason, of course, is:
The victims of the lynchers are Ne-
groes and poor, while the victims of
the kidnapers are white and rich,
almost without exception.
And what about the change from
lynching poor Negroes to kidnaping
rich whites?
The rich and unconcerned white
people are being made to share just
a little of what poor Negroes have
been sharing and experiencing
through the centuries. Just the other
day we heard an aged Negro in Ok-
lahoma tell a crowd of lamenting
whites that they were now just be-
ginning to taste what has been the
poor Negro's "meat and bread" for
hundreds of years, though in a dif-
ferent way; that he (the aged Ne-
gro) had often seen poor Negro
mothers seek to iss their children
when being sold apart during the
days of slavery, and that some heart-
less culprit-white, of course-would
literally kick the mothers back in!
line rather than let them embrace
their own flesh and blood ance more.
Truly it must be: The mills of God
grind surely, even though slowly.
AND THAT WHICH GOES O'ER
THE DEVIL'S BACK MAY SOME-
TIME, OFTTIMES DOES, COME
UNDER. HIS BELLY!"
This utter disregard for law and
order, this trampling and denying
black people of the constitutional and
inalienable rights on the part of the
whites ONLY hastens the day when
they (the whites), who either per-
mitted it or perpetrated it, shall
share the same fate themselves. Yes,
the governmental authorities have
permitted some of its poor citizens
to be lynched for NOTHING, now
the shoe is on the other foot, and
rich white people are being kidnaped
for SOMETHING.
And that's making lawlessness a
paying proposition from a pecuniary
viewpoint. This change from lynch-
ing-good sport for many Americans
of the Nordic species, but financially
proftless-to-kidnaping for large fi-
nancial remuneration, is but unim-
peachable evidence that the fallure
to enforce ONE part of the Consti-
tution is but paving the way and
giving encouragement to the disre-
gard of ANY other part of the Con.
stitution; that obedience to ONE
part CAOT do other than breed
respect for the OTH parts. Hence,
disregard, apathy, lethargy, uncon-
cern, complacency on the part of the
American people and the American
government as to the rights, privi-
leges, safety, peace, woll-being, hap-
piness and the like of the Negro ele-
ment of the population ONLY does
what is inevitable: It speeds on the
day when the whites, themselves,
shall drink full and bitter dose of
their OWN medicine! To disregard
one part breeds disregard for ALL
parts.

Trial Ends; Ruling Seen By '49
Judge Admits School
Facilities Deplorable
in the suit against
ROANOKE, Va.-(NNPA)-Testimony
Pulaski County school officials asking for equal facilities for
colored school children was brought to a close in the United
States District Court here last Thursday afternoon, but
there were indications that Judge Alfred D. Barksdale, of
Lynchburg, who heard the two-day trial, will not give a rul-
ing until the first of the year,ROANOKE
As attorneys for both sides an-
nounced they were
resting their
cases, the judge commented, that
"one thing has been demonstrated
here without need for argunient. It
is the fact that (school) facilities in
Virginia are deplorable."
Opposing counsel declined Judge
Barksdale's offer to hear brief oral
arguments, saying they preferred to
submit them in writing at later
dates.
â€¢
Attorneys for the plaintiffs were
granted thirty days after receipt of
the transcript of the testimony to
file their brief, and defense counsel
was gvien thirty days from this date,
with an additional 15 days allotted
to the plaintiffs' counsel to make
answer if this is considered advis-
able.
The principal witness for the de-
fense this afternoon was Frank J.
Criser, of Pulaski, county superin-
tendent of schools, who sought to
justify conditions about which the
plaintiffs had complained by point-
ing out that most of the elementary
schools of the county are two, or
three-room structures with outside
toilet facilities and some without
runnnig water on the premises.
Criser termed some of the county's
school problems "war born" and said
that work has been started on a new
is designed to rectify some of these
conditions, mentioning specifically
that work has ben started on a new
building near Radford to replace
the present Fairlawn School and
permit the single grouping of chil-
dren now
taught in the base-
4
ments of two churches.
The overail teacher load in the
county is about forty students, Cris-
er stated.
Dr. Fred M. Alexander, director of
secondary education of the State
Department of Education, testified
last Thursday morning that the
Christiansburg Industrial Institute,
which serves as a high school for
colored pupils in Pulaski county,
and the Pulaski High School, one
of the three white high schools in
the county, rank above the Virginia
average.
Another witness offered by the
defense-Herman Ratcliffe, a visit-
ing teacher in the Pulaski system-
related that there are a number of
children in the county who do not
attend school for the sole reason
they lack transportation or have
too far to walk. Some of these, he
explained, should be enrolled in Pu-
laski High School.
Throughout the trial, the court-
room was packed, largely with col-
ored people.
It was
the contention of the
plaintiffs that school authorities
are not meeting their constitution-
al responsibilities in providing equal
facilities for colored pupils.
Several witnesses were presented
by counsel for the plaintiffs, head-
ed by Oliver W. Hill, Richmond at-
torney. He was assisted by Martin
A. Martin, and Spotswood W. Rob-
inson, III, of Richmond, and W.
Simpson Tate, of Washington.

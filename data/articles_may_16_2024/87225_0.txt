We look upon this affair as a disgrace to the
Territory and the age in which we live; and
consider th men who perpetrated this outrage,
as much guilty of murder as though they had
shot the four men down in the publie highway.
It was a cold blooded and brutal affair, and
these self constituted hangmen have stained
their hands with human blood which no time
can wash out. There is never any excuse for
men taking the law into their own hands, and
administering justice independently of our civil
tribunals: and if the laws are to be set at defiance
in this manner, no person in the community
is safe, and the lives of our citizens are
subject to the caprice and hostility of lawless
men. To day a man may be lynched who is,
perhaps, guilty of crime: but to- morrow the
victim is innocent, but
may be some one who
has fallen under the displeasure of a perenal
enemy. There is no safety except in the laws;
and those who violate them, as in this instance,
are unworthy to live in a civilized community,
and had better take themselves to the savage
Indians, whose barbaritios they imitate. We
would like to find some excuse for this violation
of the law, if possible, but we cannot see
a shade of palliation. The men who commit-
solted the robbery were duly arrested and in the
hands of the law, and in a few days could have
been brought before the tribunal for
proper
for trial; hence there can be no execuse set up
that justice could not be obtained, and they
obliged to become midnight executioners
were in self defence.

A sheriff in Massachusetts warned
a mob of would- be lynchers that they
would be" shot down like rats" if they
attempted to enter the jail and seize
their victims. An official in Tennes-
see drew a dead line in front of the
jail, and served notice that the first
member of the lynching party to cross
the line would be shot. Several immediately
crossed and were shot
down, after which the deputies
charged and scattered the mob Yet
.,
always there are persons willing and
eager to be elected to the office
even of sheriff.

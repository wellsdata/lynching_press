CITIZENS PROTECT A NEGRO.
Brothers of a Young Woman He Tried to
Assault in a Posse Defending the Jail.
HAWKINSVILLE, Ga., July 23.- A peculiar reversal
of the order of things took place here
this morning. As if to repudiate the late lynchings
the citizens of Hawkinsville protected a
negro from death. At 1 o'clock this morning&
negro entered the residence of a wealthy farmer
near here, Mr. Samuel McAllister, and attempted
to assault his 16- year- old daughter.
The young woman's screams awoke Mrs. Mo-
Allister, and the negro was frightened off. He
was later captured and escorted to jail by a
crowd which repelled the attempt of a mob from
the country to lynch him. The Sheriff has
sworn in a large posse to protect the jail.
Prominent among the deputies who have
Bworn to defend the life are the two
brothers of the young woman negro's.

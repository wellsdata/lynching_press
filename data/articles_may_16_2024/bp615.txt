Southern Bosses Stirring Up
Race Passions And Lynching's
American Negro Labor Con-
gress Issues Statement Call-
ing For United Resistance
NEW YORK, May 8—(CNA)—Ac-
cusing the Southern planters and
other employers of labor of deliber.
ately stirring up the vilest race pas-
sions and the mob and lynch spirit
in their efforts to detract the work-
ers from their economic misery and
the reasons for unemployment and
its suffering, growing out of the eco-
nomic crisis, the extensive replac
ment of workers by machines, the in-
tensive speed-up of those kept at
work, etc, the Amèrican Negro
Labor Congress issued a statement
today calling for united resistance
on the part of Negro and white
workers "to these dastardly tactics
ofthe Southern bosses." The state-
ment follows in part:
"Adding two more to its long list
of working-class victims, Southern
white ruling class terrorism has
taken the lives of two more Negro
tollers. Two in one day! Dave Har
ris, brutally tortured and lynched in
Mississippi on April 23; Allen Green,
savagely murdered by a South Car>
lina mob on April 23.
"These two lynchings closely fol
low the mob murders of J. H. WII-
kins, pullman porter, in Georgia; of
Robert Burney, unemployed worker,
in Ohio; of Jimmie Levine, in Geor
gia; of Chester Fugate, white tenant
farmer, in Kentucky; of Laura
Woods, 65-year-old woman, in North
Carolina.
“These atrocious murders are not
isolated incidents, but are part of a
deliberate campaign of terror un-
leashed by the bosses against the
Negro toilers of the South.

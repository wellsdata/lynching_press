Wilmington, Del., June 27.- A week

entire police force on duty and 100 nat-

guardsmen are in

armory for duty. Captain Kane who is
in command of the police tonight said
that he did not look for further trouble.
The bitter feeling exhibited by the whites
and blacks against each other appears to
be rapidly disappearing. There has been
no clash of the races since Thursday
night.
While this is the condition of affairs tonight
, the pollee propose to keep in force
for a few days longer all the precautionary
measures they adopt this week What
is undoubtely the greatest factor in keeping
down disorder is the closing of the saloons
. An order similar to the one sent
out last night was again issued this afternoon
and every one of Wilmington's
180 saloons closed at 6 o'clock, to remain
closed until midnight Sunday or Monday
morning.
Mayor Fisher today sent out a suggestion
to the storekeepers to close their
places of business early tonight, but the
streets were crowded tonight with the
usual Saturday night shoppers. The
crowd was orderly.
There were no developments today directly
connected with the burning at the
stake of George White. It is generally
believed that the state and city authorities
will let the matter drop, as has been
suggested by some of the leading citizens.
A Wilmington evening newspaper today
quotes the Rev. M. B. Salter of Charles-
ton, S. C., a bishop of the A. M. E.
church, who is visiting in Wilmington,
as follows, with regard to the lynching of
White:
" We are willing to take off our coats,
mount our horses and ride into hell if
necessary to see that the law is carried
out if one of our race outrages a white
woman. We expect the white men to do
the same in case a similar crime is
mitted on our race by white men." com-

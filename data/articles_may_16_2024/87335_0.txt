AT A terrible affair has recently occurred
in St. Louis. As Mr. Joseph
Charless, one of the most prominent business
men of the city, and a member of
the firm of Charless& Blow, was quietly
walking the street, a man named Thorn-
ton, without a word of warning, stepped
up and shot him several times with a
pistol, inflicting wounds which must, ere
this, have proven fatal. The provocation
seems to have been an old affair. A
Bank of which Mr. Charless was Presi-
dent, was robbed several years since, and
Thornton, who was employed in the
house, was suspected. Mr. Charless appeared
against him as witness, but Thorn-
ton was not convicted. The late affair
has created a tremendous excitement, and
the military had to be called out to gaurd
the jail, to prevent the mob from lynch-
ing Thornton. He is in a tight place; as
a jury will in all probability hang him
or, if they should, a mob will attend
to his case. fail

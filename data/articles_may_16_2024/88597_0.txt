IDENTIFIED.
THE NEGRO
Darter Says Dock Reed As
Dorothy saulted Her.
27.- Dorothy
February
Indianapolis,
identified the negro, Doc Reed,
Darter
brought here from New Castle this afternoon
as her assailant. Last Thursday
afternoon on the streets of Irvington
she was assaulted and beaten into insensibility
. She is now in a dangerous condition
. After seeing a crowd of several
hundred around her home, the girl wavered
and said she was uncertain. Later,
when the negro and officers had left,
she stated that she positively identified
the man, but feared to say so when he
was there, fearing the crowd would
hang him in their yard.
When the news scattered that Reed had
been identified there was great excitement
throughout the city. A hasty consultation
between the Governor, adjutant
general, sheriff and superintendent of police
was called, and the companies of the
National Guard here were placed under
orders to be ready at a moment's notice
.
Fifty policemen are on guard on every
street in the vicinity of the jail, and
every one is stopped from approaching.
Groups of men appeared on every corner
near the jail, which is across the street
from the city police station. They were
dispersed. The negro was greatly fright
and kept imploring the officers in
the ened jail to save him.

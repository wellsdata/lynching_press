How Long Will Alabama
Submit to Mob Violence?
THREE
negroes lynched at the
state capital in twelve hours
is an ugly record. The third victim
I was shot to death in a hospital ward
where he had been taken after a battle
with a Montgomery policeman.
There is no sanctuary when a mob
is engaged in a man hunt, and the
law is a thing to be lightly brushed
as de.
Governor Kilby's announcement that
be
the full weight the
will
of his office
employed to bring members of the
Montgomery mobs to justice was to
have been expected from an executive
who acted with great promptness and
vigor in running down the Bay Minette
lynchers. The governor's efforts in
that case were so successful, thanks
to the assistance of former Attorney
General Horace Wilkinson and other
officials, that a precedent was broken
in Alabama- it might be said, in the
south. Members of a mob actually
arrested, convicted and punished for
their crime, the shooting to death in
jail of a murderer.
But the victim at Bay Minette was
a white man. It should never be said
that when a negro is lynched in Ala-
bama the authorities are any less vigilant
seeking his slayers than they
would in be if his skin were white.

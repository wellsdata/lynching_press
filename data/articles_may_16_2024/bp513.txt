Of the 47 victims, 42 were of the Race and five were white men. Among theị
former were four women, three lynched in Florida and one in Alabama, though
the last, the J. L. D. said, had not been confirmed from more than one source and
was never reported in the newspapers.
Lynchings occurred in 14 states, with Florida in the lead with eight, Georgia
second with seven, Alabama third with six, Louisiana, South Carolina and Ten-
nessee each recording five: Mississippi. three: California, two, and North Caro-

Forty-seven lynchings were reported in 1933, according to records kept by the
International Labor Defense. The number reported for 1932 by the League of
Struggle for Negro Rights was 37.
No person has been prose-"
cuted for any of these lynch-
ings, though four men were
arrested in Maryland for par-
ticipation, and immediately re-
leased, and in South Carolina
indictments were banded down

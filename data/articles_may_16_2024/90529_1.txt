speech.
Thursday.
A mob at Cairo, Ill., lynched two
men, one a negro, Will James, self- confessed
murderer, and the other Henry
Salzner, a white man, who admitted
that he had killed his wife.
A single robber killed the cashier
of a bank at New Albany, Ind., wounded
the president and a chauffeur, but
the bravery of the bank officials prevented
his securing any money, and
he caught in a motor boat chase
and was a lynching narrowly averted.

Admits Georgia Mob
Lynched Wrong Man
!
DARIEN, Ga., Sept. 26. â€” Willie
Bryant, who died in a Savannah hos-
pital on Sept. 9 from gunshot wounds
received at the hands of members of
a mob on the edge of a swamp near
here some time during the night of
Sept. 8, it was learned after his death
was not the man sought by the mob.
Bryant was not the companion of
George Grant, who was lynched in
the jail here on Sept. S for the slay-
ing of Tob Freeman, white police
chief, and the wounding of three
other officers in a gun battle.
"We are convinced that Bryant
was not the man with Grant when
he attempted to rob the Darien bank
and shot Special Officer Anderson."
stated Mayor R. A. Young. "Ander-
son has given us evidence that elimi-
nates the dead man as a suspect. We
want a man named Fred Bryant and
have wired police of other cities to he
the lookout for this man." the
mayor said.

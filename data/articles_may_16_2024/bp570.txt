Benjamin F. Hubert, head of the
State Industrial College of Savannah,
Grorgia, unluckily states in a public
speech that the Negro should returh
to the farms of the South. Immedi-
ately the Negro press heaps invec-
tives upon his deserving head.. One
paper flatly calls him għn “Uncle
Tom," thers, more charitably, call
no names, hat lay hare the enormous !
fallncy of his reasoning. DuBois in
the Crisis boldly calls hini a liar and
exposes the extent of the lie told.
Methinks Hubert will not quickly
again »ttempt to mislead his people
Into returning to the slavery and ter-
ror-ridden South, where he necrš-
sarily earns his livelihood from those
remaining.

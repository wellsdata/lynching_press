ELLICOTT CITY, Md., Sept. 16.-
While the Senate was marking time on
an anti- lynch bill in Washington, a
mob of whites was busily preparing to
lynch a man a few miles away in
Ellicott City, Md., Thursday night.
The man was Lawrence Wallace, a
farmer, lodged in the county jail on a
charge of shooting and wounding Chief
of Police Julius Wosch, white.
An armed mob of whites was first
on the scene with a long rope. Shortly
afterward an armed party of men who
were not white appeared on the scene.
They are said to have determined
to prevent a lynching. been

SPECTACULAR SUICIDE
[ ASSOCIATED PRESS DISPATCH]
PARIS, April 6.- Lacombe, the notorious
anarchist and bandit murder-
er, committed suicide today by jump-
ing from the roof of the prison De
La Sante. The leap was witnessed
prison officials, guards and by
by
Lacombe's lawyer, the prosecuting attorney
and the judge who committed
him to prison. These spectators were
summoned by telephone during the
two hours that Lacombe stood on the
edge of the roof, arguing with the
wardens who sought to persuade him
to return to his cell.
Lacombe was awaiting trial on the
charge of assassinating M. Dueret.

He was charged also with the mur-

daily hour of exercise he was watched
closely. Today while Lacombe
was talking to his lawyer in the en-
closed
courtyard inside the prison,
the guards stood F few yards off.
Lacombe. who was a professional
performer of feats of strength at

fairs, sprang

ladder leading to the upper part of
the building. He clambered past tier
after tier of cells and mounted swiftly
to the roof before the guards had
recovered from their astonishment.
Dozens of wardens passed through
the prison and on to the roof by trap
doors and were gradually surrounding
him on three sides. He threatened
to throw himself down and the
guards hesitated to approach. A
singular conversation then took place
between Lacombe, the examining
judge and the prosecuting attorney
who had been summoned. Magistrate
Driboux called on Lacombe to surrender

During his talk to his lawyer, prisoners

WANTED TO LYNCH A PRIEST.
He Had Swindled His Parishioners of
Thousands of Dollars.
Shamokin, Pa., Feb. 14.- Mount Carmel
contained a howling nob of Poles last
evening when Rev. Father Jakimowicz, the
deposed clergyman, was being conducted
from Justice Lewis' office to the depot
after having been committed to the Sun-
bury jail on the charge of enibezzling his
former parishioners' money to the amount
of nearly$ 10.000, and cries of" lynch him!
lynch bin!" were heard on all sides.
Jakimowicz had been a fugitive from
justice for some time and was captured
yesterday morning near Mahanoy City.
When the crowd surged about the prisoner
at Justice Lewis' office this evening the
officers in charge of Jakinowicz drew their
revolvers, and through fear of these alone
the mob was prevented from lynching the
prisoner.
Jakimowicz was committed in default
of heavy bail and on the way to the street
to board the train for Sunbury the officers
and their prisoner were followed by a
mob, who threatened to lynch the priest at
almost every step. It was only after the
most determined efforts of the policemen
that Jakimowicz was placed on the cars in
safety.
The prisoner was safely landed in Sun-
bury jail.
Fifteen other charges of embezzlement
will be preferred. One of his victims is
said to be a raving maniac in
of his loss. consequence

An entire Nation awaits the ex-
planation of the cause for the early
morning lynching of a 38-year-old
Negro, Caleb Hill, Jr. who was tak-
en from a jull-cell in the early
morning hours.
An Atlanta Daily World repre-
sentative Tuesday, following a ser-
les of Interviews with Negroes,
some of whom were witnesses at.
the disturbance and consequent en-
counter between HM and Sheriff
George Hatcher, shed new, light on
| several angles to the lynching epl-
sode.
:
World representatives examined
Hill's clothing Tuesday afternoon
and found strong indications from
the shoes he wore that he had been
dragged for a considerable distanco,
apparently along a cement road,
either before or after he was lynch-
ed. The shoes were found to have
been scraped severely..
A second important development,
hitherto unpublished, is the revela-
tion that at about 1:30 Monday
morning, Sheriff Hatcher, accom-'
panied by four uniformed state
highway patrolmen, a Chief of Po-
Hice and a deputy called at the
home of another Negro whom they
suspected of having possession of
the Sheriff's gun.
According to the statement of
the Negro and his wifo, ho was
beaten, his homo searched, and his´
wife suffered a wrenched ankle, The
Negro informant admitted, ⠀⠀ how-
ever, that he was in possession of
the Bhoriff's gun hha led them a
distance of about 50 yards from hla
house and secured it for the Shèriff,
7. Unlike the original report of 100
Negroes at the seat of the disturb-
ance, witnesses informed us that
there were about 10 and certainly
no more than 15 Negroe8,
The trouble took place, not at
Oleola's Place, but at the New Har-
tem Club, about two and one-half
miles below McIntyre.
Meanwhile, an. autopsy on Hill's
body was performed Tuesday after-
noon by Slater, a.Negro embalmer
at the Hooper's Funeral Home.
The autopsy was conducted in the
presence of Sheriff Hatcher, the
Ooroner, two stato Patrolmen, Two
bullets were found, one, lodged In
Hill's neck, and the other in his
forehead.
The death alugs wore turned over
to Sheriff Hatcher, who in turn,
gave them to Georgia Buregu offi-
cials for ballistics tests.
The post-mortem examination at
Toombsboro indicated that the
lynch victim was shot three times.
Several persons were questioned
Thesday but as yet no clues hava
been found to explain how Hill met
his death.

FROM THE COLORFUL 25-YEAR
HISTORY OF THE N. A. A. C. P.
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People was born out of the depair of Negroes and
the indignation of white people over the rising tide of lynching. Following the fiendish race riots in Springfield, Ill.,
in the summer of 1908, William English Walling, noted white writer, said in an article in the "Independent" for Sep-
tember 3, entitled "Race War in the North":
"Either the spirit of the abolitionists, of Lincoln
and Lovejoy must be revived and we must come to treat
the Negro on a plane of absolute political and social
equality, or Vardaman and Tillman will soon have trans-
ferred the race war to the North . . . The spirit of the
abolitionists must be revived."
Accordingly, Walling, a Southern white man, Dr. Henry
Moskowitz and Mary White Oving-
ton, with others, met in a small
New York City apartment in the
first week of 1909, and called a na-
tional
Lincoln's
conference
for
birthday, at which time the mount-
ing evils of disfranchisement, seg-
regation and-mob violencs were
discussed. With the assistances of
Oswald Garrison Villard, then pub-
lisher of the New York Evening
Post, another conference was ar
ranged for May 31-June 1. It was
attended by 1,000 people. A com-
mittee of forty was organized with
Miss Frances Blascoer (white) .as
secretary. During that year four
great mass meetings were held,
thousands of pamphlets distributed
and hundreds of members enrolled.
In May, P10, this committee be-
came the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored Peo-
ple, being ojined by the Niagara
Movement, a Negro, organization
formed in 1905. Moorfield Storey
of Boston was chosen president,
William English Walling, chairman
of the executive committee; John
E Milholland, treasurer; Oswald
Garrison Villard, disbursing treas-
urer; Frances Blascoer, secretary,
and W. E. B. DuBois, director of!
publicity and research. Offices were
opened in the Evening Post build-i
ing, at 20 Vesey street, New York.
First Steps Against Lynching
When the association was found-
ed there had been 3,284 lynchings
since 1882. During the ten years
from 1899 to 1908 incclusive, 959
| lynchings had occurred, 857 colored
and 102 white; 28 having been
burned, one a woman and two of
them children. Steps ware imme-
diately taken to fight the evil. It
was decided to raise a fund to in-
vestigate a lynching in some chosen
locality. Nearly $300 was immedi-
ately raised and by January 12,
1912, the fund had grown to $400.67
and investigation started.
The association became almost
immediately known nationally
through its investigations and its
publicity in magazines and news-
papers. When Robert Johnson, an
innocent Negro, was lynched at
Bluefield, W. Va., James Oppen-
heim, noted writer, volunteered his
services and wrote a graphic ac-
count of his investigation in The
Independent. When a white mob
invaded a hospital at Coatesville,
Pa, removed a Negro and burned
him, the association hired William
J. Burns, the famous detective, to
investigate the case.
In 1913, the association
gated six
Oklahoma,
and South
Dakota. It also obtain-
ed the introduction of an anti-
lynching bill into the Pennsylvania
legislature. The association experi-
enced considerable difficulty at this
time in getting favorable considera-
tion for its publicity and just treat-
ment of the Negro in the news. It
succeeded finally, however, in get-
ting over 100 daily newspapers to
change their position on lynching
and other topics concerning the
Negro.
As the association grew older,
the number of Its investigations In-
creased. In January, 1916, a spe-
cial agent was sent to investigate
the lynching and terrorism, which
had driven 2,500 Negroes out of
Dawson,
Cherokee
counties. Georgia.

Another agent
collected facts and photographs on
the burning of Jesse Washington,
May 16, at Waco, Texas.
A drive was started to raise a
fund of $10,000 to stage an anti-
lynching crusade. Fifty thousand
copies of the Waco Horror were
published as a supplement to The
Crisis and 38,000 coples distributed
at the expense of the association.
N. A. A. C. P, branches cooperated
magnificently. Over 10,000 appeals
were broadcast. In less than four
months the $10,000 was raised.
Investigations were also made
that year of the horrible lynching
of two women and three men at
Gainesville, Fla., and another at
Abbeville, 3. C.

The Nation Aroused
The tremendous growth in the
association's membership during
the war years of 1917 and 1918,
furnished it with the financial
means to make a more determined
fight against lynching. The 1918
lynching record totaled 63 Negroes
and four whites. A great number
of investigations were conducted
and nation-wide publicity was ob-
tained through the association's ef-
forts. A number of public officials
in the South, including sheriffs and
judges, took a determined stand
against mob-violence. The efforts
of the association aroused strong
and favorable editorial comment in
any southern newspapers and a
wave of press
condemnation of
throughout the nation. The
a Senate investigation of lynching.
At the same time Congressman
Leonidas C. Dyer introduced a bill
in the House of Representatives
making lynching a federal offense.
Through the efforts of the Ken-
tucky N. A. A. C. P. branches, an
anti-lynching law. was passed and
signed by the governor. A similar
law was enacted in West Virginia
and a more drastic one in Minne-
sota. Through the efforts of the
association the widow of Joe
Stewart, a Negro lynched at Lau-
rens, S. C., was awarded damages
of $2,000.
The long and determined fight of
the Association for a federal anti-
lynching law culminated in the
passage of the Dyer Bill in the
House of Representatives on Janu-
ary 26, 1922 by a vote of 230 to 119.
The national office with the full
support and cooperation of the
branches now pushed the fight on
every front for passage through
the Senate. Great publicity and
tremendous pressure was brought
to bear upon the senators from
every possible source. Despite these
efforts a combination of abandon-
ment of the bill-by Republican sen-
ators and a filibuster by southern
senators, the fight was lost.
Today, after a passage of teu
years in which lynching steadily
declined until the rise from 10 to
28 last year, the association is
again fighting for the passage of
an anti-lynching law. This time
the bill has been introduced in the
senate by Senators Costigan and
Wagner, and in the House of Rep-
resentatives by Congressman Thos,
Ford of California,
The Association did not confine
its agitation against the lynching
evil to the United States. It staged
demonstrations and parades with
stirring placards in London. It
sent lynching facts and figures to
England, France, Germany, Italy,
Russia, Japan, Sweden, Norway,
Finland and all Latin America, and
still does. Its news releases and
feature articles were published in
the newspapers of the entire world,
and still are. Through its persistent
and intelligent publicity the Crime
of America is known wherever men
read.
The Last Offensive
Most mportant of all, during
these intervening years, the atti-
tude of America toward lynching..
has undergone a profound change.
Southern editors, officials and lead-
ers who were mum or evasive a de-
cade or two back are now openly
in favor of drastic federal legisla-
tion to crush the evil. Many South-
erners have even written books
which have dealt scathingly with
the evil of lynch law.
In January, 1934, the Conference
of Southern White Women for the
Prevention of Lynchings passed
resolutions calling on President
Franklin D. Roosevelt to work with
governors to eradicate America's
disgrace. That this conference
really spoke for Southern white
women is evidenced by its mem-
bership of 1,000,000 white women
in eleven southern states.
one.
The Association feels that there
is more hope today than ever be
fore for the enactment of a drastia
federal anti-lynching law. Never-
theless, the fight will not be an easy
There is still strong opposi-
tion to such a law, particularly
from the unreconstructed South.
That the Association does not un-
derestimate this opposition and its
resourcefulness is evidenced by its
present effort to raise $5,000 to
lobby the Costigan - Wagner bill
through Congress. Clerical work,
investigations, transportation of
witnesses, telegrams and telephone
calls are expensive but vitally nee-
essary. The earnest, sincere and
enthusiastio support and co-opera
tion of far-sighted Negroes
whites are absolutely imperative if
victory is to be won.

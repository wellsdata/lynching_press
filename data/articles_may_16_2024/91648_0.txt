SENTENCES 6 MEN
SUPREME COURT
First Time in History Highest
Imposes Jail Terms
Tribunal for Contempt
Imprisonment of Chattanooga
Citizens Outcome of
Lynching Negro
WASHINGTON, Nov. 15.- For the first
time in American history six men are in
prison tonight for contempt of the supreme
court of the United States. For
the first time the federal government
has placed men behind the bars as an
outcome of the lynching of a negro.
At the United States jail here Captain
Joseph F. Shipp, former sheriff at
Chattanooga; Jeremiah Gibson, 76 years
old, jailer at Chattanooga, and Luther
Williams, Nick Nolan, Henry Padgett
and William Mayes of this city this afternoon
began to serve terms of imprisonment
imposed a few hours before by
the supreme court of the United States.
Shipp and Gibson had been found
guilty of failing to protect from a mob
Ed Johnson, whose legal execution had
been stayed by the supreme court until
it could review the case. The others
had been found guilty of participating
in the lynching of a federal prisoner.
Shipp, Williams and Nolan each were
sentenced to 90 days' imprisonment,
while Gibson, Padgett and Mayes each
received 60 days.
As the doors of the jail swung open
to receive the prisoners this afternoon
immediately after sentence had been
imposed Warden McKee stood before
them.
" At least, we are in the hands of a
soldier," exclaimed Captain Shipp, who
had been in many a fight for the confederacy
, as he spied a Grand Army
button on the lapel of Warden McKee's
coat.
Then, turning to his five fellow prisoners
, he said:
" Boys, it will be all right."
The
proceedings were practically
without precedent. In 1875 John Chiles,
a businessman of Texas, was brought
before the court for contempt in connection
with dealings in Texas indemnity
bonds, contrary an order of the
supreme court. He was to fined$ 250.

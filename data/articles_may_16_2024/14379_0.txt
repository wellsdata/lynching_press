LYNCHING LEAVES
DULUTH PEACEFUL
My United Presal
Duluth, Minn., June 16.- Duluth today
is quiet following the lynching
this morning of three negro roustabouts
who assaulted a young white
girl. The mob which did the lynching
dispersed soon after midnight,
leaving its victims hanging near police
headquarters.
The negroes hanged were roustabouts
with a circus, which is showing
today at Virginia, Minn. Eight
other circus negroes were arrested at
Virginia in connection with the assault
, but four were released. It was
feared the Duluth mob would go to
Virginia, and demand also that the
four be surrendered for immediate
hanging. Their assault of the young
white girl was on the circus
Monday night. grounds

CONVENES
SUPREME COURT
Washington, Oct. 4.- After a four
months' vacation the supreme court
of the United States convened today
for the term of 1909-1910. No official
business was transacted beyond
the admission of attorneys to the bar.
Tomorrow the call of the docket will
be begun and the presentation of arguments
in contested cases will be in
order. Associate Justice Mooidy is
not expected to be able to resume his
work on the bench this fall, being
confined to his home by illness, and
it is likely that Justice Harlan will
be prevented from setting on the
bench the greater part of the term,
as he also is in ill health.
A number of interesting cases are
on the docket for the present term.
Foremost in public interest are the
railroad rate cases. Another case of
interest is that of former Sheriff J.
F. Shipp of Chattanooga, Tenn., and
his five co- defendants, who have been
cited to appear before the supreme
tribunal to receive sentence for con
of court in connection with the
tempt lynching of the negro Johnson.

Fatal Shooting Affray.
Denver, January 28.- At 10 o'clock
this morning O. Kurtz, a mining boss,
was shot to death by Frank Williams,
and John Gray, miners. The shooting
grew out of a row at a dance last Monday
night at which time Williams was
,
ejected from the hall for disturbance.
This morning the parties met in a sa-
loon, and after a few words Williams
and his friend Gray drew their revolvers
and tired several shots at Kurtz,
killing him instantly. Both men have
been arrested and lodged in jail. The
excitement runs high and will undoubtedly
result in both being lynched
before morning.
A Rosita telegram says: Frank
Williams and John Gray, who shot andied
killed Orion Kurtz in a saloon row yesterday
morning were taken from jail at
2 o'clock this morning by a masked
mob and hanged to the rafters of a log
shanty near by.
Gray died game, but
Williams plead for mercy, saying that
he shot in self- defense.
The coroner's jury returned the
usual verdict," Hanging done by
parties unknown."
Eleven prisoners escaped from the
jail at Buena Vista yesterday, and have
not yet been apprehended. Henry
Ninemeyer, who last summer wounded
City Marshal Stingly, of Salida, and
killed his deputy, was among the
ber. num

RIOT AND LYNCH LAW. An abolition convention
, which assembled last week at Peoria
Ill. was broken up by the citizens, who dispersist
ed the members by pelting them with rotten
eggs. The next day, an Englishman, who
had attempted to commit a rape on a little
girl eight or nine years old, was caught, completely
covered with tar, and thus, with a rope
round his neck, was led through the streets.
He was afterwards, in condition, turned
loose, and turned out of that town.

A MAN SHOT BY A WOMAN!
We learn by passengers in the cars from
that something like
tragedy came near being enacted at that
place, about 11 o'clock, on Monday morn
ing. We could not learn the full details,
but the gist of the matter is about this. A
short time since a young lady of some 1
years, a Miss Merrill, ran off with a
man
whose name we did not hear, and was mar
to him at Aberdeen.opposite Maysville.
More recently, some difficulty having taken
place between the parties, the man stated
publicly that the marringe was a sham, and
east reflections on the character of his wife
.
Incensed thereat and burning with a desire
or revenge, the injured her
brother and brother- in- law to resent the
sult. Failing to comply with her wishes,
the resolute female took the matter in her
own hands. She procured pistols, and hav
ing familiarized herself with their use, she
osallied out in quest of her husband. Meeting
him on Main street, she drew the weapon
and placing it at his head pulled the trigger.
in her hurry and agitation she had only
half- cocked it, and it would not go off. In
properly
discharged, but the man ping fixed and
time turned round, the contents, consisting
of three buck shot, only grazed his arm and
back, inflicting flesh wounds without doing
any serious damage. Thinking she had
killed him, the lady gave herself in charge
of a magistrate, but soon ascertaining be
was only slightly hurt, she drew another
pistol and started after him agam. He had
employed his time to good advantage, hows
ever, and succeeded in making his escape
and secreting himself. The citizens of
Lexington were so incensed against him,
that order to avoid being lynched, he fled
the city in that night.- Lou. Cour. 9th inst.

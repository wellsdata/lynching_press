Kansas Mob -- Hanging of Mr. Day and
ST. LOUIS, March 2.- The St. Joseph correspondent
of the" Republican," under date of
the 27th ult., says that a special messenger from
Platte City brings the information that Mr. Day
and son, confined on the charge of running off
negroes, were taken from the jail, last night, by
a mob of three hundred men, and hung. The
reason assigned is, that the Court would acquit
the prisoners on the ground that it was not the
proper district to try them in.
The St. Joseph papers of the 28th ult. and
the 1st inst. contain nothing in reference to the
hanging of Mr. Day and his son, at Platte City,
by the mob. The story is, doubtless, an
mitigated hoax. un

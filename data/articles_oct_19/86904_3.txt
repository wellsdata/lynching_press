NOT A TILLMANITE.
From the Indianapolis News.
The Alabama sheriff, Kyle by name,
who successfully defended a. prisoner
against a mob that yesterday tried to
lynch him, evidently does not believe in
the Tillman doctrine. The man wanted
was charged with the crime which is
supposed to justify lynching. But Sheriff
Kyle realized that he was a public officer
charged with the duty of protecting all
the prisoners committed to his custody.
When a mob of fifty men broke into the
jail just before daylight, robbed him
while he was sleeping of his revolver and
demanded that he turn over the prisoner
he refused, though alone and unarmed,
to comply with the demand. Parleying
with the mob he managed to get a shot
gun, whereupon he told the mob it
would have to kill him before it could
get the prisoner. And so the affair ended.
That is the sort of sheriff to have. Mr.
Kyle by his action of yesterday made a
record for himself that will not soon be
forgotten. His name will be honored
wherever there is admiration for cool
and heroic performance of duty and
rverence for law as supreme over all the
people. How small Tillman seems alongside
of this brave man and faithful off
cer! The address of ex- Governor Jones,
the action of the constitutional convention
in regard to lynching, and now the
deed of this sheriff, have all reflected
honor on Alabama, and have done much
to blot out the shame of the recent horrible
burning of a negro in that State.
Kyle's example should be an inspiration
to sheriff's everywhere. Many a lynch
ing could have been prevented by the
show of a little determination by
sheriff. the

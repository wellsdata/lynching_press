URGES PUNISHMENT
OF LYNCHERS
New York, May 1.- The National
Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, through its secretary,
John R. Shillady of New York, makes
public a telegram to Governor Charles
H. Brough of Arkansas, urging an investigation
of the lynching of Sam
McIntyre, a Negro, on April 23, at
Forrest City, Ark., and the punishment
of the lynchers.
The attention of the governor is
called to the fact that the lynching of
McInyre is the twenty- first known
lynching since the signing of the armistice
and that all twenty- one occurred
in Southern states. The tele
gram urges action by the state authorities
and states that vigorous
prosecution of the lynchers of McIn-
tyre and adequate punishment of them
will do much towards preventing future
similar outbreaks and will show
that Arkansas does not stand
America for mob violence and lynching.

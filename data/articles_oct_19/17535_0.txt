A party of school- boys were playing foot- ball on
First street, when a negro picked up their ball,
and started off with it, in jest. One of the lads
threw a stone at the disturber of their sport, which
struck door of a painter
who rushed out with a gun, and fired, killing an
innocent and unoffending lad, about twelve years
of age, a son of Mr. John Wells, cooper, on Jefferson
street. Ogle was immediately arrested and
committed to jail, for trial before the criminal
court. Great excitement prevailed, and at one
time there was a disposition to invoke the summa
ry justice of lynch law." Ogle has borne a quar-
releome character and has previously threatened
,
to shoot those who displeased him He will prob-
ably plead" insanity.".

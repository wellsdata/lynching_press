and family near here, and whom a
posse has been trailing with dogs for
days, had been captured. The tele

The attempted assassination of the
Bloodworths aroused great indignation
and it has been openly stated all over
the surrounding country that the ne

is thought here, that, if the reported
capture is true, Morris has been lynch

effect has been received.
The chase of Morris has been one
of the longest and most persisetnt
Georgia has had in years. The chase
lasted ten days without a break.

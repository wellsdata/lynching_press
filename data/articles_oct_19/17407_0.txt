LYNCH LAW IN KANSAS.- The St. Louis
Republican of the 14th instant, says:
A gentleman from the Southern part of
Kansas informs us that one of those acts not
unusual in all the new territories of the West,
recently occurred on Pottawatomie creek, in
Kansas Territory. Various robberies had
been committed in that region- the people
turned out and apprehended two persons, who
were to
peaceable citizen, named Briscoe Davis, of all
his property, and the widow Cornett of$ 110
in cash, a horse, and all her property. After
due examination they were hung with the
ropes taken from the necks of the animals
stolen by them. One of the men thus hanged
by virtue of Lynch law, is supposed to have
borne the name of Partridge, and has been
quite a conspicuous character in that Territo-
y. The name of the other was not known.
These men, it is said, were hanged for robbery
and other crimes committed by them, and not
from any political consideration.
Gov. Geary should, if possible, relieve the
people of the Southern section of the territory
from the marauders who infest it, and who keep
the people in perpetual terror by their
ges. outra-

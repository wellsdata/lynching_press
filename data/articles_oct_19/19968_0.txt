BAKER CITY, April 11.- Company F,
O. N. G., are on the way to the scene of
the murder in Malheur county, and it is
expected will reach Vale in time to pre
vent the lynching of the prisoners in
custody of Sheriff Fell at that place.
These are John and William Bailey,
and Lee Mullen, murderers of Wil
liam Humbert, April 5th, while on
his way home from the democratic
primaries held at a little school house on
Bully creek flat that day. He was shot
and killed in the road, about a half mile
from his residence on Dry creek, between
Vale and Westfall. They had all been
attending the primaries, and during the
evening Humbert and John Bailey had
a quarrel about voting. Afterwards
Bailey was around the polls with his
arm cut, claiming that it was done by
Humbert. Humbert left for home in
the evening and had come to the hill
within sight of his house when John
Bailey, his brother William, and a young
man, Lee Mullen, who was hired by the
Bailey boys, overtook him. The Baileys
opened fire at close range, so close that
their victim was powder burned. Hum
bert was unarmed. He was shot four
times through the back and fell dead
from his horse. The Bailey brothers
were arrested that evening, and are now
in jail at Vale. Talk of lynching induced
Sheriff Fell to put a strong guard
in the jail. Nothing was done, however.
Af the coroner's inquest, the jury found
the killing had been done by the Bailey
brothers. Humbert's little daughter
saw the shooting and ran to her father,
but when she reached him he was dead.
Excitement runs high in that section
and strong threats of lynching are indulged
in by the cowboys. Sheriff Fell
is doing all in his power to protect the
prisoners and petitioned Gov. Pennoyer
to detail company F, at once. If the
cowboys, who are now organized, do not
carry their threats into execution before
militia arrives the murderers will be
the escorted to the city for safe keeping.
Lynching Certain Unless
the Militia
can Prevent it by Reaching
in Time. Vale

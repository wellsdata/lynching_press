The Bisbee incident has about
run itself out as a political issue.
After all the hullabaloo and noise
the whole matter settles down
to simply a mob of outraged citizens
rising up in their wrath and
ridding the community of a gang
of undesirable citizens. Mob
law under any circumstances is
always a violation of the statutes,
and is only justified when the
action of the courts is too slow.
A mob of citizens hung a brute
in Maricopa county a few months
ago which was contrary to law,
and on the same basis of the
Bisbee incident the actors should
be indicted and prosecuted. The
Bisbee affair differs because a lot
of partisan politics was injected
into it by the Gov. Hunt wing of
democracy which is builded
largely on sentimental criminology
, which believes law violators
should be the pampered pets
of society. The Bisbee deportation
was not an assault on organized
labor in any way, as
there were several thousand
miners in the Bisbee camp at
that time, and only 1100 of the
agitators, disturbers and loafers
were shipped out of the community
, which the thrifty, industrious
miners fully approved.
The labor agitator or disturber is
always a grafter, who is willing
to sell out labor to the employer
any time when the financial consideration
is sufficient. That is
the way he makes his living.
His following is the vicious criminal
element. That is the reason
there are 1100 men missing in
Bisbee, and the rest of the people
seem to be satisfied with
there existing conditions.

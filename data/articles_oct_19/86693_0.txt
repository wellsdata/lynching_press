NEEDLESS ALARM.
CAUSED BY THE REPORT OF A
MOB EARLY THIS
MORNING.
Sheriff Triplett and a Number
of Special Deputies Summoned
to Protect
the Jail.
About 1:30 o'clock this morning
Sheriff Triplett received a telephone
message at his residence stating that
a mob was gathering to attack the
jail and take ont Wiley Goode, the
.urderer of Frank Howe and
, lynch
him.
The Sheriff immediately telephoned
Constable Philpot and Chief of Police
Stewart, and together they came
down town, when the former sum-
moned about twenty- five citizens to
serve as special deputy sheriffs to de
attend the jail from the rumored assault
.
Mr. C. Voss was also called to his
store where the special deputies
were armed with twenty- five Win
chester rifles and two hundred
rounds of ammunition, after which
all repaired, thus armed, to the jail,
where
they remained on guard
throughout the balance of the night.
But no assault was made on the
jail. The Sheriff sent several coursee
iers out and in a short time they retent
turned and reported that they could
find only about a dozen balf- drunken
men who were talking about violence
.
The alarm was soon over and at
daylight the Sheriff and his deputies
returned in disgust to their homes.
The precaution of the Sheriff
against mob violence proved totally
unnecessary, but as" an ounce of
prevention is worth a pound of
cure," he acted wisely and well. Had
he not been on duty it is barely possible
that an assault might have
been made on the Jefferson
bastile. county

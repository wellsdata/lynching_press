A correspondent of the San Francisco Democratic
Iress give a description of the lynching
of five men at Los Angelas, by a mob. He
says:
When the prisoners had all been brought
out, the Committee started with its victims
to the place of execution, in front of the
jail, on the street. Here the crowd packed
densely around, the Committee ranged
itself in front of the galloows( which was a
beam running under the porch, of a house
fronting the street), and the first victim, Ell
Chase, ascended the platform, which was a
board over the a cart was
wheeled under the beam, the rope adjusted,
and the poor fellow, begging piteously for his
life, stepped on the plank. He had a few
words to say, and privilege was accorded him
to speak. The following, in broken sentences,
was the substance of his remarks:" Gentle
men, I hope to meet you all in a better world.
You ought to give us a trial. Is there no
mercy? I ask for meroy. May God forgive
me all my sins. Please tell me why I am to
hung. If you would give me a trial, I
be would die content.

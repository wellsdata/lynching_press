Monday evening about dark, Jeremiah
Coats, a colored man, working
on the Filhiol place on bayon De
Siard, was shot by some unknown par

a bucket of water, which be carried to
the house, and returning to the well

carried to the house, and returning to
the well for a whip which he bad for

doubt had just arrived and was wait

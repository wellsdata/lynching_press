Percy Hicks, colored, has been lodged
in jail for an attempted rape on the per
son of Ella, the little daughter of V. D.
Westerfield. The feeling against him is
quite bitter, and had it not been for the
fact that the matter was kept very
previous to his arrest, he would have quiet un
been lynched. This is the
doubtedly
third attempt of this character that has
taken place within the last few months
in this county, and the feeling is quite
high against the perpetrators. While
the writer is not an endorses or defender
of Judge Lynch, yet it seem that there
are times and circumstances which necessitate
prompt and forciable means of rid
ing the earth of these scavengers and
scoundlres who criminally assault help
less women and children. The working of
the law in many instances is too slow; in
others too many opportunites are offered
for delay, postponement, and final escape
from just punishment. All these conditions
create lynch law, and so long as
the negro fiends will persist in criminally
assaulting white women and children just
so long will there be lynchings. During
last year when several lynchings took
place in this State an officer of a humane
(?) society for the suppression of lynch
law, addressed a letter to our governor,
in which he asked why it was that lynch
law continued to exist in Mississippi
while in Ohio it was absolutely extinct.
To this the governor replied, in his personal
capacity, that a problem confronted
the State of Mississippi to which the State
of Ohio was a stranger. For this reply
Gov. McLaurin was raised higher in the
eyes of the writer. He voiced the united
sentiment of the white population of thirteen
states Z.

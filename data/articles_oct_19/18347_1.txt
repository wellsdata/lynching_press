OWENSBORO, Ky .. Dec. 17.- John
Rolla, the third of the negroes lynched,
was implicated by Rowland, one of the
negroes lynehed last night at Rockport,
in his confession, but denied his guilt.
He was guarded
by some determined
citizens, who had some doubts as to his
guilt He told
. conflicting
stories, and
it was learned that he was away from
the Veranda hotel, where he worked,
about the time Simons was murdered.
Confronted with this evidence, Rolla
weakened and confessed his share in the
crime, admitting that he struck the first
blow and that the two other
helped him to kill negroes

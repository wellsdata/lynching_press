Hatched at a Ball Game.
The plan for the lynching was hatched
at a ball game which took place at Hill
top, the scene of the murder, Friday after
noon. The lynching party met shortly
before midnight. All were masked and
about fifteen wore women's dresses. They
awoke an old colored man, Washington
Burch, who had charge of the jail. He the
made some show of resistance but finally
delivered over the
Cocking, who had been aroused by the
noise, was taken from the jail to a bridge,
200 yards away, where a rope with a noose
was placed around his neck and he was
told to confess, but he said that he was
innocent. Then he was directed to pray,
but said that he did not want to pray,
The rope was then made fast to the rail of
the bridge and the murderer was lifted to
the rail and pushed off. He fell ten feet.
The party then dispersed, leaving the
body dangling with the feet just
the water beneath the bridge. reaching

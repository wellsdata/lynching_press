ANOTHER LYNCHING AFFAIR.- The people of
California- at least that portion of it who regard
all evil doers with an abhorrent spirit-
have, as it were, spontaneously arisen, en masse,
repress
to past week from
ANOTHER LYNCHING AFFAIR- Monday, the
trial.
24th, two men, of very suspicious appearance,
entered the store of Messrs. Kettelle, Mahoney at
& Co., and one of them asked for Mr. J. C.
Bell, who was in the back part, for a light. He
gave him a light, and ordered him to go on the
outside to smoke. The man at first pretended
to be dronk, but after a while knocked up against
Mr. Bell, who struck him off. The other party
in the mean time was fumbling with the pota-
toes. Finding they could make nothing there,
they crossed over to Middleton& Hood's. Mr.
Bell's suspicions were strongly aroused, and he
watched the men closely. He went across the
street, and told the men who stood in front of
the store, to watch the two men. Presently
they came out, and Mr. Bell seized the man
and took him inside. On searching, they found
in his pockets a silk vest, a pocket book of jewelry
and a number of other articles, that were
recognized, as Mr. Middleton's property.

Three Negroes Lynched.
NEW YORK, April 30.- A special from Proctor, W.
Va., says:" The bodies of three negro√®s, brothers,
named Sylvester. were found hanging to a tree on the
roadside, six miles east of here, yesterday. Each
body bore a placard on which was written Nigger
thievery must be broken up.' The farmers in the
neighborhood have suffered depredations at the hands
of unknown persons, and it seems they finally settled
on the Sylvesters as the guilty ones. These negroes
lived in con.parative comfort yet scarcely ever did
any work. No arrests have been, made."

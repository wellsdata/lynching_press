" Raleigh" had some foundation for his charge:
We have uniformly endeavored to impress upon
our readers the deepest abhorrence of mob law, and
the imperative duty of every man to discountenance
it and to stand by the Constitution and laws of the
land at all hazards. There can be no other guaranty
of public or private rights -- no hope of liberty,
no assurance of the safety of life or property. The
feeling of this community, we are proud to say, entire
ly accords with this view of the subject. We are
a law- abiding people. So indeed has been the whole
State; but in some particular localities respect for
the law has been broken down by the incessant re
iteration, through an inconsiderate Press and by in
considerate persons, of lawless opinions. No people
are likely to retain their principle of respect for the
law who have it incessantly dinned into their ears
that such and such a person ought to be lynched,
hanged silenced, expelled,& c,& c., without judge
or jury,.

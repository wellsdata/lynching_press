Miss Morris.
Little Rock, Ark., August 10.- Five
negroes are hanging from the limbs of
trees near the railroad track, and the
widow of John T. Orr is dead in her
cell. This is the tragic denouement
of the assassination of John T. Orr, a
wealthy merchant at Clarendon a few
nights ago. The wife died from a dose
of poison self- administered, while
the negroes, her associates in crime,
were strung up by a mob of citizens.
The lynched are Manse Castle, Dennis
Ricard, Rilla Weaver, Susie
Jacobs and Will Saunders.
At mid- night a mob of 300 citizens
visited the Monroe county jail at Clar
endon, took therefrom the prisoners
charged with the murder of Orr and
lynched them. The mob was a most
orderly one, not a word being unnecessarily
spoken and not a shot being
fired.
They marched to the jail and demanded
the keys of Deputy Sheriff
Frank Milwee, who is in cvharge. He
at first refused their demands, but,
seeing their earnestness, turned over
to them the keys. A committee of the
mob went inside the jail and brought
out the prisoners and hanged them to
the tramway of the Halpern saw
mill, which stands about 100 yards in
the rear of the jail.
Will Sanders was the one who fired
the shot that killed Mr. Orr, Rilla
Weaver, was the mother of Sanders,
and cook in the Orr household; Den-
nis Ricard was the" hoodoo doctor
and conjurer" who tried to poison Orr
with boiled snake heads, and Manse
Castle volunteered to do the job and
transferred it to Sanders. Miss Rachael
Morris, accused of being an acces
sory before the fact, has disappeared
and her whereabouts are unknown to
the officers.
A placard bearing these words was
attached to the bodies-" This is the
penalty for murder and rape."
The negroes remained where they
were hung until 9 o'clock a. m. today.
Great crowds viewed the sight. The
negroes seem to endorse the lynching
and many of them are open in their
expression of satisfaction the
over
death of Dennis Ricard, whose arts
of hoodoo and conjuring made him
an object of dread to them.
While the five bodies swung in the
early morning breeze, the body of the
widow of the murdered man lies dead
in her cell in the county jail, with only
the soft sweet voice of her 3- year old
child to break the midnight silence of
gloomy cell, as the innocent little
the tot vainly cried for mamma.

BUFFALO, N.Y., Sept.6.- 4: 30 p.m-
This evening in the Temple of Music
President McKinley was shot twice
by an Anarchist during the reception
The man had a handkerchief wrapped
around his hand in which a pistol
was concealed. The first ball entered
the President's chest and glanced;

has been extracted.

called his secretary to his bedside
and is now dictating instructions
and his last wishes in case the wounding
should prove fatal. An immense
throng ran after the assassin, who
would have been lynched but for the
interference of police guards.
THE STORY OF THE CRIME.
BUFFALO, Sept. 6.- President McKinley
was holding a public reception
in the great Temple of Music on
the Pan- American grounds when the
cowardly attack was made, with
what success time alone can tell
.
Standing in the midst of crowds
numbering thousands, surrounded
by every evidence of good will,
pressed by a motley throng of people,
showered with expressions of love
and loyalty, besieged by multitudes
all eager to clasp his hand amid
,
these surroundings and with the
ever recurring plaudits of an admiring
army of sightseers ringing in his
ears, the blow of the assassin fell
and in an instant pleasure gave way
to pain, admiration to agony, folly
turned to fury and pandemonium
followed.
ASSASSIN'S REVOLVER CRACKS.
It was shortly after 4 p. m. when
one of the throng which surrounded
the Presidential party, a medium-
size man of ordinary appearance and
plain y dressed in black, approached
as if to greet the President. Both
Secretary Cortelyou and President
Milburn noticed that the man's hand
was swathed in a bandage or hand
kerchief.
Mr. McKinley smiled, bowed, and
extended his hand in that spirit of
geniality the American people so
well know, when Nieman thrust out
both his hands, brushed aside the
President's extended hand and
brought the revolver hidden in the
handkerchief up against the President's
stomach. At the same instant
he pulled the trigger. The first bul
let entored too high for the purpose
of the assassin, who fired again as
soon as his finger could move the
trigger. On receiving the first shot,
President McKinley lifted himself on
his toes with something of a gasp.
His movement caused the second
shot to enter just below the navel.
With the second shot the President
doubled slightly forward and then
sank back. Detective Geary caught
the President in his arms and President
Milburn helped to support him.
THE ASSAILANT SEIZED.
It had all happened in an instant,
Almost before the noise of the sec
ond shot sounded Nieman was seized
by S. R. Ireland, a United States
secret service man, who stood oppo
site the President. Ireland hurled
him to the floor, and as he fell a
negro waiter named John Harper
leaped upon him. In the confusion,
he was hustled to police headquarters
and securely jailed before he
could be intelligently located by the
angry mob of thousands, ready to
tear him limb from limb.
MCKINLEY'S FIRST THOUGHT FOR HIS
WIFE.
The President was assisted to a
chair. His face was very white, but
he made no outcry and sank back
with one hand holding his abdomen.
His eyes were open, and he was
clearly conscious of all that had
transpired. He looked up into President
Milburn's face and gasped
" Cortelyou." The President's secretary
bent over him." Cortelyou,"
said the President," my wife; be
careful about her. Don't let her
know."
Later, however, she was informed,
and stood the shock much better
than was expected.
AN OFFICIAL STATEMENT.
At 8:30 the representative of The
Associated Press was admitted to the
Milburn mansion, where Secretary
Cortelyou gave him this official bulletin
prepared by the physicians at
o'clock p. m .:

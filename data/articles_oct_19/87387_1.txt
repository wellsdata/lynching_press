ST. LOUIS, MO., Aug. 10.- A special from
Clarendon, Ark., says:
Mrs. John T. Orr, who hired a negro to
kill her husband, which act precipitated
the wholesale lynching here last night, and
who took poison in jail, died to- night at
8:45 o'clock. As soon as she was dead her
body was carried from the jail to her own
home, where her husband had met his
death, and shrouded by charitable hands.
Monday night she wrote a statement in
the nature of a will, which reads in part:
" I want my father to have my baby,
Neva, and to raise her. I want her to have
all of my effects. I want my body, if the
worst should come, to be shipped to my
father and to be buried where he is. I
hope God will forgive Rachael( meaning
Miss Rachael Morris) for the way she has
treated me. This statement completed at
6:30 p. m., Monday, August 8, 1898."

LYNCH LAW.- The Lawrenceburgh Republican
says it learns by a letter from Evansville, Ia., that the
most aggravated case of lynching occurred within ten
miles of that place, a few days since. The letter says:
" A merchant finding five hundred dollars less in his
safe than he left there, suspected the money was stolen by
a man who deposited that amount with him some months
since. He then proposed to his clerk to take him to an
island in the Ohio, and give him as many lashes as was
, required to produce a confession. The old man was tied
by his neck to a tree and received some five hundred lashes,
He bore it nobly, and told them to kill him, but that he
would never acknowledge himself a thief. He was proved
innocent by an alibi and the paid to him the second
, money
day after. Great excitement prevails. The guilty parties
higly respectable and can well afford to pay the high
are costs which their act of lynching will cost them."

MILITIA READY FOR MOBS.
Kentuck's Governor Aroused by the
Reign of Lawlessness.
Frankfort, Ky., Dec. 27.- Several companies
of the Second regiment, Kentucky
state guards, have been in readiness to
march for the past forty- eight hours. Gov.
Bradley is determined to prevent mob
violence if it is in his power, and the re
port that a mob would attempt to lynch
Johnson Howe,( colored) who is in Jall at
Paris, for the shooting of Policeman
Charles Lacy at Cynthiana, caused him to
order the militia to be in readiness to go
to Howe's protection. Lacy died this
. A telegram from Paris to- night
says morning that Howe is not in danger.

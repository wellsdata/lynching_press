When the coroner had heard the children's
story Wednesday night he ordered
Neise under arrest. It was not
long until the news spread abroad
and the sheriff heard such reliable
mob
rumors of 8 being formed
to lynch the man that they re
moved the prisoner. Neise had an insurance
policy on his wife's life for
$ 3,000. He acknowledged that he made
no effort to get his wife and child out of
the flames
, as it was too late..

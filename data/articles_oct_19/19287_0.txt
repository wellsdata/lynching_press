Two Negroes Lynched.
NEW ORLEANS, March 3.- A special
to the Picayune from Yazoo City,
Miss., gives the following account of
the lynching of two colored men at
at Sidon, Lefare county, last night.
Within the past two months two gin
houses, one cotton house, and more
than one hundred bales of cotton have
been burned in the neighborhood by
incendiary fires. Thomas and Terry
Mack, two notorious negroes, were ar
rested on Saturday, charged with the
crime, and were brought to trial before
a Justice of the Peace. At the
trial the evidence was so strongly
against them that the citizens became
infuriated, and last night a company
of nearly 100 masked men, white and
colored took the prisoners out and
hanged, them.

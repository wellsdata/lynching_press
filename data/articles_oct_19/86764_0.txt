There seems to be little doubt of the
lynching of the negro who murdered Dr. H.
J. Avinger in Cass county recently. He
was confined in the Linden jail, and when
Dr. Avinger died of his wound public sentis
ment was so strong against the perpetrator
of the heincus deed that it would not await
the process of the law, with its delays
and uncertainties slow.

Hiding Out From the Lynchers.
CHATTANOOGA. January 27 .-[ Special.]-
The body of Frank Dearmond, who was
brutally murdered at Hunter bluff, on the
Tennessee river, thirty miles above this city
on Monday night, was found a mile and a half
below where the murder was committed, this
morning, by dragging the river. He had
been killed with a shotgun, the charge taking
effect in his head and tearing all the back
part of the skull away. Two big stones were
tied to the body with a rope to weigh it down.
The finding of the body has created more excitement
than ever in the neighborhood where
Mr. Dearmond lives, and young Hunter, who
was arrested as the murderer, has been taken
to some unknown place to keep him
being lynched. from

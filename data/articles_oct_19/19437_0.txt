The fact that there have been no
lyuchings in this state the present
of
cannot be attributed to the
year
good, bad or indifferent administra-
praction of the governor. He had no safe
more to do with it than the man in sum
the moon, though we give the gover safe
to
nor the credit for this opposition to
his
lynch law. He would prevent it in
every instance if he could, but if he
ever heard of one until he saw it in
the newspapers he certainly kept it a all
profound secret. At Corinth preparations
were being made twenty- four
hours to lynch a nergo before the
event took place and the negro was
burned at the stake and the body,
what little was left of it, had become
cold and stiff before the governor
heard of the incident. But we are
not blaming the governor -- we only
- refer to it because some of his friends
are so extravagant with their asser
,
tions as to attempt to make it appear
that the governor's good administration
prevented a single lynch
ing in the has state for 1903.

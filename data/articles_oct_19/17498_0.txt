Speaks on Boycott.
Prof. Charles Cheney Hyde of Columbia
University spoke on:" The Boycott
as a Sanction of International Law."
Speaking of the necessity for establish
ment of a violation by an offending
state of international law before some
impartial arbitral tribunal, he said:
" Until it is established in some im
partial and convincing way, as by re
course to an arbitral tribunal, the in
tering states can hardly claim to be
vindicators of the law. This is true
when, acting upon their bare indictment
of a neighbor, they unleash the boycott
against it. If their conclusion is wrong,
the action amounts to sheer lawlessness.
If it is right, they are not unlike the
mob that lynches the murderer
its grip. within

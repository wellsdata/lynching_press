A Colored Preacher Lynched.
YELLVILLE, Ark., June 28.- Sam
Stokely, a colored preacher, was found
hanging to the limb of an oak with a note
pinned to his breast stating that he had
been too free with certain women living
on Mason's plantation, and this, his end,
would be repeated to others if more care
was not exercised. This arouses much
feeling, as it slanders an eminent
on the Mason place. family

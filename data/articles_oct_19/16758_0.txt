Atlanta Constitution.- The assault of the lowest
criminal upon the life, person or property of another
affects directly but two person, the assailant and his
victim, that act of the mob which lynched Leo Frank
has put a stain upon the escutcheon of the State which
more than 2,500,000 people are trying to preserve un
tarnished. Every man, woman and child in George
will feel the ultimate effect of that act of the law- de
mob which lynched not Leo Frank, who is only
tying a detail in the lawful story; but the State itself.

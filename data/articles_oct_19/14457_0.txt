DALLAS, Texas, March 3.- Torn
from the very grasp of the law by
members of a mob of 5000 today, Allen
Brooks, an aged negro, charged with
assaulting a three- year- old
criminally white child, was hanged for his crime.
Brooks was seized in the court room,
where he was to be tried, and tossed
through a window to the main body of
the mob which waited in the street
below.
His broken body was dragged
through the streets and he was hanged
near the Elks' arch. The mob was
led by an old negro.
Hardly a word was spoken and not
a shot was fired. The loudest sound

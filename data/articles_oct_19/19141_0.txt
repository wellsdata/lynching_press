MILITIA AND THE LAW.
Maryland has shown that it does
not intend to be diegraced by the acts
of a crowd of hotheads bent upon
lynching some men as used of a
crime who are entitled under the
Constitution to a fair trial and the
presumption of innocence until found
guilty. The dispatch by the Governor
of the state of the militia to
Chestertown was at the instance of
the chief judge and the bringing of
the accused men to this city was on
an act of precaution against un
ly necessary public perturbation.

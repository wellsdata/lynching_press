Boy Murderer Lynched in Minnesota.
PERHAM, Minn., June 9.
John Tribbetts, the boy who murdered
Washington and Feherbach a few days ago,
was brought here yesterday and examined
before Justice Rothpleth. Towards night
the propriety of lynching him was freely dis
cussed, but nothing was done. About 1 this
morning twenty resolute men broke into the
jail with great difficulty, and grasped him.
He said," don't boys, this is ton rough." The
lynchers then carried him to the railroad
track a few rods away and hung him from
the top of a pole. The lynchers kept the
crowd beck with revolvers and as soon as
the work was done scattered. Tribbetts,
who is only seventeen years old, made a full
confession last evening. He laughed at the
crowd that met him yesterday morning, but
became depressed at night. The
will not probably suffer for their crime lynchere.

door, took Charles F. Woodard out of
his bed and hanged him on the gallows
which was built for his legal execution.
NO TIME TO DRESS.
The trembling wretch was awakened
from a sound sleep by the mob's en
trance to the jail. He was not given
time to dress himself, but was taken
out in two inches of snow with nothing
on his person but a short shirt. He
made no outery or resistance when he
saw the masked men, who had handkerchiefs
tied over their faces, but went
quietly with them.

MAKES BRIEF ADDRESS.
" Boys, let me kneel down and pray
for you; I want to pray for all of you.
These are the last words to my blessed
little wife. Tell my dear little wife that
I loved her dearly, won't you. Tell her
that, boys, I pray that you have the
papers print it. God forgive me for my
sins. I pray for myself
and I pray for
you, and I pray for Charley Ricker.
I never had any grudge against him in
God's world."
A voice cried out," Why did you shoot
him, then?"
" DON'T CHOKE ME, BOYS."
" I never meant to shoot him," said
Woodard." Don't choke me, boys; for
God's sake, you are choking me- don't
choke me to death. Oh, God! have
mercy on my soul and I pray for my
blessed little wife. Don't choke me to
death, boys -- you are choking me. Please
don't chcke me. I did not shoot Charley
Ricker on purpose. Lord have mercy
on me and my dear little wife."
The naked and trembling man, with
the rope tightly drawn about his neck,
was then shoved off the trap, but he
gave a spring off from it before the
lever could be pulled, and in making
the jump he slipped and fell off the
north side of the gallows, his bare legs
scraping along the platform.
HORRIBLE SCENE OCCURS.
The body commenced to go through
terrible contortions, and a couple of
masked men caught hold of his feet and
gave them several hard jerks. They
then drew the body toward the north

back and struck the framework of the
gallows.

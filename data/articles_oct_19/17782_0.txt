THERMOPOLIS ROBBER
JUST ESCAPED LYNCHING.
Themopolis, Wyo., Nov. 17.- For a
time last night the bandit captured by
Deputy Sheriffs Hanna and Edwards
for robbing the Edwards' saloon here
was danger of being executed
by the indignant citizens of this
place. A large crowd gathered and
the lynching of the robber was freely
discussed, but finally the crowd gave
up its plan for want of a leader.
The bandit will be taken to Basin for
trial. He will be accompanied by a
strong posse, as it is feared an attempt
may be made by his friends to rescue
him during the trip across the Owl
Creek mountains. There is no further
danger of mob violence.
The robber is unknown here, and is
believed to have been induced to at
tempt the Thermopolis crime by the
success of the Cody robbers in escaping
. It is believed possibly he is one
of the pair who shot Cashier Middaugh
in the Cody bank.
posse is still on the trail of the
brother A bandit.

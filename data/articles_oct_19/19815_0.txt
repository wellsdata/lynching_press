The Springfield Riots.
Almost within the shadow of the
shaft under which lie the bones of the
Great Emancipator, there is going on
what, from the press reports, seems to
be one of the most dangerous and determined
outbreaks of race warfare that
the country, North or South, has known
Murders, assaults, arson, rioting, robberies
, wrecking of homes, and looting
of shops- these have been the incidents
in this outbreak of natred and prejudice
. A series of crimes which were
laid at the door of the blacks led to
the formation of a mob determined to
lynch two suspects. The sheriff hurried
them away in a fast auto, and to
jail in another town.
Then the mob's fury turned to the
blacks in general. Every house in the
negro section of the city, it is stated,
was burned. The fireraen's hose was
cut when effort was made to extinguish
the flames. Trying to escape, or fight
ing to defend their property, the blacks
were shot and beaten; and the death
list of five with more than a half- hundred
wounded is likely to prove incomplete
..
It has been a repetition in all es-
sentials of every other similar riot.
There seems to no fiercer hared
than race antagonism be when its pas on

Since I last wrote to you, the affairs of
this country have been constantly get
ting worse. We have nolgovernment here,
either civil or military, and the country
is full of lawless men who are committing
the most shocking outrages.- Murders
and robberies are of daily, and I might
almost say of hourly occurrence. Not an
arrival occurs from the North, South, or
the interior, but notifies the community
of new acts of villainy which go unpunished
. Within six weeks more than
twenty murders have occurred in a white
population of less than 15,000 souls. The
people are now acting in self- defence;
and four or five days since, 3 men were
hung by Lynch law, sixty miles from this
place. It is of the last importance that
the distressing condition of California
should be impressed upon those at Washington
who have the power to apply a
remedy. The people are now trying to
organize a provisional government.***
but should Congress give us a territorial
organization at the present session, it will
supercede the popular local organization
now taking place, but which cannot go
into effect before the ensuing summer.
The United States revenue laws are now
in force here, and will yield an income
of say$ 450,000 the ensuing year, and
perhaps more, and four- fifths of this a
mount will be collected at this port
.
Much dissatisfaction exists at the
payment
of such a tax on the part of the inhabitants,
without either government or representation
. This feeling is gaining
from day to day. ground

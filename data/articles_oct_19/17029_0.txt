Robbery and Lynch Law.
BATON ROUGE, July 12- A robbery took
lace on board the steamboat Chancellor last
night. Several men, deck and cabin passen-
gere, lost amounts varying from$ 15 to$ 60 in
pocash, and drafts as high as$ 1400.
Some of the deck passengers were suspect
ed of the act. The cabin passengers held a
court and examined several of these persons.
All the stories were conflicting, and nothing
satisfactory was elicited. None of the missing
money was found except the upper part of a
bill of exchange for$ 1476, drawn by Messrs.
Perkins, Campbell& Co., of New Orleans.
Five of the men arrested were condemned
by a verdict of the passengers to be severely
whipped, and the sentence was carried into effect
. Two the five had their backs horribly
lacerated by of former floggings.

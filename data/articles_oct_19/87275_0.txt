POWESHIEK MURDERER LYNCHED.- The
person who was under arrest, on a charge
of having perpetrated the cold- blooded
murder in Poweshiek county, a few months
since, was yesterday taken out of the hands
of the Sheriff and deliberately hung by
a mob of 400 citizens. A change of venue
had been asked for and granted. The
granting of this application by Judge Stone
was the signal for the seizure of the prisoner
, and his execution in the immediate
vicinity of the town of Montezuma. The
citizens, generally, male and female,
looked on approvingly, at the butchering
of the miserable culprit. The facts are
communicated by the Sheriff of Poweshiek,
who passed through this city this
noon.- Iowa City Republican. after

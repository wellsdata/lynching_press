FROM LYNCHERS
MISCREANT NEGROES HURRIED
TO CELL FOR SAFETY.
COUNCIL BLUFFS TROUBLE
Citizens of lowa Wrought to High
Pitch by Repeated Assaults on
Women and Prisoners' Safety from
Lawlessness Demands Removal to
Strong Walls of Penitentiary.
Council Bl uffs, Dec. 30.- Neely
Zimmerman and George Burk, the negroes
who Monday night narrowly es
himcaped lynching, were last night taken
to the penitentiary at Fort Madison,
Iowa, for safe keeping. During the
afternoon the men were taken before
Judge Wheeler and waived pr√©limin
ary examination. The judge then
signed an order for their removal and
the men were immediately taken to
Fort Madison.
During te day the company militia
guarded the jail and arrangements
were made for a heavy force of police
to assist, should another attempt at
lynching be made.
Four assaults within a week, similar
to those made on Mrs. Sparks and
daughter, had wrought up the people
to the pitch of feverish excitement and
this feeling was freely voiced on every
street corner. Monday night's experiences
and yesterday's developments
were suficient to lead the authorities
to the belief that an attempt would be
made last night by a well organized
mob to lynch the negroes and they decided
to avoid all trouble by removing
the cause for repetition of the 3
turbance. a

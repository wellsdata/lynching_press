The worst rioting in the fortnight
of the Lawrence, Mass., textile
strike, involving 20,000 persons,
occurred when street cars were held
up and stoned by mobs which refused
to let operatives go into the mills.
One woman was struck and killed
by a stray bullet, a patrolman was
stabbed in the back, a militia captain
I was badly cut by a brick and several
others hurt by stones as well as by
the clubs of the police and militia.
Governor Foss ordered twelve additional
companies of infantry and two
cavalry troops to proceed at once to
Lawrence reinforce the nine companies
already to there.

A Double Lynching.
CHARLOTTE, N. C .. Sept. 12 .-- A
special to The Chronicle says that
Frank Stack, a white man, and Dave
Boone, colored, were lynched at Mor
gantown, Burke county, about 2 o'clock
yesterday morning, by a mob of some
150 men, who overpowered the jailor
and broke open the prisoners' cells.
Stack was in jail on the charge of shooting
Robert Parker last August, and
Boone was charged with killing Eli
Holder, a white man, at a camp meeting
ground, about two weeks ago. It is
said that Boone confessed, but that
Stack protested his innocence to the
last. The jailor claims to have rec g:
nized three of the lynching party, aut
warrants have been issued for their
rest. ar-

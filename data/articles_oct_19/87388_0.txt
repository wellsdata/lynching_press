Is Attorney General Ketcham
of Indiana.
SORE OVER HIS FAILURE
To Convict Hezekiah Hughes on the
Charge of Lynching the Five Out
laws at Versailles Last
September.
Indianapolis, March 4. 1 Attorney
General Ketcham returned from Ripley
county, where he failed in an attempt
to have Hez Hughes held by the grand
jury as one of the mob that lynched the
five members of the Levi gang at Ver-
sailles last September.
Ketcham was greatly disappointed at
the outcome, and made a sarcastic re
port to Governor Mount, in which he
says that, from all the evidence offer
ed, he believes that Levi broke out of
the jail on the night in question while
everybody in Ripley county was asleep,
stole a revolver, broke back into jail,
shot himself dead, then killed his four
companions, broke back into jail,
dragged out the four corpses, strung
them up to the trees where they were
found, and then hanged himself, al
though he was already dead.
He closes by saying that the people
in Ripley county are above any suspicion
, and offering to prove to the governor
that his theory of the affair
correct. is

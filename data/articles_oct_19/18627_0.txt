Faye His Assault Was in Self- Defense.
PALMER, Mass., July 28.- The negro who
assaulted S. Wilson Lawrence on Wednesduction
day was captured last evening at Gilbert
ville. He gives his name as Charles G.
Fields and his residence at no particular
place, but lately on the California coast.
Fields says his action on Wednesday was
in self- defense; that Lawrence found faul:
with his work; words followed, and
finaily Lawrence ordered him to leave,
emphasizing the order by attacking him
with a pitchfork. Fields says he stum
bied over a rock, which he picked up and
used to defend himself with. The 3) shot
which Fields received in his left side
bethered him a great deal, and he was
several times on the point of giving him
self up, but he heard guns fired, and
thought he might be lynched if he surrendered
. Mr. Lawrence is improving, and
hopes are entertained of his recovery.
Those who know Mr. Lawrence do
believe that he first assaulted the negro not.

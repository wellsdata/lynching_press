ENOUGH OF LAWLESSNESS.
Two wrongs do not make one right
nor does the violation of the law committed
in the murder of Conductor
Flury justify another violation of the
law in mob vengeance on his assailants.
It is to be hoped that despite all
provocation, the talk of lynching and
mob violence, which has been prevalent
in this community for several days and
culminated with the news of Flury's
death, will be forthwith abandoned for
the determination that the law shall
its regular course in dealing with
have the criminals.

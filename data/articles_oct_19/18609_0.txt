A Tennessee lynching of a negro this
week was found by the participants to be
such an enjoyable occasion, that they
insisted taking fingers ears and
upon,
,
other members from the victim, while
allve, just for souvenirs; and yet Tennes-
see claims to be civilized! The Gover
of that state is right in forbidding
nor prize fighting.

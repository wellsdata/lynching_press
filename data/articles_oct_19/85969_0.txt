is no language which can con-

outrage," declared Former Governor
Slaton of Georgia, at his
hotel here this morning, when
told that mob rule had been
responsible for Leo Frank's
execution.
" The abduction of Frank was
a cowardly attack upon civilization
," continued Governor
Slaton." And I know the people
of Georgia well enough to
say without qualification that
the Entire State will resent
this outrage, and that nothing
will be left undone to punish

the horror of it all that I findern

Gov. Slaton branded Frank's
lynching as a deep blot on his
State." The act is a consum-

+ every man engaged in the
lynching should be hanged,
for he is an assassin. Such an

of Georgia, and one
which every good citizen will
condemn."

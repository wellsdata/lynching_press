Negro Stealing in Texas.
The following extract of a letter which we
received by the last mail, dated La Grange, July
29, gives rather a doleful picture of affairs on
the Colorado:
" I have just returned, after an absence of
five weeks, from your State, in Caddo, De So
to and Sabine Parishes, in pursuit of some negroes
that were stolen from Dr. Adkins in 1847.
was in hold of a negro man
and in bringing him home safe. What caused
me to go in pursuit of him, was the fact that a
man was caught in the act of stealing negroes,
when he made a full confession, implicating
many of our most respectable citizens. We
are in a state of great excitement, and what is
to be the end of it God only knows; but I tell
you there will be serious work here, for we are
determined to rid the country of all such clans
-and we have made a very good start; we have
hung seven or eight already, and expect to hang
a great many more." Lynch Law" is our mot
to, for it is useless to troubie the law with them,
for nothing could be proved. It is another
" Murrell clan" precisely. I was in great dan
ger while absent, as I understand that two ne
gro rogues started in pursuit of me, but by
some chance they missed me. My friends were
uneasy respecting my safety, and were very
the
negro, which created great excitement, as one
of our citizens stole and sold him, and has since
been hung. We go by the name of Regulators
, and are some two hundred strong in this
county the same excitement prevails in the ad-
joining; counties."

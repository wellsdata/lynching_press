GEORGIA TIES LOUISIANA
NE can well imagine what glee
ONE fills the breast of the kaiser as he
reads of America's blood- red record of
Negro lynchings. Four more Colored
Americans, three men and one wo
man, accused of the murder of a white
farmer, were murdered by a Georgia
mob this week. Georgia now
Louisiana in this gruesome Southern
sport, both states scoring eleven victims
within the past fourteen months.
This makes a total of fifty lynchings
within the confines of the United
States since America's entrance into
the war" to make the world safe for
democracy. What an appalling rec
crd!"

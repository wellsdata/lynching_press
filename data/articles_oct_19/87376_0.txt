THE NEGRO LYNCHED.
Charlottesville, July 12.- Henry
James, the negro who criminally assaulted
Miss Julia Hotopp yesterday.
was lynched at 11:30 o'clock this morn
ing about three miles west of this city
by an armed mob of one hundred and
fifty people.
As the train reached the Woods
crossing, with revolvers drawn, the
mob mounted the car.
Farish, the chief- of- police, held the
door, but he was swept aside and
bound around the wrists.
Sheriff Watts, who was in posession
of the prisoner, drew a revolver but he
was soon overpo vered.
The negro was taken about fifty
yards away from the train and a rope
that had been passed around his neck
was thrown over the limb of a locust
tree.
He was given time to pray and he
declared his innocence.
The body was then drawn up and
forty or fifty shots fired into it, com-
pletely riddling the dangling body.
Carl Hotopp, brother of the young
la ly who was the brute's intended
victim, arrived on the scene ten min-
utes after the hanging and emptied
his revolver into the dead and mangled
body of the would- be rapist.
The news of the lynching spread
like wildfire throughout the city and
hundreds of persons visited the scene
of the tragedy.
At 2 o'clock this afternoon the body
was still hanging to the tree.
The grand jury was in session when
the news of the hanging reached the
city.

on the streets until midnight last

Staunton.
At midnight last night a special
train from Charlottesvi'l brought the
prisoner to Staunton to escape the
vengeance of the Charlottesville mob.
He was lodged in jail at Staunton and
taken back back to Charlottesville on
the 10:20 train this morning.
The following account of the attempt
is from the Charlottesville Progress:
The city was shocked this morning
by the inteligence that Miss Julia
Ho: opp, daughter of the la'e William
Hotopp, had been criminally assaulted
by a negro, near the gate of Pen Park.
Pen Park is situated about two and
half miles east of Charlottesville, and
is approached by the Earlysville road.
Just beyond Cochran's mill the road
turns to the right through a boddy of
woods, perhaps a half mile wide, to
the gate of the farm, which is a quarter
of a mile from the residence. The
point is quite secluded.
The particulars, as learned from the
young lady herself, are about as fol
lows:
She came to the city between 8 and
o'clock this morning to have her rid
ing horse shod. On her return she
found the gate, which is usually fastened
by a latch, securely bound with a
wire. Surprised at this, she looked
around for the farm hands, supposing
there must be some good cause for
fastening the gate thus, but seeing no
one she dismounted and unloosed the
gate herself. As she turned to re
mount, someone approached her from
behiad and struck her, and then grasp
ed her by the neck, forcing her to the
ground, when she became unconscious.
When she returned to consciousness,
about 10 o'clock, she looked around but
saw no one, and her horse had gone to
the house, several Lundred yards furth-
er on. The horse returning without
the rider startled her brother, Carl
Hotopp, who hastened toward the gate, AN
meeting his sister coming. Upon
meeting her brother she swooned
again.
After arriving at the house she again
returned to consciousness and told
what had befallen her. She describid ung
her assaillant as a very black man, tour
heavy set, slight mustache, wore dark will
clothes, and his toes were sticking out
of his shoes. them
After this releation Miss
Hotopp again became urconscious, he

by several physicians, at last accounts.
When the fact became known in the great
city, the indignation was exceedingly as
great, and numbers started out in

vehicles, on wheels and afoot. and

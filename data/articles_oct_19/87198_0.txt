LYNCH- LAW IN PAGE.
INHUMAN CRUELTY, MURDER, AND RETRIBU
TIVE JUSTICE IN PAGE COUNTY- A NEGRO
LYNCHED FOR THE MURDER OF A CHILD.
Through a gentleman who reached Staunton
yesterday evening from Page county, we have
the following particulars of a fearful crime
committed in that county last week, near Ce
dar Grove.
A negro man, said to be from Nelson county,
name not remembered, took with him one
morning last week a white child, aged two years
and eleven months, and, for some cause un-
known, whipped him most unmercifully and
left him for dead, but, finding that he was not,
took the helpless child and held him in a stream
until life was extinct and then fled.
When the child was missed, search for him
was instituted by the parents and neighbors
and its dead body found in the stream, and on
it could be counted the marks of two hundred
and sixty strokes.
The neighbors immediately started in pur
suit of the negro, who had fled, and when overtaken
hid himself in some bushes, but being
fired upon, he ran and jumped into the river,
and a ball grazing his head he swam back to
shore and surrendered himself.
He was taken before a magistrate and sent
on for indictment, but that same night,( last
Thursday) he was taken by a mob and hanged
to a sapling about a mile from Cedar Grove.
His body was still hanging on last Saturday,
and was seen by our informant as he passed on
that morning. A coroner's jury was summon
ed to investigate the case, but we have not, as
yet, heard any particulars thah as above
given. further

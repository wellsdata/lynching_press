-
Houston, Tex., June 22.- Last night
nine negroes met death at the hands
of a mob in the vicinity of Hemphill,
in Sabine county. Today both races
secured arms and the tension is such
tonight that a race clash seems imminent
. The dead:
JERRY EVANS, aged 22.
WILL JOHNSON, aged 24.
MOSE SPELLMAN, aged 24.
CLEVELAND WILLIAMS, aged 27.
WILLIAM MANUEL, aged 25.
FRANK WILLIAMS, aged 22.
TWO UNKNOWN MEN.
WILLIAM M'COY.
All the dead are negroes. The
lynching followed the killing of two
white men by negroes. Two weeks
ago Hugh Dean and several other
white men visited the negro church
and schoolhouse where a dance was
in progress, presumably in quest of
liquor, it being the custom of some
of the negroes to sell whisky during
the progress of such an affair.
Cause of the Trouble.
During the evening Dean was killed
and six negroes were held for the
killing. At the preliminary examina
He tion the evidence tended to show that
the plot was formed at the dance to
kill Dean.
Saturday last Aaron M. Johnson, a
prominent farmer, was assassinated
while seated at the dining table with
his wife and child, the bullet being
fired through a window. For this
vice crime Perry Price, a negro, was ar
. rested, and it is stated confessed, im
re- plicating Robert White, a relative of
one of the negroes held for Dean's
Cin- murder. Price declared he was offered
$ 5 to kill Johnson.
On The followed the forming of a mob
of last night, the overpowering of the
of jaller at Hemphill and the lynching of
Sun- the six negroes held for the murder
of Dean. Five were hanged to the
same tree while another who attempt
to- ed to escape was shot to death. Later
Im- in the night William McCoy, another
take negro, was killed while
shot and
standing at the gate of the Johnson
home, and this morning the bodies of
two more negroes were found in the
creek bottom. Wright, the negro who
Mr. confessed to killing Johnson, and the
.
implicated were taken to

pa
Beaumont for safekeeping under
be
guard of the military company of San

un
most remote part of the eastern sec

" DRYWAR LEADS TO LYNCHING
ANTI- SALOON, DETECTIVE HANGED
FOR KILLING MAN.
Mob Storms Jall at Newark, O., Gets
Prisoner and Strings Him
Up.
Newark, O.- Battering down the
doors of the jail, a mob of women,
men and children Friday took Charles
Etherington, an anti- saloon detective,
who confessed to having killed a man
here, and lynched him in the public
square.
The mob which had been increasing
all evening at the jail became frenzied
and refused to listen to pleadings for
preservation of order.
They broke all the jail windows and
rammed in the outer door, taking the
keys from the jailer. They quickly
found the prisoner's cell on the second
floor and then, dragged by a rope, the
man was taken up Third street to the
spare and across the park to the
southeast corner, where he was
strung up over the arm of a telephone
pole.
Gov. Harmon arrived in the city Sun
day and began an investigation which
may lead to the ouster of the sheriff
and Mayor.
The shooting of Howard and the
lynching of Etherington is the culmination
of long standing trouble be
tween the" wets" and" drys" here.
Etherington and twenty others, all
eaid to be" dry" detectives, came here
from Cleveland and other places to
get evidence against" near beer" sa
loons. At the first place no trouble
arose. At the second Charles Richards
, the bartender, was handcuffed
for over an hour. At the third place
visited the trouble started.
A mob of 2,000 gathered and threatened
the detectives. With revolvers
drawn the Anti- Saloon league officers
retreated to a hotel. The police interfered
there, arresting eight of the
detectives.
The remaining twelve detectives
broke and ran, pursued by the howling
mob. Half a dozen were caught and
beaten. The police rescued most of
them. A downtown crowd fell on
James Henderson of Columbus, and
beat him o severely that he was
taken to the Newark hospital. Ether
ingto, who hed to the ball park,
stumbled in his flight and the crowd
set upon him. Howard, the proprietor
of a" near beer" saloon, the last place
searched by the detectives, was in
front of Etherington when the latter
drew a revolver and fired.
Etherington was hurried to the jail
with a yelling mob at the heels of the
police who were protecting him. All
afternoon the crowd stormed about
the place threatening to lynch the detective

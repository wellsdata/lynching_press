F
NEW TRIAL FOR WILLIAMS.
Negro Saved From Carrollton Mob
Gets Another Chance.
Atlanta, July 19.- Ike Williams, the
negro who came near being lynched by
a mob at Carrolton, a little more than
a month ago, will get a new trial. His
case was passed on to this effect by
the Supreme Court to- day. The Supreme
Court held that the evidence
upon which Williams was convicted
was clearly circumstantial, and re
versed the lower court in its conviction.
It is said that there was never any
greater excitement in Carroll county,
than when the mob attempted to lynch
Ike Williams, by storming the jail at
Carrollton

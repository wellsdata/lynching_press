A Negro Lynched by Negroes.
A negro named Edward Bell was
taken from three constables near Selma
, Ala., Aug. 6, by a mob composed
largely of his own race and was hanged
to a tree, his body being riddled
with bullets. Bell had been arrested
for killing another and was to
await the action of the negro grand jury.

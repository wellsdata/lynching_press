Victim Expresses Regret
Warner, 19, had confessed attack
ing a young white woman, whose
name was withheld by agreement.
The girl was in a hospital here,
mutilated for life, yet she expressed
sorrow for the lynching.
" It would have been better the
other way, don't you think?" she
said, saying that the law should
have had its way with her attacker.
She was concerned over whether the
mob killed the right man.
She was seized by the Negro Sun
day night after she alighted from a
bus near her home. He dragged her
into an alley, her life
with a long knife threatening, she said.

EXECUTIVE PARDONS- Governor George
Stoneman has granted pardons as follows to
parties in the State Prison: H. T. Garrett,
& San Francisco burglar; C. J. Hutchinson,
a forger. He also commuted the sentence of
Carrie Norton, so that she will be released
from custody in June next. She, in connec-
tion with her paramour, Jack Cotton, murdered
her husband in 1876. The murder was
looked upon as cold- blooded and fiendish, and
the pair came near being lynched at the time
by the excited populace at Santa Barbara.
They had a trial, which was prolonged for
weeks, resulting in their both being sent to
the State Prison for life. Mrs. Norton seems
to have had friends with money and influence
, who have, since her incarceration, been
importuning the different Governors for her
pardon, or at least a commutation of her sentence
. Governors and Perkins refused
to consider their petitions Irwin.

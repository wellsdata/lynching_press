WEATHERFORD OPINION.
Weatherford Tex., Feb. 2 .-( Special.)
The summary justice, dealt out to Henry
Smith for the horrible erime which he
confessed, by a justly enraged populace
fully meets the hearty approval and comed
mendation of all classes of citizens. It
was indeed a horrible death, but then it
was fiendish, diabolical crime, and all
of this a people think as one man that
desperate cases require the most desperate
remedies. Even his colored brethren
are in exact concord with the spirit
mandfested and exhibited by the citizens
of Paris and of Lamar county, and more
like unto the one just played will
acts have a civilizing effect on all wrong doers.

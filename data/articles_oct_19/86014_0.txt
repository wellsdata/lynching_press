to Bail.
About two o'clock' this morning a mob,
estimated at from twenty- five to forty
in number, masked and heavily armed,
went to the jail in Salem, Indiana, and
demanded the keys of the from the
deputy sheriff. He refused jail them; they,
however found the key to the outside
,
door of the jail, and then took a sledge
hammer and knocked the locks and
fastenings from the cell- door, in which
was confined Delos Heffren, charged
with the murder of D. Halstead, a few
days ago. Heffren showed fight, but
retreated to the inner cell, when the
mob threw fire balls into the cell, and
while they were burning they'fired, two
or three shots hitting him. There
were twenty- two or twenty- three
balls picked in all where Heffren
up
stood. After wounding him, they took
him to the railroad bridge, about thirty
rods from the depot, and hung him,
after which the mob disappeared as suddenly
and mysteriously as it appeared.
About four o'clock Heffren was taken
down. At the coroner's inquest the ex-
amining physician said the shots which
hit him would not have produced death.
There is a terrible excitement in the
town.

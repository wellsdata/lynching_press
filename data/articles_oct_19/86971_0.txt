A Short Shrift.
WACO, Tex., Jan. 3.- At 2 o'clock
yesterday afternoon Charles Beall, a ne
gro, 20 years of age, entered the residence
of Mr. James Fisher, a farmer near
Lang, Falls county, thirty miles south of
Waco, and, finding Mrs. Fisher alone,
subjected her to the vilest indignities and
cruelty, breaking her skull with a ham
mer.
He then looted the house and left,
taking away a small sum of money and a
few articles of value. Neighbors called
and found Mrs. Fisher still alive. She
rallied enough to tell her story and de
scribe her assailant. A party of young
men, well armed and mounted on fleet
horses, took the trail, and at 2 o'clock
this morning they had the negro captured
. He was caught not far from
Cameron, in Milan county. The
lynchers took him back to the residence
of the victim. who identified him,
upon which he confessed. After this
Beall got shortest shrift. He was taken to
a grove and allowed time to pray, after
which a three- quarter inch manilla rope
was noosed on his neck, and he was
dragged to a tree and hoisted to a bough,
upon which he dangied until this morn
ing, when an inquest was held by Justice
Hedrick, of Lott. The verdict was:
Hauged until dead by unknown parties.
Mrs. Fisher was alive at noon, but there
was no hope of recover. Her skull was
shivered, and a portion of her brain was
spilled upon the floor. After striking
the lady with the hammer the negro
chopped off part of her cheek and one ear
with a hatchet. Mr. Fisher was absent
at a neighbor's helping build a house, and
the children were at school. Charles
Beall, the negro, was raised by Mr. Fisher,
and was a trusted servant in house
hold. the

WACO, TEXAS.- Every day brings
new arrivals here of people moving
from the drouth- stricken counties in
the west of texas. Many of them are
completely dis-
almost destitute an
couraged: They say they want to lo
cate where it rains a few times each
year. There is also something of an in-
flux of colored people from Comanche
county. Since the lynching of a col-
ored rapist and murderer at DeLeon on
Monday the negroes have been ordered
leave Comanche, and they have
to obeyed.

CLOSE TO DEATH.
Trainmen Tell Stories of Their Nar-
row Escapes.
At the trainmen's convention in Denver
a number of delegates were telling their
narrow escapes from death on the rail
W. H. Wilson, a trainman on the B.&
O. said:
" I had a call from death once that
was so close that to this day my breath
catches when I think of it," said Mr.
Wilson." It was a dozen years ago and
I was breaking on a Baltimore& Ohio
freight train. We handle cars of different
sizes in carrying coal, but we became
so used to them that we could run
along a string of cars on the darkest
night in safety.
" Once, on a certain night it was so
dark that a man could hardly see a foot
ahead of him. We were coming down
to a hill and I went out on the train
to set the brakes. I was running along
on the cars and suddenly fell betweeen
two cars.
" I screamed the instant I fell, for I
was. sure I would be bround to bits. I
remember screaming and the next instant
I was floundering in water. I had
fallen through a culvert into a creek.
You see that culvert came in handy.
How in the world I dropped between the
ties of that culvert is a mystery. I was

seen my light go out and heard me
scream. The train was stopped, and the
boys came back, expecting to find me in
bits. They found me drenched to the
skin and swearing emphatically."
" I had a call nearly as close," spoke
up William Brennan of Hartford, Conn.,
" I was standing on the second car of a
freight train one night going through
Danbury, Conn. They have overhead

high and we have always cleared them.
I must have been on an unusually high
car, for the trolley wire caught me
square in the face. I never remembered
a thing for three days.
" When I was found I was lying on
top of the eighth car in the train, six
cars back from where I was standing
when I was caught. The wire must
have raised me from my feet and held
me six cars. I've got this scar across
my face as a souvenir of that experience
. I don't understand today why the
electricity in the trolley wire didn't kill
me."

once," said G. E. McClelland, of Richmond

hands in an effort to shove myself clear
of the train. This I failed to do, but
flattened myself out so that I fell on

cars passed over me. One of the boys

" I worked one day once; made one
trip and quit. I said I'd never go in
the railroad business, but I did," said
J. A. Wesmeyer, of Denver, to a knot
of the boys." I was on the Alton work
ing on a freight. I was sent ahead to
flag a passenger train. It was as dark
as the inside of a cow. As I was run

were swinging from the bridge over the
the Mississippi river at Louisiana, Mo. That
was the limit. I started on the dead
run clear across the bridge and tore
clear up to the passenger train at the
depot in Louisiana. I was so scared
that I was speechless, and it is a fact
that for three days I was in bed and
speechless."
POWER OF THE IMAGINATION.
" I have been in a half dozen wrecks,"
the said H. P. Howe, of the Boston&
Maine at Worcester, Mass." I know
once I was caught in a freight mix- up
and was pulled out from a stack of
broken cars. It is a fact that I was
not hurt, but I believed that I had re
- ceived fatal injuries. It just shows you
that a man's brain works as much
damage as an actual injury."
" That's a fact," said William H.
Keeler, of the Long Island road at Long
" I got my finger pinched
off in the o
& off in the old link and pin days in the
Delaware& Hudson yards in Albany/
At the time I was convinced that I
had been killed. It was several hours
before I realized that I was not going
to die. It was all imagination."
These are just a few experiences. If
you want to hear how men flirt with
death and with laughter talk to the B. R.
T delegates.
HEARD THEM RESCUING HIM.
" I was in a wreck once on the Texas and
Pacific when I thought my time had
come," said C. G. Hawkins, of Winslow,
so Ariz.
" It was a freight and we butted
head on into another freight train. I was
on top of one of the cars and was thrown
underneath a dozen cars that were stacked
up in ditch. It an

A GEORGIA REPUBLICAN .-" You Republicans
in the North don't know what the term' Republ.
canism' means in the State of Georgia," said John
T. White, colored, publisher of" The Georgia Baptist
." Mr. White is a young man with a bulging
forehead and a pleasing manner, and he was enjoying
himself in the throng at the Walton on
Tuesday afternoon when he dropped the remark.
" A few days ago," continued he," I reprinted a
paragraph from a Washington paper reflecting on
the conduct of a mob that conducted a lynching in
Georgia, and five hundred' crackers' waited on me
at my house and intimated that there'd be' some
doing, as you say up here, if I didn't move
thing away."

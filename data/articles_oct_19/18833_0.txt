POLICEMAN RESIGNS:
TALK OF PERSECUTION
AFTER MANY YEARS OF SERVICE
AUGUSTA OFFICER GIVES UP
PLACE ON THE FORCE.
AUGUSTA, Ga., Feb. 15.- Policeman L.
H. Krewson resigned from the force yesterday
. A charge of neglect of duty has
been made against him and he was to
have been tried last night under that
charge. He was tried only a month ago on
a similar charge and acquitted.
Mr. Krewson was one of the oldest
members on the force in point of service,
and had been sergeant for many years. He
was in command of the squad who repelled
the attack on the jail three years
ago when a mob went there to lynch a
negro who had assaulted a lady in the
city. In that attack two men were seriously
wounded. Sergeant Krewson was
reduced to the ranks when the force was
reorganized last summer.
There are those who see in the repeated
charges brought against this officer a systematic
persecution for the purpose of
him from the force, and that still
driving others will go the same way.

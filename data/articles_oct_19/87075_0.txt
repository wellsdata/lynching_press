NEGROES BEAT UP
A MILITIAMAN
Mob Nearly Lynched Negroes Who
Attacked Private In Washing
ton City.
Washington, July 26.- George M.
H. Bennett, a private in the District
National Guard, is in a hospital to
day with a fractured skull, and three
of his negro assailants are in jail
awaiting the outcome of his injuries.
Bennett, it is believed, will die. The
negroes were rescued with difficulty
from an infuriated crowd of Bennett's
mates; two mounted policemen
holding the guardsmen off. Three
companions of the negroes, who
joined in the attack on Bennett, made
their escape, and are being sought
by the police.
The trouble had its inception early
yesterday, when Bennett, who was
doing sentry duty at the rifle range
used by the National Guard, received
a short answer from one of the ne- 1
groes when he issued a command.
The sentry sought to use his bayonet
, whereupon the negro fled.
Shortly afterward Bennett, who
had been relieved from sentry duty,
left a baseball game between two
companions of the regiment and
started back to camp. When a short
distance from his tent he was set
upon by six negroes and severely
beaten. When his plight was dis
covered he was unconscious, but
three of the negroes were overtaken
by the pursuers. They were rescued
with difficulty by the mounted po
lice.
Early this morning an operation
was performed on Bennett, in the
hope of saving his life. The surgeons
, however, said he had silm
chances for recovery

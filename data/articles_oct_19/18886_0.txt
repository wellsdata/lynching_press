Arrival of the Prometheus- Later from California.
NEW YORK, Aug. 13.
The steamer Prometheus, with San Juan dates to
the 4th August, and San Francisco dates to the 15th
July, arrived here to- day, having on board 300 pas-
sengers,$ 200,000 in gold, as freight, and$ 400,000
in the of passengers. The passengers express
great satisfaction with the Nicaragua route.
We learn, by the reports from San Francisco, that
a desperado named James Stuart was hung by Lynch
law at that place on the 11th of July, in the presence
of 5,000 people. Citizens of other towns in California
were adopting vigorous measures to protect them
selves from the criminal acts of this set of men, the
laws being found inadequate to that purpose.
The steamer Manchester City arrived at
phia to- day. Philadel
